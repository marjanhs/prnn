EN347	0	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all the same mopin' and lazin' in it. It's the bad luck I've been havin' altogether this last year since your mother died. Who's to do the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. hat a fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a millionaire! Mary, dear, it's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most. What are you sniffin' at?  I was thinking--of Mamma.  It's late you are with your tears, and her cold in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!  Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself?  Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I beat him.  Slow poke!  You didn't beat me, neither!  I did, too!  You did not! You didn't play fair. You tripped me comin' up the steps. Brick-top! Cheater!  You're a liar! You stumbled over your own big feet, clumsy bones! And I beat you fair Didn't I, Papa?  You did, darlin', and fair, too. Sure it's you can beat the divil himself!  See? Liar!  Did you get the plug for me I told you?
EN346	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$'Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things to do: and you, too, Barbara. They are leaving in an hour, John.'  'If you would like to take Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the garden.'  'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'  'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'  'But there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'  'Let me, dear,'  'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'  'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is. There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew, he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go to the alder pool, Barbara.'  'We won't go there, dear.'  'Did I do all right, Ellen?'  'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'  'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion! I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'  'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to you; you like that, don't you?'  'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No, I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'  'Barbara?'  'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'  'Which bit shall I read?'  'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.' 'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun to laugh already.'  'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'  'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish? Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'  'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'  'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'  'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but something prevents him.'  'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'  'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better. Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'  'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little light?'  'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it helps one to concentrate.'   'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you still there?'  'I think I felt a movement.'  'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'  'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'  'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'  'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'  'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'  'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with A?--with B? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the fourth word Welcome? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me Welcome.'
EN419	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$I never killed my father. I'd be afeard to do that, except I was the like of yourself with blind rages tearing me within, for I'm thinking you should have had great tussling when the end was come.  We had not then. It was a hard woman was come over the hill, and if he was always a crusty kind when he'd a hard woman setting him on, not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up with him at all.  And isn't it a great wonder that one wasn't fearing you?  Up to the day I killed my father, there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no man giving me heed.  It was the girls were giving you heed maybe, and I'm thinking it's most conceit you'd have to be gaming with their like.  Not the girls itself, and I won't tell you a lie. There wasn't anyone heeding me in that place saving only the dumb beasts of the field.  And I thinking you should have been living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world.  The like of a king, is it? And I after toiling, moiling, digging, dodging from the dawn till dusk with never a sight of joy or sport saving only when I'd be abroad in the dark night poaching rabbits on hills, for I was a devil to poach, God forgive me, and I near got six months for going with a dung fork and stabbing a fish.  And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?  I did, God help me, and there I'd be as happy as the sunshine of St. Martin's Day, watching the light passing the north or the patches of fog, till I'd hear a rabbit starting to screech and I'd go running in the furze.

You will come up, mater?'  'Yes, dear. I shan't be five minutes, John.'  'More like half an hour.'  'There is nothing wrong, is there? I thought I noticed a--a----'  'A certain liveliness, my dear. No, we were only having a good talk.'  'What about, John?'  'About the war,'  'About tactics and strategy, wasn't it, Roger?'  'Yes.'  'The fact is, Ellen, I have been helping Roger to take his first trench.' With a big breath, 'And we took it too, together, didn't we, Roger?'  'You bet,'  'Though I suppose,' sighing, 'it is one of those trenches that the enemy retake during the night.'  'Oh, I--I don't know, father.'  'Whatever are you two talking about?'  'Aha, it is very private. We don't tell you everything, you know, Ellen.'  'Come on, mater, it's only his beastly sarcasm again. 'Night, father; I won't see you in the morning.'  ''Night,'  'Good-night, dear father.'  'A beautiful morning, Dering.'  'Too much sun, sir. The roses be complaining, and, to make matters worse, Miss Barbara has been watering of them--in the heat of the day.'  'Has she? She means well. Dering, you heard it, didn't you?'  'What was that, sir?'  'The thunderstorm--early this morning.'  'There was no thunderstorm, sir.'  'That is what they all say. It was at four o'clock. I got up and looked out at the window. The evening primroses were very beautiful.'  'I don't hold much with evening primroses, sir; but I was out and about at four; there was no thunderstorm.'  'I suppose I just thought there was one. Perhaps it was some thunderstorm of long ago that I heard. They do come back, you know.'  'Do they, sir?'  'I am glad to see you moving about in the garden, Dering, with everything just as usual.'  'Thank you, sir.'  'No, don't go. I am--a little troubled, Dering.'  'Everything be all right, sir.'  'I'm glad of that,' the Colonel says with relief. 'It is pleasant to see that you have come back, Dering. Why did you go away for such a long time?'  'Me, sir?' Dering is a little aggrieved. 'I haven't had a day off since Christmas.'  'Haven't you? I thought--'  'Is everything just as usual, Dering?'  'Yes, sir. There never were a place less changed than this.'  'That's true.' The Colonel is appeased. 'Thank you, Dering, for saying that.' But next moment he has lowered his voice again. 'Dering, there is nothing wrong, is there? Is anything happening that I am not being told about?'  'Not that I know of, sir.'  'That is what they all say, but--I don't know. Dering, I feel as if I was needed somewhere. I don't know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is every one?'  'They're all about, sir. There's a cricket match on at the village green.'  'Is there?'  'If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices. You were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.'  'Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggest score I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred, but I wouldn't let them. I was pretty good at steering them through the slips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didn't matter where point stood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.'  'That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snap you regular at point.'  'Did he? I daresay he did. I can't play now, but I like to watch it still.' 'Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I don't understand it, Dering. When I got there the green was all dotted with them--it's the prettiest sight and sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, one and two at a time; they weren't given out, you know, they went as if they had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--and then they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps were left lying about. Why is it?'  'It's just fancy, sir, I saw Master Will oiling his bat yesterday.'

I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a sheep.  It's true the Lord God formed you to contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?  Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?  Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her pigsty and not plague us here.  I'm going; but he'll come with me.  Are you dumb, young fellow?  God increase you; but I'm pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.  Now you have heard him, and go on from this.  It's lonesome this hour crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.  Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will send you now.  Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.  What's that she's after saying?
EN410	0	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother. I was just like her when I was that age.  And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.  Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I think the show is about to begin. Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical! Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical! Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks! Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks! Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled, Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld, The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man, Aerial Artists from far-off Japan, Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun, Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!  Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old, to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcel post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife.
EN413	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$For every one, etc.  Sing high, sing low, Wherever they go, They all shall equal be!  Then hail! O King, Whichever you may be, To you we sing, But do not bend the knee. Then hail! O King.    Come, let's away--our island crown awaits me-- Conflicting feelings rend my soul apart! The thought of Royal dignity elates me, But leaving thee behind me breaks my heart!    Farewell, my love; on board you must be getting; But while upon the sea you gaily roam, Remember that a heart for thee is fretting-- The tender little heart you've left at home!  Now, Marco dear, My wishes hear: While you're away It's understood You will be good And not too gay. To every trace Of maiden grace You will be blind, And will not glance By any chance On womankind!  If you are wise, You'll shut your eyes Till we arrive, And not address A lady less Than forty-five. You'll please to frown On every gown That you may see; And, O my pet, You won't forget You've married me!  And O my darling, O my pet, Whatever else you may forget, In yonder isle beyond the sea, Do not forget you've married me!  You'll lay your head Upon your bed At set of sun. You will not sing Of anything To any one. You'll sit and mope All day, I hope, And shed a tear Upon the life Your little wife Is passing here.  And if so be You think of me, Please tell the moon! I'll read it all In rays that fall On the lagoon: You'll be so kind As tell the wind How you may be, And send me words By little birds To comfort me!
EN412	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$'I'll try not to,'  'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong about me.'  'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN415	1	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$Sure.  It's a great wonder you didn't forget it--and me without a chew.  Ouch! Darn you!  Shut your big mouth! What is the matter with you at all?  She pinched me--hard as she could, too--and look at her laughin'!  Cry-baby! I owed you one.  I'll fix you. I'll tell Eileen, wait 'n' see!  Tattle-tale! I don't care. Eileen's sick.  That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get even, you bet!  Shut up your noise! Go up to bed, the two of you, and no more talk, and you go with them, Mary.  Come on, Mary. Wake up.  Ow!  Hush your noise, you soft, weak thing, you! It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the time. I'll have a moment's peace, I will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!  Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?  No. The doctor's with her yet. Yes, go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.

It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Who's there?  Me.  Who's me?  The Widow Quin.  Go on now with your supper, and let on to be sleepy, for if she found you were such a warrant to talk, she'd be stringing gabble till the dawn of day.  What ails you, or what is it you're wanting at this hour of the night?  I'm after meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below, who told me of your curiosity man, and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring, romping on your hands with drink.  Look now is he roaring, and he stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk. Walk down and tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh.  I'll not see them again, for I've their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me.  This night, is it?  This night. "It isn't fitting," says the priesteen, "to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl."  God save you, mister!  God save you kindly.  Well, aren't you a little smiling fellow? It should have been great and bitter torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood.  It should, maybe.  It's more than "maybe" I'm saying, and it'd soften my heart to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake, and you fitter to be saying your catechism than slaying your da.  There's talking when any'd see he's fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world. Walk on from this, for I'll not have him tormented and he destroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week.  We'll be walking surely when his supper's done, and you'll find we're great company, young fellow, when it's of the like of you and me you'd hear the penny poets singing in an August Fair.  Did you kill your father?  She did not. She hit himself with a worn pick, and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never overed it, and died after. That was a sneaky kind of murder did win small glory with the boys itself.
EN417	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'

The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.

A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.

I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport.

"Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be.

I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now.

It's late you are with your tears, and her cold in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!  Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself?  Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I beat him.  Slow poke!  You didn't beat me, neither!

And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."
EN079	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Then I run, and I run, and I run, till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain

Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$'Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things to do: and you, too, Barbara. They are leaving in an hour, John.'  'If you would like to take Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the garden.'  'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'  'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'  'But there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'  'Let me, dear,'  'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'  'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is. There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew, he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go to the alder pool, Barbara.'  'We won't go there, dear.'  'Did I do all right, Ellen?'  'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'  'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion! I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'  'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to you; you like that, don't you?'  'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No, I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'  'Barbara?'  'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'  'Which bit shall I read?'  'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.' 'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun to laugh already.'  'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'  'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish? Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'  'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'  'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'  'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but something prevents him.'  'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'  'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better. Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'  'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little light?'  'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it helps one to concentrate.'   'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you still there?'  'I think I felt a movement.'  'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'  'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'  'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'  'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'  'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'  'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with A?--with B? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the fourth word Welcome? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me Welcome.'
EN077	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all the same mopin' and lazin' in it. It's the bad luck I've been havin' altogether this last year since your mother died. Who's to do the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. hat a fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a millionaire! Mary, dear, it's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most. What are you sniffin' at?  I was thinking--of Mamma.  It's late you are with your tears, and her cold in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!  Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself?  Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I beat him.  Slow poke!  You didn't beat me, neither!  I did, too!  You did not! You didn't play fair. You tripped me comin' up the steps. Brick-top! Cheater!  You're a liar! You stumbled over your own big feet, clumsy bones! And I beat you fair Didn't I, Papa?  You did, darlin', and fair, too. Sure it's you can beat the divil himself!  See? Liar!  Did you get the plug for me I told you?
EN076	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$If we did, my lady, the first thing we should do would be to elect a head. Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?
EN075	0	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Do not give way to this uncalled-for grief, Your separation will be very brief. To ascertain which is the King And which the other, To Barataria's Court I'll bring His foster-mother; Her former nurseling to declare She'll be delighted. That settled, let each happy pair Be reunited. Viva! His argument is strong! Viva! We'll not be parted long! Viva! It will be settled soon! Viva! Then comes our honeymoon!    Then one of us will be a Queen, And sit on a golden throne, With a crown instead Of a hat on her head, And diamonds all her own! With a beautiful robe of gold and green, I've always understood; I wonder whether She'd wear a feather? I rather think she should!  Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, To be a regular Royal Queen! No half-and-half affair, I mean, But a right-down regular Royal Queen!  She'll drive about in a carriage and pair, With the King on her left-hand side, And a milk-white horse, As a matter of course, Whenever she wants to ride! With beautiful silver shoes to wear Upon her dainty feet; With endless stocks Of beautiful frocks And as much as she wants to eat!  Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.  Whenever she condescends to walk, Be sure she'll shine at that, With her haughty stare And her nose in the air, Like a well-born aristocrat! At elegant high society talk She'll bear away the bell, With her "How de do?" And her "How are you?" And "I trust I see you well!"  ALL. Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.  GIU. And noble lords will scrape and bow, And double themselves in two, And open their eyes In blank surprise At whatever she likes to do. And everybody will roundly vow She's fair as flowers in May,
EN074	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Who's there?  Me.  Who's me?  The Widow Quin.  Go on now with your supper, and let on to be sleepy, for if she found you were such a warrant to talk, she'd be stringing gabble till the dawn of day.  What ails you, or what is it you're wanting at this hour of the night?  I'm after meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below, who told me of your curiosity man, and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring, romping on your hands with drink.  Look now is he roaring, and he stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk. Walk down and tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh.  I'll not see them again, for I've their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me.  This night, is it?  This night. "It isn't fitting," says the priesteen, "to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl."  God save you, mister!  God save you kindly.  Well, aren't you a little smiling fellow? It should have been great and bitter torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood.  It should, maybe.  It's more than "maybe" I'm saying, and it'd soften my heart to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake, and you fitter to be saying your catechism than slaying your da.  There's talking when any'd see he's fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world. Walk on from this, for I'll not have him tormented and he destroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week.  We'll be walking surely when his supper's done, and you'll find we're great company, young fellow, when it's of the like of you and me you'd hear the penny poets singing in an August Fair.  Did you kill your father?  She did not. She hit himself with a worn pick, and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never overed it, and died after. That was a sneaky kind of murder did win small glory with the boys itself.
EN073	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."
EN072	1	She hasn't come yet, is it, and it falling to the night?  She has not. . . It's dark with the clouds are coming from the west and south, but it isn't later than the common.  It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not. Would you have him see you, and he a man would be jealous of a hawk would fly between her and the rising sun.

There'll be trouble this night, for he should be in his tempers from the way he's stepping out, and he swinging his hands.  wearied with the whole matter. -- It'd be best of all, maybe, if he got in tempers with herself, and made an end quickly, for I'm in a poor way between the pair of them. There they are now at the door.  The gods save you.  getting up and courtesy-ing. -- The gods save and keep you kindly, and stand between you and all harm for ever.  Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  Bring them out and use them from this day.  We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor. All say there isn't her match at fancying figures and throwing purple upon crimson, and she edging them all times with her greens and gold.  a little uneasily. -- Is she keeping wise and busy since I passed before, and growing ready for her life in Emain?  dryly. -- That is a question will give small pleasure to yourself or me. If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.
EN071	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings.

You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$I did not then. I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of it on the ridge of his skull, and he went down at my feet like an empty sack, and never let a grunt or groan from him at all.  And what way weren't you hanged, mister? Did you bury him then?  Aye. I buried him then. Wasn't I digging spuds in the field?  And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that you're out?  Never a one of them, and I walking forward facing hog, dog, or divil on the highway of the road.  It's only with a common week-day kind of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase, and that man should be a great terror when his temper's roused.  He should then. And where was it, mister honey, that you did the deed?  Oh, a distant place, master of the house, a windy corner of high, distant hills.  He's a close man, and he's right, surely.  That'd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a pot-boy, Michael James, if it's the truth you're seeking one at all.  The peelers is fearing him, and if you'd that lad in the house there isn't one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard.  Bravery's a treasure in a lonesome place, and a lad would kill his father, I'm thinking, would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on the flags of hell.  It's the truth they're saying, and if I'd that lad in the house, I wouldn't be fearing the loosed kharki cut-throats, or the walking dead.  Well, glory be to God!  Would you think well to stop here and be pot-boy, mister honey, if we gave you good wages, and didn't destroy you with the weight of work?  That'd be a queer kind to bring into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike.  Will you whisht? Who's speaking to you?
EN070	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN257	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my nose. It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about the rain, and Darcy the devil choke him--and the towering church. Give me that whisky. Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all?  Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.  Is it that?  It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a bad wife in the house.  Is it herself, master of the house, and she a grand woman to talk?  It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still. Let you wait now a short while, and it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. Is that somebody above?  There's a voice speaking on the path.  Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying. Be falling to sleep now and don't let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life. I wouldn't have told you at all but it's destroyed with the drouth I was.  Have no fear, master of the house. What is it I know of the like of you that I'ld be saying a word or putting out my
EN256	0	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.

Anybody feel funny dat vay in fog.  But why d'you s'pose I feel so--so--like I'd found something I'd missed and been looking for--'s if this was the right place for me to fit in? And I seem to have forgot--everything that's happened--like it didn't matter no more. And I feel clean, somehow--like you feel yust after you've took a bath. And I feel happy for once--yes, honest!--happier than I ever been anywhere before! It's nutty for me to feel that way, don't you think?  Ay tank Ay'm damn fool for bring you on voyage, Anna.  You talk--nutty to-night yourself. You act's if you was scared something was going to happen.  CHRIS--Only God know dat, Anna.  Then it'll be Gawd's will, like the preachers say-what does happen.  No! Dat ole davil, sea, she ain't God! "Ahoy!"  What's that?  Py golly, dat scare me for minute. It's only some fallar hail, Anna--loose his course in fog. Must be fisherman's power boat. His engine break down, Ay guess. Sound from dis side. She come in from open sea. Ahoy, dere! Vhat's trouble?  Heave a rope when we come alongside. Where are ye, ye scut?  Ay hear dem rowing. Dey come up by bow, Ay tank. Dis vay!  Right ye are!  Why don't that guy stay where he belongs?  Ay go up bow. All hands asleep 'cepting fallar on vatch. Ay gat heave line to dat fallar. Anna! You come help, vill you? You find vhiskey in cabin. Dese fallars need drink for fix dem. Dey vas near dead.  Sure--but who are they? What's the trouble?  Sailor fallars. Deir steamer gat wrecked. Dey been five days in open boat--four fallars--only one left able stand up. Come, Anna. Go gat oder fallar, Yohnson.  Yes, sir.  Row, ye divil! Row! What's this tub? Well, we're safe anyway--with the help of God. Is it losing the small wits ye iver had, ye are? Deck-scrubbing scut! I'm bate out--bate out entirely.  Here you are. Here's a drink for you. You need it, I guess.$$$Sure.  It's a great wonder you didn't forget it--and me without a chew.  Ouch! Darn you!  Shut your big mouth! What is the matter with you at all?  She pinched me--hard as she could, too--and look at her laughin'!  Cry-baby! I owed you one.  I'll fix you. I'll tell Eileen, wait 'n' see!  Tattle-tale! I don't care. Eileen's sick.  That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get even, you bet!  Shut up your noise! Go up to bed, the two of you, and no more talk, and you go with them, Mary.  Come on, Mary. Wake up.  Ow!  Hush your noise, you soft, weak thing, you! It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the time. I'll have a moment's peace, I will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!  Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?  No. The doctor's with her yet. Yes, go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
EN254	1	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN253	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$That's five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It's not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke, and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good.  What was it you got?  Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.  Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....  Son of God deliver us.  Now you'll not marry her the time I'm rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.
EN252	1	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.   I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite, If any wonders you have seen this night?  I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light  Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.  Tell me, for thou art native of this place, What dost thou know about the King of Grace-- King of the Jews?   Aye, in Jerusalem He dwells, and not in Bethlehem. He sits upon his mighty judgment throne, Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.   I mean a new-born King, of love and peace; His is the star--His reign shall never cease.   All things tonight seem passing strange to me, I have just read an ancient prophecy That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town, Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown, Of one called Councillor of King David's line Whose coming is foretold in words divine. And now you come with words of mystery! Why should thy questions, which are dark to me, Cause me to think of Him?   The star! The star! No more it moves about the heavens afar, It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray, For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!   His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within And seek protection in my humble inn.    Three kings came riding from far away, Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar; Three wise men out of the east were they, And they traveled by night and they slept by day, For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.   The star was so beautiful, large and clear, That all other stars of the sky Became a white mist in the atmosphere; And by this they knew that the coming was near Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.
EN251	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--

Farewell.$$$In the regrettable slang of the servants' hall, my lady, the master is usually referred to as the Gov.  I see. You--  Yes, I understand that is what they call me.  You didn't even take your meals with the family?  No, my lady, I dined apart.  You, girl, also? Did you dine with Crichton?  No, your ladyship.  With whom?  I took my bit of supper with--with Daddy and Polly and the rest.  Dear old Daddy--he was our monkey. You remember our monkey, Agatha?  Rather! What a funny old darling he was.  And don't you think Polly was the sweetest little parrot, Mary?  Ah! I understand; animals you had domesticated?  Quite so--quite so.  The servants' teas that used to take place here once a month--  They did not seem natural on the island, my lady, and were discontinued by the Gov.'s orders.  A clear proof, Loam, that they were a mistake here.  I admit it frankly. I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I think of going over to the Tories.  I am delighted to hear it.  Thank you, Crichton, thank you; that is all.  One moment. Young people, Crichton, will be young people, even on an island; now, I suppose there was a certain amount of--shall we say sentimentalising, going on? Yes, my lady, there was.  Mother!  Which gentleman? You, girl, tell me.  If you please, my lady--  The fact is--  It was him--Mr. Ernest, your ladyship.  With which lady?  I have already told you, Lady Brocklehurst, that Ernest and I--  Yes, now; but you were two years on the island. Was it this lady?  No, your ladyship.  Then I don't care which of the others it was. Well, I suppose that will do.  Do! I hope you are ashamed of yourself, mother. You are an excellent fellow, Crichton; and if, after we are married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.  Oh no, impossible--  Why impossible? Do you see why it should be impossible, my man?  Yes, my lady. I had not told you, my lord, but as soon as your lordship is suited I wish to leave service.  What will you do, Crichton?  Shall I withdraw, my lord?  Horrid of me, wasn't it? But if one wasn't disagreeable now and again, it would be horribly tedious to be an old woman. He will soon be yours, Mary, and then--think of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to me. On that understanding, my dear, don't you think we might--?  Quite so--quite so. To wish you every dear happiness.  The same to you, my lady.  Do you despise me, Crichton? You are the best man among us.  On an island, my lady, perhaps; but in England, no.  Then there's something wrong with England.  My lady, not even from you can I listen to a word against England.  Tell me one thing: you have not lost your courage?  No, my lady.

Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.

Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi.

Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Yes, that's the sort of politician for my money!  Then we'll consider it settled. Now, as the country is in a state of insurrection, it is absolutely necessary that you should assume the reins of Government at once; and, until it is ascertained which of you is to be king, I have arranged that you will reign jointly, so that no question can arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts.  As one individual?  As one individual.  Like this?  Something like that.  And we may take our friends with us, and give them places about the Court?  Undoubtedly. That's always done!  I'm convinced!  So am I!  Then the sooner we're off the better.  We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)--  Stop, stop--that won't do at all--ladies are not admitted.  What!  Not admitted. Not at present. Afterwards, perhaps. We'll see.  Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate us from our wives!  This is very awkward! Only for a time--a few months. Alter all, what is a few months?  But we've only been married half an hour!   Kind sir, you cannot have the heart Our lives to part From those to whom an hour ago We were united! Before our flowing hopes you stem, Ah, look at them, And pause before you deal this blow, All uninvited! You men can never understand That heart and hand Cannot be separated when We go a-yearning; You see, you've only women's eyes To idolize And only women's hearts, poor men, To set you burning! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!  Some kind of charm you seem to find In womankind-- Some source of unexplained delight (Unless you're jesting), But what attracts you, I confess, I cannot guess, To me a woman's face is quite Uninteresting! If from my sister I were torn, It could be borne-- I should, no doubt, be horrified, But I could bear it;-- But Marco's quite another thing-- He is my King, He has my heart and none beside Shall ever share it! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!
EN397	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$I'll take off anything else in reason.  But a Royal Salute to my daughter--it costs so little.  Papa, I don't want a salute.  My dear sir, as soon as we know which of us is entitled to take that liberty she shall have as man salutes as she likes.  As for guards of honour and triumphal arches, you don't know our people--they wouldn't stand it.  They are very off-hand with us--very off-hand indeed.  Oh, but you mustn't allow that--you must keep them in proper discipline, you must impress your Court with your importance. You want deportment--carriage--  We've got a carriage.  Manner--dignity. There must be a good deal of this sort of thing- and a little of this sort of thing- and possibly just a Soupcon of this sort of thing!- and so on. Oh, it's very useful, and most effective. Just attend to me. You are a King--I am a subject. Very good--  I am a courtier grave and serious Who is about to kiss your hand: Try to combine a pose imperious With a demeanour nobly bland.  Let us combine a pose imperious With a demeanour nobly bland.  That's, if anything, too unbending-- Too aggressively stiff and grand;  Now to the other extreme you're tending-- Don't be so deucedly condescending!  Now to the other extreme you're tending--Don't be so dreadfully condescending!  Oh, hard to please some noblemen seem! At first, if anything, too unbending; Off we go to the other extreme-- Too confoundedly condescending!  Now a gavotte perform sedately-- Offer your hand with conscious pride; Take an attitude not too stately, Still sufficiently dignified.  Now for an attitude not too stately, Still sufficiently dignified.
EN394	1	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.

'How am I looking, father?'  'You haven't altered, Dick.'  'Rather not. It's jolly to see the old studio again! I say, father, don't fuss. Let us be our ordinary selves, won't you?'  'I'll try, I'll try. You didn't say you had come to sit with me, Dick? Not with me!'  'Rather!'  'But your mother----'  'It's you I want.'  'Me?'  'We can only come to one, you see.'  'Then why me?'  'That's the reason. Hello, here's your old jacket, greasier than ever!'  'Me? But, Dick, it is as if you had forgotten. It was your mother who was everything to you. It can't be you if you have forgotten that. I used to feel so out of it; but, of course, you didn't know.'

I say, put on your old greasy; you are looking so beastly clean.'  'Anything you like. No, that's the wrong sleeve. Thanks, Dick.'  'Here, let me shove you into your old seat.'

You that pretend to be plucky! I won't have it, you know. You get your pipe, and look slippy about it.'  'Yes, Dick, Now, then, burn your thumb with the match--you always did, you know. That's the style. You've forgotten to cock your head to the side. Not so bad. That's you. Like it?'  'It's rather nice, Dick. Dick, you and me by the fire!'  'Yes, but sit still. How often we might have been like this, father, and weren't.'  'Ah!'  'Face. How is Fido?'  'Never a dog missed her master more.'  'Oh, She doesn't want to go and sit on my grave, or any of that tosh, does she? As if I were there!'  'No, no, she goes ratting, Dick.'  'Good old Fido!'  'Dick, here's a good one.

I says them gloating-like, in my head--'Blooming' I says, and 'All my eye,' and 'Ginger,' and 'Nothink'; and all the time we was being wrecked I was praying to myself, 'Please the Lord it may be an island as it's natural to be vulgar on.'  That's the kind I am, sir. I'm 'opeless. You'd better give me up.  I won't give you up. It is strange that one so common should attract one so fastidious; but so it is.

To work, to work.  Yes, sir.  Ernest, you be a little more civil. Crichton, let me help.  Is that--but I suppose I'm dreaming again. It isn't by any chance a pot on top of a fire, is it?  Indeed, it is, dearest. It is our supper.  I have been dreaming of a pot on a fire for two days. There 's nothing in it, is there?  Sniff, uncle.  It smells of onions!  Father, you have boots!  So he has.  Of course I have.  You are actually wearing boots, uncle. It's very unsafe, you know, in this climate.  Is it?  We have all abandoned them, you observe. The blood, the arteries, you know.  I hadn't a notion.  O Lord, yes.  Father, he is trying to get your boots from you. There is nothing in the world we wouldn't give for boots.  I only wanted the loan of them.  If you lend them to any one, it will be to us, won't it, father.  Certainly, my child.  Oh, very well. I don't want your old boots. You don't think you could spare me one boot?  I do not.  Quite so. Well, all I can say is I'm sorry for you.  Father, we thought we should never see you again.  I was washed ashore, my dear, clinging to a hencoop. How awful that first night was.  Poor father.  When I woke, I wept. Then I began to feel extremely hungry. There was a large turtle on the beach. I remembered from the Swiss Family Robinson that if you turn a turtle over he is helpless. My dears, I crawled towards him, I flung myself upon him the nasty, spiteful brute.
EN393	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.

This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."

Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?

Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'  'Yes, it was to a wedding.'  'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'  'Tell me, Ellen.'  'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'  'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'  'I thought you might be a little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.'  'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'  'It _is_ funny, John. I ran back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.'  'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'  'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'  'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'  'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'  'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too old yet.'  'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.'  'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard nothing.'  'Dering?'  'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'  'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'  'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'  'They have all gone to the war, John.'  'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'  'Oh, John!'  'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'  'Yes, I know, John.'  He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes here. He is a captain.'  'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'  'She has soon forgotten.'  'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'  'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'  'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'  'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'  'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may even have killed each other.'  'They hadn't known, Ellen.'  'I daresay they knew.'  'Billy boy and Karl!'  'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'  'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'  'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'  'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here, John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'  'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'  'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.'  'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'  'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'  'No, no, let's pretend.'  'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little touchy about that.'  'Not a word!'  'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'  'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'  'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'  'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'  'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'  'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'  'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'
EN258	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.
EN095	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$That's five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It's not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke, and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good.  What was it you got?  Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.  Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....  Son of God deliver us.  Now you'll not marry her the time I'm rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.

I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.

Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Humph! He's original in that opinion.  I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.
EN096	1	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$He's a hog on two legs.  You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.
EN091	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$Who's there?  Me.  Who's me?  The Widow Quin.  Go on now with your supper, and let on to be sleepy, for if she found you were such a warrant to talk, she'd be stringing gabble till the dawn of day.  What ails you, or what is it you're wanting at this hour of the night?  I'm after meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below, who told me of your curiosity man, and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring, romping on your hands with drink.  Look now is he roaring, and he stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk. Walk down and tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh.  I'll not see them again, for I've their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me.  This night, is it?  This night. "It isn't fitting," says the priesteen, "to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl."  God save you, mister!  God save you kindly.  Well, aren't you a little smiling fellow? It should have been great and bitter torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood.  It should, maybe.  It's more than "maybe" I'm saying, and it'd soften my heart to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake, and you fitter to be saying your catechism than slaying your da.  There's talking when any'd see he's fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world. Walk on from this, for I'll not have him tormented and he destroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week.  We'll be walking surely when his supper's done, and you'll find we're great company, young fellow, when it's of the like of you and me you'd hear the penny poets singing in an August Fair.  Did you kill your father?  She did not. She hit himself with a worn pick, and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never overed it, and died after. That was a sneaky kind of murder did win small glory with the boys itself.
EN090	0	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$For every one, etc.  Sing high, sing low, Wherever they go, They all shall equal be!  Then hail! O King, Whichever you may be, To you we sing, But do not bend the knee. Then hail! O King.    Come, let's away--our island crown awaits me-- Conflicting feelings rend my soul apart! The thought of Royal dignity elates me, But leaving thee behind me breaks my heart!    Farewell, my love; on board you must be getting; But while upon the sea you gaily roam, Remember that a heart for thee is fretting-- The tender little heart you've left at home!  Now, Marco dear, My wishes hear: While you're away It's understood You will be good And not too gay. To every trace Of maiden grace You will be blind, And will not glance By any chance On womankind!  If you are wise, You'll shut your eyes Till we arrive, And not address A lady less Than forty-five. You'll please to frown On every gown That you may see; And, O my pet, You won't forget You've married me!  And O my darling, O my pet, Whatever else you may forget, In yonder isle beyond the sea, Do not forget you've married me!  You'll lay your head Upon your bed At set of sun. You will not sing Of anything To any one. You'll sit and mope All day, I hope, And shed a tear Upon the life Your little wife Is passing here.  And if so be You think of me, Please tell the moon! I'll read it all In rays that fall On the lagoon: You'll be so kind As tell the wind How you may be, And send me words By little birds To comfort me!
EN093	1	She hasn't come yet, is it, and it falling to the night?  She has not. . . It's dark with the clouds are coming from the west and south, but it isn't later than the common.  It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not. Would you have him see you, and he a man would be jealous of a hawk would fly between her and the rising sun.

Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  Bring them out and use them from this day.  We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$I never married with one, let alone with a couple or three.  Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn. Were you off east, young fellow, fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the Boers?  I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week.  He's done nothing, so. If you didn't commit murder or a bad, nasty thing, or false coining, or robbery, or butchery, or the like of them, there isn't anything that would be worth your troubling for to run from now. You did nothing at all.  That's an unkindly thing to be saying to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging before, and hell's gap gaping below.  You're only saying it. You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the windpipe of a screeching sow.  You're not speaking the truth.  Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?  Don't strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the like of that.  Is it killed your father?  With the help of God I did surely, and that the Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.  There's a daring fellow.  Oh, glory be to God!  That was a hanging crime, mister honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.  He was a dirty man, God forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up with him at all.  And you shot him dead?  I never used weapons. I've no license, and I'm a law-fearing man.  It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world it's bloody knives they use.  Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?  You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers swearing it had life?
EN092	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$'Not I.'  'Young gentlemen, how disgraceful!'  'Harum-scarums!'  'Does he know about you two?'  'He often forgets, I'll tell him again. Grandfather, Barbara and I have something to say to you. It's this.'  'I know--I know. There's nothing like it. I'm very glad, Barbara.'  'You see, dear, I've loved Billy boy since the days when he tried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I held on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at school at marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroom had always to take the name of Billy. "Do you, woman, take this man Billy--" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answer diffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, "I should rather think she does."'  'Don't forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldn't find the ring!'  'Were you married here, sir?'  'Yes, at the village church.'  'So were my father and mother.'  'I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some of the furniture.'  'I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?'  'No, just the same.'  'I hoped you would say that.'  'But, Billy, I'm to have such a dream of a wedding gown. Granny is going with me to London, to choose it'--laying her head on the Colonel's shoulder--'if you can do without her for a day, dear.'  'I shall go with you, I couldn't trust you and granny to choose the gown.'  'You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out and about enjoying ourselves.'  'They all say that. But that is the time when I'm not lonely, Karl. It's then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It all comes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and it's so real, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to see them; I don't know they haven't been here, Billy, till your granny tells me afterwards.' 'Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.'  'It isn't often she leaves you for so long, dear.'  'She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes, she has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'A wedding?'  'It's curious how he harps on that.'  'She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.'  'Not to-day, dear.'  'Best not to worry him.'  'But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.'  'Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?'  'You were there, Barbara.'  'No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.'  'She was there, too.'  'Any one else?'  'There was that soldier.'  'A soldier also!'  'Just those three.'  'But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.'  'They were all there; but there were only three.'  'Odd.'  'Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right. She is the one for you.'  'She is the one for me.'  'If there had been a wedding, wouldn't she have taken the Colonel with her?'  'Of course she would.'  'You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.'  'Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, very likely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on their wedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are all pretty on their wedding day.' 'You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!'  'Yes, I have; yes, I have!'  'I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to you about Billy boy and me, and you haven't been able to wait; you have hurried on the wedding!'  'Bravo, Barbara, you've got it.'  'That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.'  'Our wedding, Billy!'  'It doesn't explain those other people, though.'  'What is it, dear?'  'I can't quite remember, but I think that is why she didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy is to be there, my love.'  'Not at my wedding!'  'Grandfather!'  'There's something sad about it.'  'There can't be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Granny didn't say it was a sad wedding, did she?'  'She was smiling.'  'Of course she was.'  'But I think that was only to please the nurse.'  'That nurse again! Dear, don't think any more about it. There's no wedding.'  'Is there not?'  'I told you! There is a wedding!'  'It's Barbara's wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbara's wedding?'
EN154	0	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.
EN155	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day!

You that pretend to be plucky! I won't have it, you know. You get your pipe, and look slippy about it.'  'Yes, Dick, Now, then, burn your thumb with the match--you always did, you know. That's the style. You've forgotten to cock your head to the side. Not so bad. That's you. Like it?'  'It's rather nice, Dick. Dick, you and me by the fire!'  'Yes, but sit still. How often we might have been like this, father, and weren't.'  'Ah!'  'Face. How is Fido?'  'Never a dog missed her master more.'  'Oh, She doesn't want to go and sit on my grave, or any of that tosh, does she? As if I were there!'  'No, no, she goes ratting, Dick.'  'Good old Fido!'  'Dick, here's a good one.

Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?
EN157	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ.

Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho!

But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right.

Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee Peter Pan.  I am that. Here's the little, fat body. And here's the four legs. I'll just stick the legs on with nails--and there he stands. Now, here's a little potato for a head, and an ould skinny carrot for a trunk. I'll stick them on with a hair pin. Now, I'll stick on the ears and put in the shoe-button eyes, and with this wee bit of black paper for a tailpiece, and there ye are. Mr. Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan as natural as life and twice as handsome.  Here's a doll baby I've dressed, but it's no head she has at all, at all.  Use a big yellow apple or a wee yellow punkin, and put on a baby cap--and there ye are. Stick in some buttons for eyes, and a wee nose and mouth of red paper--and stick the head on the body with some hair pins, and the quane herself niver had a better doll baby.  I'll put her right here on the table alongside of the iliphant.  It's nine o'clock, it is. Isn't it time for the children to be home?  It is that. And here they come now.  The Mulligans are coming now, as happy as can be, We've been to the Sunday School and saw the Christmas tree, Had a lark with Santa Claus and take a tip from me, We'll all be marching on Christmas!  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here, Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year, And we'll be marching on Christmas!  Patsy got a trumpet, little Micky got a drum, Matsy got a spinning top, you ought to hear it hum, Clarissa got a candy cane, oh, won't we have the fun, When we are marching on Christmas!  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here,
EN098	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$'Not I.'  'Young gentlemen, how disgraceful!'  'Harum-scarums!'  'Does he know about you two?'  'He often forgets, I'll tell him again. Grandfather, Barbara and I have something to say to you. It's this.'  'I know--I know. There's nothing like it. I'm very glad, Barbara.'  'You see, dear, I've loved Billy boy since the days when he tried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I held on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at school at marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroom had always to take the name of Billy. "Do you, woman, take this man Billy--" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answer diffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, "I should rather think she does."'  'Don't forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldn't find the ring!'  'Were you married here, sir?'  'Yes, at the village church.'  'So were my father and mother.'  'I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some of the furniture.'  'I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?'  'No, just the same.'  'I hoped you would say that.'  'But, Billy, I'm to have such a dream of a wedding gown. Granny is going with me to London, to choose it'--laying her head on the Colonel's shoulder--'if you can do without her for a day, dear.'  'I shall go with you, I couldn't trust you and granny to choose the gown.'  'You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out and about enjoying ourselves.'  'They all say that. But that is the time when I'm not lonely, Karl. It's then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It all comes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and it's so real, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to see them; I don't know they haven't been here, Billy, till your granny tells me afterwards.' 'Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.'  'It isn't often she leaves you for so long, dear.'  'She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes, she has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'A wedding?'  'It's curious how he harps on that.'  'She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.'  'Not to-day, dear.'  'Best not to worry him.'  'But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.'  'Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?'  'You were there, Barbara.'  'No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.'  'She was there, too.'  'Any one else?'  'There was that soldier.'  'A soldier also!'  'Just those three.'  'But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.'  'They were all there; but there were only three.'  'Odd.'  'Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right. She is the one for you.'  'She is the one for me.'  'If there had been a wedding, wouldn't she have taken the Colonel with her?'  'Of course she would.'  'You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.'  'Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, very likely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on their wedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are all pretty on their wedding day.' 'You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!'  'Yes, I have; yes, I have!'  'I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to you about Billy boy and me, and you haven't been able to wait; you have hurried on the wedding!'  'Bravo, Barbara, you've got it.'  'That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.'  'Our wedding, Billy!'  'It doesn't explain those other people, though.'  'What is it, dear?'  'I can't quite remember, but I think that is why she didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy is to be there, my love.'  'Not at my wedding!'  'Grandfather!'  'There's something sad about it.'  'There can't be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Granny didn't say it was a sad wedding, did she?'  'She was smiling.'  'Of course she was.'  'But I think that was only to please the nurse.'  'That nurse again! Dear, don't think any more about it. There's no wedding.'  'Is there not?'  'I told you! There is a wedding!'  'It's Barbara's wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbara's wedding?'
EN152	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$'Did you? I should have liked to see that. I have often oiled their bats for them. Careless lads, they always forget. Was that nice German boy with him?'  'Mr. Karl? Not far off, sir. He was sitting by the bank of the stream playing on his flute; and Miss Barbara, she had climbed one of my apple-trees,--she says they are your trees.'  'They are, you know, Dering,'  'Yes, sir, in a sense, but I don't like any of you to meddle with them. And there she sat, pelting the two of them with green apples.'  'How like her! I don't know how we are to make a demure young lady of her.'  'They say in the village, sir, that Master Will would like to try.'  'Ha! ha! he is just a colt himself. Who are all here now, Dering; in the house, I mean? I sometimes forget. They grow old so quickly. They go out at one door in the bloom of youth, and come back by another, tired and grey. Haven't you noticed it?'  'No, sir. The only visitors staying here are Miss Barbara and Mr. Karl. There's just them and yourselves, sir, you and the mistress and Master Will. That's all.'  'Yes, that's all,' his master says, still unconvinced. 'Who is the soldier, Dering?'  'Soldier, sir? There is no soldier here except yourself.'  'Isn't there? There was a nurse with him. Who is ill?'  'No one, sir. There's no nurse.' Dering backs away from the old man. Would you like me to call the mistress, sir?'  'No, she has gone down to the village. She told me why, but I forget. Miss Barbara is with her.'  'Miss Barbara is down by the stream, sir.'  'Is she? I think they said they were going to a wedding. Who is being married to-day, Dering?'  'I have heard of no wedding, sir. But here is Miss Barbara.'  'Here's the tomboy!'  'Dering, I believe you are complaining to the Colonel about my watering the flowers at the wrong time of day.''Aha! Aha!'  'I did just mention it, miss.'  'You horrid! Dear, don't mind him. And every time he says they are his flowers and his apples, you tell me, and I shall say to his face that they are yours.'  'The courage of those young things!'  'Let me make you comfy--the way granny does it.'  'That is not quite the way she does it, Do you call her granny, Barbara?'  'She asked me to--for practice. Don't you remember why?'  'I know! Billy boy.'  'You are quick today. Now, wait till I get your cane.'  'I don't need my cane while I'm sitting.'  'You look so beau'ful, sitting holding your cane. Oh dear! I am a clumsy.'  Not at all, but perhaps if I were to do it for myself. That's better. Thank you, Barbara, very much.'  'I didn't do it. I'm all thumbs. What a ghastly nurse I should make.'  'Nurse? Who is she, Barbara?'  'Who is who, dear?'  'That nurse.'  'There's no nurse here.'  'Isn't there?'  'Where is granny?'  'She has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'There's no wedding. Who could be being married?'  'I think it's people I know, but I can't remember who they are. I thought you went too, Barbara.'  'Not I. Catch me missing it if there had been a wedding!'  'You and the nurse.'  'Dear, you have just been imagining things again. Shall I play to you, or sing? Oh dear, everything catches in me. Would you like me to "Robin Adair," dear?'  'No, thank you, Barbara. Barbara, the house seems so empty. Where are Billy and Karl?'  'Billy is where Karl is, you may be sure.'  'And where is Karl?'  'He is where Billy boy is, you may be sure.'  'And where are they both?'  'Not far from where Barbara is, you bet. Do you hear Karl's flute? They have been down all the morning at the pool where the alder is, trying to catch that bull-trout.'  'They didn't get him, I'll swear!'  'You can ask them.'  'I spent a lot of my youth trying to get that bull-trout. I tumbled in there sixty years ago.'  'I tumbled in sixty minutes ago! It can't be the same trout, dear.'  'Same old rascal!'  'You muddy things!'  'Did you get the bull-trout, Billy boy?'  'He's a brute that.'  'He is, you know.'  BILLY. 'He came up several times and had a look at my fly. Didn't flick it, or do anything as complimentary as that. Just yawned and went down.'  COLONEL. 'Yawned, did he? Used to wink in my time. Did you and Billy fish at Heidelberg, Karl?'  KARL. 'We were more worthily employed, sir, but we did unbend at times. Billy, do you remember--' He begins a gay dance.

We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold.  Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.  God rest his soul.  Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.  The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.  I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.  Thank you kindly, lady of the house.  Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.  I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.  Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?  There's no offence, lady of the house?  No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all?
EN277	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$He's a hog on two legs.  You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.
EN179	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$For every one, etc.  Sing high, sing low, Wherever they go, They all shall equal be!  Then hail! O King, Whichever you may be, To you we sing, But do not bend the knee. Then hail! O King.    Come, let's away--our island crown awaits me-- Conflicting feelings rend my soul apart! The thought of Royal dignity elates me, But leaving thee behind me breaks my heart!    Farewell, my love; on board you must be getting; But while upon the sea you gaily roam, Remember that a heart for thee is fretting-- The tender little heart you've left at home!  Now, Marco dear, My wishes hear: While you're away It's understood You will be good And not too gay. To every trace Of maiden grace You will be blind, And will not glance By any chance On womankind!  If you are wise, You'll shut your eyes Till we arrive, And not address A lady less Than forty-five. You'll please to frown On every gown That you may see; And, O my pet, You won't forget You've married me!  And O my darling, O my pet, Whatever else you may forget, In yonder isle beyond the sea, Do not forget you've married me!  You'll lay your head Upon your bed At set of sun. You will not sing Of anything To any one. You'll sit and mope All day, I hope, And shed a tear Upon the life Your little wife Is passing here.  And if so be You think of me, Please tell the moon! I'll read it all In rays that fall On the lagoon: You'll be so kind As tell the wind How you may be, And send me words By little birds To comfort me!
EN323	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road, and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.  Providence and Mercy, spare us all!  It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.  I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?  The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.  Well, you should have been a queer lot. I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more years of age.  Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a Tuesday and halve his skull.  Well, you'll have peace in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.  It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in me and bravery of...  Oh, glory! it's late for knocking, and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.
EN322	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$You stick to me, Brocky, and I'll pull you through.  Monsieur Fleury.  The chef.  Very charmed to see you, Monsieur Fleury.  Thank you very much.  Agatha--recitation!  Mr. Rolleston.

Your hand, Gladys.  Tweeny.  So happy to see you.  John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce me.  That's an uncommon pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.  No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.  They are not all here, Crichton.  Odds and ends. Which is to recite?  And how are all at home?  Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?  No, no, the family. How's the baby?  Blooming, your lordship.  A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice little fellow.  Beg pardon, my lord, it's a girl.  A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.  Very delighted to see you, Crichton.  Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?  Milk and sugar, Crichton?  I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.  To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful. Oh, please do speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?  It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.  I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.  I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.  Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything?  I have no idea, my lady.  But you laughed.  My lady, he is the second son of a peer.  Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.

EN320	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned. Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?  What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
EN327	0	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a sheep.  It's true the Lord God formed you to contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?  Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?  Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her pigsty and not plague us here.  I'm going; but he'll come with me.  Are you dumb, young fellow?  God increase you; but I'm pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.  Now you have heard him, and go on from this.  It's lonesome this hour crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.  Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will send you now.  Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.  What's that she's after saying?
EN326	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.  Is it dead he is or living?  It's little you care if it's dead or living I am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead. Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half in your skin.
EN325	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.
EN324	1	She hasn't come yet, is it, and it falling to the night?  She has not. . . It's dark with the clouds are coming from the west and south, but it isn't later than the common.  It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not. Would you have him see you, and he a man would be jealous of a hawk would fly between her and the rising sun.

Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain.

We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.
EN329	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Then I run, and I run, and I run, till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain
EN328	0	I'll do it, Annie--for your sake--if you say it's needful for ye.  God bless you for that, David!  The ice is breakin' up to no'the'ard, sir. There's a clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond, the lookout says.  A clear passage? To no'the'ard?  Yes, sir.  Then get her ready and we'll drive her through.  Aye, aye, sir.  David! David!  Will the men turn to willin' or must we drag 'em out?  They'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God into 'em, sir. They're meek as lambs.  KEENEY. Then drive 'em--both watches. [_With grim determination._] They's whale t'other side o' this floe and we're agoin' to git 'em.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir.  And I was agoin' home like a yaller dog!  David!  Woman, you ain't adoin' right when you meddle in men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I got to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in. I got to git the ile, I tell ye. David! Aren't you going home?  You ain't well. Go and lay down a mite. I got to git on deck.  David!  Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? Annie! What is it? Don't you know me, Annie?  You said--you was agoin' mad--God!  Whales, sir--a whole school of 'em--off the star-b'd quarter 'bout five miles away--big ones!  Are you lowerin' the boats?  MATE. Yes, sir.  I'm acomin' with ye.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir. You'll git the ile now right enough, sir.  Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git the ile. [I know you're foolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind--be you? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while longer, Annie--then we'll turn home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?  All ready, sir.  Comin', sir?$$$'Not I.'  'Young gentlemen, how disgraceful!'  'Harum-scarums!'  'Does he know about you two?'  'He often forgets, I'll tell him again. Grandfather, Barbara and I have something to say to you. It's this.'  'I know--I know. There's nothing like it. I'm very glad, Barbara.'  'You see, dear, I've loved Billy boy since the days when he tried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I held on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at school at marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroom had always to take the name of Billy. "Do you, woman, take this man Billy--" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answer diffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, "I should rather think she does."'  'Don't forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldn't find the ring!'  'Were you married here, sir?'  'Yes, at the village church.'  'So were my father and mother.'  'I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some of the furniture.'  'I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?'  'No, just the same.'  'I hoped you would say that.'  'But, Billy, I'm to have such a dream of a wedding gown. Granny is going with me to London, to choose it'--laying her head on the Colonel's shoulder--'if you can do without her for a day, dear.'  'I shall go with you, I couldn't trust you and granny to choose the gown.'  'You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out and about enjoying ourselves.'  'They all say that. But that is the time when I'm not lonely, Karl. It's then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It all comes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and it's so real, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to see them; I don't know they haven't been here, Billy, till your granny tells me afterwards.' 'Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.'  'It isn't often she leaves you for so long, dear.'  'She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes, she has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'A wedding?'  'It's curious how he harps on that.'  'She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.'  'Not to-day, dear.'  'Best not to worry him.'  'But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.'  'Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?'  'You were there, Barbara.'  'No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.'  'She was there, too.'  'Any one else?'  'There was that soldier.'  'A soldier also!'  'Just those three.'  'But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.'  'They were all there; but there were only three.'  'Odd.'  'Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right. She is the one for you.'  'She is the one for me.'  'If there had been a wedding, wouldn't she have taken the Colonel with her?'  'Of course she would.'  'You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.'  'Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, very likely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on their wedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are all pretty on their wedding day.' 'You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!'  'Yes, I have; yes, I have!'  'I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to you about Billy boy and me, and you haven't been able to wait; you have hurried on the wedding!'  'Bravo, Barbara, you've got it.'  'That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.'  'Our wedding, Billy!'  'It doesn't explain those other people, though.'  'What is it, dear?'  'I can't quite remember, but I think that is why she didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy is to be there, my love.'  'Not at my wedding!'  'Grandfather!'  'There's something sad about it.'  'There can't be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Granny didn't say it was a sad wedding, did she?'  'She was smiling.'  'Of course she was.'  'But I think that was only to please the nurse.'  'That nurse again! Dear, don't think any more about it. There's no wedding.'  'Is there not?'  'I told you! There is a wedding!'  'It's Barbara's wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbara's wedding?'
EN129	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a sheep.  It's true the Lord God formed you to contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?  Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?  Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her pigsty and not plague us here.  I'm going; but he'll come with me.  Are you dumb, young fellow?  God increase you; but I'm pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.  Now you have heard him, and go on from this.  It's lonesome this hour crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.  Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will send you now.  Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.  What's that she's after saying?
EN128	1	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN446	1	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with me.  And where is he now?  Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.  Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay for Mrs. O'Toole.  I can't drink any tay. I'm that injured I can't drink at all, at all.  A drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.  Yis, mum.  I was out in me cabbage garden picking a bit of cabbage for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water. And I'm almost killed entirely--and it's all the fault of your goat, Mrs. Mulligan.  There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things easy.  I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan. Sure I'm thinking I'll be after spindin' the rist of me life standing up on me two fate.  So the goat struck ye, did he?  He did.  My, my, the trouble I've had all along of that Shamus O'Brien. He's an awful goat, is Shamus O'Brien.   Here's the tea, mum.  Thank ye kindly, Bridget. Here, Kathleen, take a cup of tay and let it soothe your wounded feelings.  Sure, it's more than me feelings that is wounded, Mrs. Mulligan.  Maw, ain't it time we were starting for the entertainment?  My, my, I've been that excited about the misdeeds of that rascal Shamus O'Brien that I had forgotten the Christmas entertainment entirely.  Sure, your family looks as though they were going out in society, Mollie Mulligan.  hey are that. They're on their way to the fine church entertainment at the Sunday School down the strate.  Maw, here comes Matsy with the goat.  Matsy Mulligan, tie that goat in the back yard and tie all his four fate together. I'll tach him a lesson, if it's the last thing I ever do. Patsy, go out and help your brother tie up Shamus O'Brien.
EN447	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$'That's better,'  'I think I'll go to my room now. You will come up, mater?'  'Yes, dear. I shan't be five minutes, John.'  'More like half an hour.'  'There is nothing wrong, is there? I thought I noticed a--a----'  'A certain liveliness, my dear. No, we were only having a good talk.'  'What about, John?'  'About the war,'  'About tactics and strategy, wasn't it, Roger?'  'Yes.'  'The fact is, Ellen, I have been helping Roger to take his first trench.' With a big breath, 'And we took it too, together, didn't we, Roger?'  'You bet,'  'Though I suppose,' sighing, 'it is one of those trenches that the enemy retake during the night.'  'Oh, I--I don't know, father.'  'Whatever are you two talking about?'  'Aha, it is very private. We don't tell you everything, you know, Ellen.'  'Come on, mater, it's only his beastly sarcasm again. 'Night, father; I won't see you in the morning.'  ''Night,'  'Good-night, dear father.'  'A beautiful morning, Dering.'  'Too much sun, sir. The roses be complaining, and, to make matters worse, Miss Barbara has been watering of them--in the heat of the day.'  'Has she? She means well. Dering, you heard it, didn't you?'  'What was that, sir?'  'The thunderstorm--early this morning.'  'There was no thunderstorm, sir.'  'That is what they all say. It was at four o'clock. I got up and looked out at the window. The evening primroses were very beautiful.'  'I don't hold much with evening primroses, sir; but I was out and about at four; there was no thunderstorm.'  'I suppose I just thought there was one. Perhaps it was some thunderstorm of long ago that I heard. They do come back, you know.'  'Do they, sir?'  'I am glad to see you moving about in the garden, Dering, with everything just as usual.'  'Thank you, sir.'  'No, don't go. I am--a little troubled, Dering.'  'Everything be all right, sir.'  'I'm glad of that,' the Colonel says with relief. 'It is pleasant to see that you have come back, Dering. Why did you go away for such a long time?'  'Me, sir?' Dering is a little aggrieved. 'I haven't had a day off since Christmas.'  'Haven't you? I thought--'  'Is everything just as usual, Dering?'  'Yes, sir. There never were a place less changed than this.'  'That's true.' The Colonel is appeased. 'Thank you, Dering, for saying that.' But next moment he has lowered his voice again. 'Dering, there is nothing wrong, is there? Is anything happening that I am not being told about?'  'Not that I know of, sir.'  'That is what they all say, but--I don't know. Dering, I feel as if I was needed somewhere. I don't know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is every one?'  'They're all about, sir. There's a cricket match on at the village green.'  'Is there?'  'If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices. You were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.'  'Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggest score I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred, but I wouldn't let them. I was pretty good at steering them through the slips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didn't matter where point stood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.'  'That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snap you regular at point.'  'Did he? I daresay he did. I can't play now, but I like to watch it still.' 'Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I don't understand it, Dering. When I got there the green was all dotted with them--it's the prettiest sight and sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, one and two at a time; they weren't given out, you know, they went as if they had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--and then they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps were left lying about. Why is it?'  'It's just fancy, sir, I saw Master Will oiling his bat yesterday.'
EN112	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother. I was just like her when I was that age.  And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.  Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I think the show is about to begin. Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical! Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical!

He arrived last week by parcel post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife.

I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$If we did, my lady, the first thing we should do would be to elect a head. Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?

He's original in that opinion.  I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.
EN443	0	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night.  You should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and Spain.  We were great surely, with wide and windy acres of rich Munster land.  Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?  Is it me?  Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?  I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in the naked parish where I grew a man.  If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking, and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.  I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't fearing you at all.  You've said the like of that, maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.  I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine prancing women making laughter with the men.  If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.  You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you single now?  What would I want wedding so young?  We're alike, so.
EN440	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?  Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big, tall little girl.  A great, big tall little girl, hey?  And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.  Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?  And so do I.  And so do you, hey?  Yes, sir; that is our wish.  Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.  You said you could give us anything we wished for.  But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine. Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll see what I can do for you.

On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--

Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?

Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.  What's that she's after saying?
EN127	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$A bloody-handed murderer the like of...  Whisht I am saying; we'll take no fooling from your like at all.And you, young fellow, you'd have a right to stop, I'm thinking, for we'd do our all and utmost to content your needs.  And I'd be safe in this place from the searching law?  You would, surely. If they're not fearing you, itself, the peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows, wouldn't touch a cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night.  Let you stop a short while anyhow. Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.  It's a nice room, and if it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.  Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door, and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk at the wake.  And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?  Christopher Mahon.  Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.  God bless you all.  God bless you.  Are you wanting me to stop along with you and keep you from harm?  Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?  There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it too.  You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step off nimble this time when there's none.  Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...  Go on, then, to Father Reilly, and let him put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.  If I meet the Widow Quin...  Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your noise. That lad would wear the spirits from the saints of peace. timidly. Then she comes to him and speaks with bland good-humour.) Let you stretch out now by the fire, young fellow. You should be destroyed travelling.
EN119	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'

It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN448	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold.  Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.  God rest his soul.  Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.  The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.  I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.  Thank you kindly, lady of the house.  Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.  I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.  Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?  There's no offence, lady of the house?  No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all?
EN449	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all the same mopin' and lazin' in it. It's the bad luck I've been havin' altogether this last year since your mother died. Who's to do the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. hat a fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a millionaire! Mary, dear, it's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most. What are you sniffin' at?  I was thinking--of Mamma.  It's late you are with your tears, and her cold in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!  Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself?  Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I beat him.  Slow poke!  You didn't beat me, neither!  I did, too!  You did not! You didn't play fair. You tripped me comin' up the steps. Brick-top! Cheater!  You're a liar! You stumbled over your own big feet, clumsy bones! And I beat you fair Didn't I, Papa?  You did, darlin', and fair, too. Sure it's you can beat the divil himself!  See? Liar!  Did you get the plug for me I told you?
EN110	1	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN111	1	I'll do it, Annie--for your sake--if you say it's needful for ye.  God bless you for that, David!  The ice is breakin' up to no'the'ard, sir. There's a clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond, the lookout says.  A clear passage? To no'the'ard?  Yes, sir.  Then get her ready and we'll drive her through.  Aye, aye, sir.  David! David!  Will the men turn to willin' or must we drag 'em out?  They'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God into 'em, sir. They're meek as lambs.  KEENEY. Then drive 'em--both watches. [_With grim determination._] They's whale t'other side o' this floe and we're agoin' to git 'em.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir.  And I was agoin' home like a yaller dog!  David!

I got to git the ile, I tell ye. David! Aren't you going home?  You ain't well. Go and lay down a mite. I got to git on deck.  David!  Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? Annie! What is it? Don't you know me, Annie?  You said--you was agoin' mad--God!  Whales, sir--a whole school of 'em--off the star-b'd quarter 'bout five miles away--big ones!  Are you lowerin' the boats?  MATE.

You ain't out of your mind--be you? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while longer, Annie--then we'll turn home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?  All ready, sir.  Comin', sir?$$$He's a hog on two legs.  You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.
EN299	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.

And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."
EN114	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$A bloody-handed murderer the like of...  Whisht I am saying; we'll take no fooling from your like at all.And you, young fellow, you'd have a right to stop, I'm thinking, for we'd do our all and utmost to content your needs.  And I'd be safe in this place from the searching law?  You would, surely. If they're not fearing you, itself, the peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows, wouldn't touch a cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night.  Let you stop a short while anyhow. Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.  It's a nice room, and if it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.  Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door, and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk at the wake.  And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?  Christopher Mahon.  Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.  God bless you all.  God bless you.  Are you wanting me to stop along with you and keep you from harm?  Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?  There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it too.  You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step off nimble this time when there's none.  Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...  Go on, then, to Father Reilly, and let him put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.  If I meet the Widow Quin...  Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your noise. That lad would wear the spirits from the saints of peace. timidly. Then she comes to him and speaks with bland good-humour.) Let you stretch out now by the fire, young fellow. You should be destroyed travelling.
EN115	1	She hasn't come yet, is it, and it falling to the night?  She has not. . . It's dark with the clouds are coming from the west and south, but it isn't later than the common.  It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not. Would you have him see you, and he a man would be jealous of a hawk would fly between her and the rising sun.

There'll be trouble this night, for he should be in his tempers from the way he's stepping out, and he swinging his hands.  wearied with the whole matter. -- It'd be best of all, maybe, if he got in tempers with herself, and made an end quickly, for I'm in a poor way between the pair of them. There they are now at the door.  The gods save you.  getting up and courtesy-ing. -- The gods save and keep you kindly, and stand between you and all harm for ever.  Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  Bring them out and use them from this day.  We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor. All say there isn't her match at fancying figures and throwing purple upon crimson, and she edging them all times with her greens and gold.  a little uneasily. -- Is she keeping wise and busy since I passed before, and growing ready for her life in Emain?  dryly. -- That is a question will give small pleasure to yourself or me. If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$Then I run, and I run, and I run, till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain

But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?  Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big, tall little girl.  A great, big tall little girl, hey?  And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.  Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?  And so do I.  And so do you, hey?  Yes, sir; that is our wish.  Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.  You said you could give us anything we wished for.  But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine. Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll see what I can do for you.

Hail, little One, so dear, My heart is full of cheer, A little ball I bring, Reach forth thy fingers gay, And take the ball and play, My blessed King. I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings, And here a scepter full of gems, For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!   And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    The greatest gift is yet ungiven, The gift that cometh straight from Heaven. O, Heavenly King, Heart's love we bring.   Not gold nor gems from land or sea Is worth the love we offer Thee.

EN291	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was courting each other just like the rest of yeez.  Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.  Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at him?  Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez are. Will you look at the red color in his face?  If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.  Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's a fine girl, if I do say it myself.  Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain to spake her piece.  LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.

Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$That's five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It's not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke, and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good.  What was it you got?  Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.  Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....  Son of God deliver us.  Now you'll not marry her the time I'm rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.
EN297	0	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'

We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?

I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?  All ready, sir.  Comin', sir?$$$Sure.  It's a great wonder you didn't forget it--and me without a chew.  Ouch! Darn you!  Shut your big mouth! What is the matter with you at all?  She pinched me--hard as she could, too--and look at her laughin'!  Cry-baby! I owed you one.  I'll fix you. I'll tell Eileen, wait 'n' see!  Tattle-tale! I don't care. Eileen's sick.  That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get even, you bet!  Shut up your noise! Go up to bed, the two of you, and no more talk, and you go with them, Mary.  Come on, Mary. Wake up.  Ow!  Hush your noise, you soft, weak thing, you! It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the time. I'll have a moment's peace, I will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!  Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?  No. The doctor's with her yet. Yes, go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
EN294	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother.

EN024	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN025	1	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother. I was just like her when I was that age.  And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.  Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I think the show is about to begin. Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical! Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical! Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks! Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks! Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled, Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld, The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man, Aerial Artists from far-off Japan, Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun, Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!  Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old, to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcel post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife.
EN026	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve.

EN027	0	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$He's a hog on two legs.  You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.
EN020	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Six yards of stuff for to make a yellow gown. A pair of lace boots with lengthy heels on them and brassy eyes. A hat is suited for a wedding-day. A fine tooth comb. To be sent with three barrels of porter in Jimmy Farrell's creel cart on the evening of the coming Fair to Mister Michael James Flaherty. With the best compliments of this season. Margaret Flaherty.  Where's himself?  He's coming. To Mister Sheamus Mulroy, Wine and Spirit Dealer, Castlebar.  I didn't see him on the road.  How would you see him and is dark night this half hour gone by?  I stood a while outside wondering would I have a right to pass on or to walk in and see you,  and I could hear the cows breathing, and sighing in the stillness of the air, and not a step moving any place from this gate to the bridge.  It's above at the cross-roads he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him to Kate Cassidy's wake.  And he's going that length in the dark night?  He is surely, and leaving me lonesome on the scruff of the hill. Isn't it long the nights are now, Shawn Keogh, to be leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of day?  If it is, when we're wedded in a short while you'll have no call to complain, for I've little will to be walking off to wakes or weddings in the darkness of the night.  You're making mighty certain, Shaneen, that I'll wed you now.  Aren't we after making a good bargain, the way we're only waiting these days on Father Reilly's dispensation from the bishops, or the Court of Rome.

You need it, I guess.$$$The tide, Crichton, is a postman who calls at our island twice a day for letters.  Thank you, sir.  Poor Crichton! I sometimes think he is losing his sense of humour. Come along, Agatha.  How horribly still it is.  It is best when it is still.  Mary, I have heard that they are always very still just before they jump.  Don't.  It is only Crichton knocking down trees.  Mary, let us go and stand beside him.  Let a servant see that I am afraid!  Don't, then; but remember this, dear, they often drop on one from above.  Crichton, Crichton!  Did you call, my lady?  I! Why should I?  I made a mistake, your ladyship. If you are afraid of being alone, my lady--  Afraid! Certainly not. You may go.  I wish, Crichton, you could work without getting so hot.  I wish I could, my lady.  It makes me hot to look at you.  It almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship.  Anything I can do for you in that way, Crichton, I shall do with pleasure.  Thank you, my lady.  Don't give way, my lady, things might be worse.  My poor father.  If I could have given my life for his.  You did all a man could do. Indeed I thank you, Crichton. You are a man.  Thank you, my lady.  But it is all so awful. Crichton, is there any hope of a ship coming?  Of course there is, my lady.  Don't treat me as a child. I have got to know the worst, and to face it. Crichton, the truth.  We were driven out of our course, my lady; I fear far from the track of commerce.  Thank you; I understand.  You're a good pluckt 'un, my lady.  I shall try to be. Crichton, how dare you?  I beg your ladyship's pardon; but you are.  And until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for you ladies.  Mr. Ernest does no work.  But he will, my lady.  I doubt it.  No work--no dinner--will make a great change in Mr. Ernest.  No work--no dinner. When did you invent that rule, Crichton?  I didn't invent it, my lady. I seem to see it growing all over the island.  Crichton, your manner strikes me as curious.  I hope not, your ladyship.  You are not implying anything so unnatural, I presume, as that if I and my sisters don't work there will be no dinner for us?  If it is unnatural, my lady, that is the end of it.  If? Now I understand. The perfect servant at home holds that we are all equal now. I see.  My lady, can you think me so inconsistent?  That is it.  My lady, I disbelieved in equality at home because it was against nature, and for that same reason I as utterly disbelieve in it on an island.  I apologise.  There must always, my lady, be one to command and others to obey.  One to command, others to obey. Yes. Crichton!  What is it, my lady?  Look what I found.  Cocoa-nuts. Bravo!  They grows on trees.  Where did you think they grew?  I thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks.
EN189	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$'That's better,'  'I think I'll go to my room now. You will come up, mater?'  'Yes, dear. I shan't be five minutes, John.'  'More like half an hour.'  'There is nothing wrong, is there? I thought I noticed a--a----'  'A certain liveliness, my dear. No, we were only having a good talk.'  'What about, John?'  'About the war,'  'About tactics and strategy, wasn't it, Roger?'  'Yes.'  'The fact is, Ellen, I have been helping Roger to take his first trench.' With a big breath, 'And we took it too, together, didn't we, Roger?'  'You bet,'  'Though I suppose,' sighing, 'it is one of those trenches that the enemy retake during the night.'  'Oh, I--I don't know, father.'  'Whatever are you two talking about?'  'Aha, it is very private. We don't tell you everything, you know, Ellen.'  'Come on, mater, it's only his beastly sarcasm again. 'Night, father; I won't see you in the morning.'  ''Night,'  'Good-night, dear father.'  'A beautiful morning, Dering.'  'Too much sun, sir. The roses be complaining, and, to make matters worse, Miss Barbara has been watering of them--in the heat of the day.'  'Has she? She means well. Dering, you heard it, didn't you?'  'What was that, sir?'  'The thunderstorm--early this morning.'  'There was no thunderstorm, sir.'  'That is what they all say. It was at four o'clock. I got up and looked out at the window. The evening primroses were very beautiful.'  'I don't hold much with evening primroses, sir; but I was out and about at four; there was no thunderstorm.'  'I suppose I just thought there was one. Perhaps it was some thunderstorm of long ago that I heard. They do come back, you know.'  'Do they, sir?'  'I am glad to see you moving about in the garden, Dering, with everything just as usual.'  'Thank you, sir.'  'No, don't go. I am--a little troubled, Dering.'  'Everything be all right, sir.'  'I'm glad of that,' the Colonel says with relief. 'It is pleasant to see that you have come back, Dering. Why did you go away for such a long time?'  'Me, sir?' Dering is a little aggrieved. 'I haven't had a day off since Christmas.'  'Haven't you? I thought--'  'Is everything just as usual, Dering?'  'Yes, sir. There never were a place less changed than this.'  'That's true.' The Colonel is appeased. 'Thank you, Dering, for saying that.' But next moment he has lowered his voice again. 'Dering, there is nothing wrong, is there? Is anything happening that I am not being told about?'  'Not that I know of, sir.'  'That is what they all say, but--I don't know. Dering, I feel as if I was needed somewhere. I don't know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is every one?'  'They're all about, sir. There's a cricket match on at the village green.'  'Is there?'  'If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices. You were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.'  'Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggest score I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred, but I wouldn't let them. I was pretty good at steering them through the slips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didn't matter where point stood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.'  'That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snap you regular at point.'  'Did he? I daresay he did. I can't play now, but I like to watch it still.' 'Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I don't understand it, Dering. When I got there the green was all dotted with them--it's the prettiest sight and sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, one and two at a time; they weren't given out, you know, they went as if they had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--and then they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps were left lying about. Why is it?'  'It's just fancy, sir, I saw Master Will oiling his bat yesterday.'
EN188	1	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do.

Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with me.  And where is he now?  Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.  Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay for Mrs. O'Toole.  I can't drink any tay. I'm that injured I can't drink at all, at all.  A drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.  Yis, mum.  I was out in me cabbage garden picking a bit of cabbage for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water. And I'm almost killed entirely--and it's all the fault of your goat, Mrs. Mulligan.  There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things easy.  I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan. Sure I'm thinking I'll be after spindin' the rist of me life standing up on me two fate.  So the goat struck ye, did he?  He did.  My, my, the trouble I've had all along of that Shamus O'Brien.

Patsy, go out and help your brother tie up Shamus O'Brien.
EN187	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Sure.  It's a great wonder you didn't forget it--and me without a chew.  Ouch! Darn you!  Shut your big mouth! What is the matter with you at all?  She pinched me--hard as she could, too--and look at her laughin'!  Cry-baby! I owed you one.  I'll fix you. I'll tell Eileen, wait 'n' see!  Tattle-tale! I don't care. Eileen's sick.  That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get even, you bet!  Shut up your noise! Go up to bed, the two of you, and no more talk, and you go with them, Mary.  Come on, Mary. Wake up.  Ow!  Hush your noise, you soft, weak thing, you! It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the time. I'll have a moment's peace, I will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!  Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?  No. The doctor's with her yet. Yes, go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
EN186	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$Oh Tweeny, Tweeny!  Have I offended of your feelings again, sir?  A little.  I'm full o' vulgar words and ways; and though I may keep them in their holes when you are by, as soon as I'm by myself out they comes in a rush like beetles when the house is dark. I says them gloating-like, in my head--'Blooming' I says, and 'All my eye,' and 'Ginger,' and 'Nothink'; and all the time we was being wrecked I was praying to myself, 'Please the Lord it may be an island as it's natural to be vulgar on.'  That's the kind I am, sir. I'm 'opeless. You'd better give me up.  I won't give you up. It is strange that one so common should attract one so fastidious; but so it is. There is something about you, Tweeny, there is a je ne sais quoi about you.  Is there, is there? Oh, I am glad.  We shall fight your vulgarity together. (All this time he has been arranging sticks for his fire.) Now get some dry grass. (She brings him grass, and he puts it under the sticks. He produces an odd lens from his pocket, and tries to focus the sun's rays.)  Why, what's that?  That's the glass from my watch and one from Mr. Treherne's, with a little water between them. I'm hoping to kindle a fire with it.  Oh sir!  Danger! Crichton, a tiger-cat!  Where?  It is at our heels.  Look out, Crichton.  H'sh!  It will be on us in a moment. Listen!  The grass is moving. It's coming.  Father.  Mary--Catherine--Agatha. Oh dear, my dears, my dears, oh dear!  Darling.  Sweetest.  Love.  Glad to see you, sir.  Uncle, uncle, dear old uncle.  Ernest thought you were a tiger-cat.  Oh, did you? I knew you at once, Ernest; I knew you by the way you ran.  My lord, I am glad.  But you are also idling, Crichton. We mustn't waste time. To work, to work.  Yes, sir.  Ernest, you be a little more civil. Crichton, let me help.  Is that--but I suppose I'm dreaming again. It isn't by any chance a pot on top of a fire, is it?  Indeed, it is, dearest. It is our supper.  I have been dreaming of a pot on a fire for two days. There 's nothing in it, is there?  Sniff, uncle.  It smells of onions!  Father, you have boots!  So he has.  Of course I have.  You are actually wearing boots, uncle. It's very unsafe, you know, in this climate.  Is it?  We have all abandoned them, you observe. The blood, the arteries, you know.  I hadn't a notion.  O Lord, yes.  Father, he is trying to get your boots from you. There is nothing in the world we wouldn't give for boots.  I only wanted the loan of them.  If you lend them to any one, it will be to us, won't it, father.  Certainly, my child.  Oh, very well. I don't want your old boots. You don't think you could spare me one boot?  I do not.  Quite so. Well, all I can say is I'm sorry for you.  Father, we thought we should never see you again.  I was washed ashore, my dear, clinging to a hencoop. How awful that first night was.  Poor father.  When I woke, I wept. Then I began to feel extremely hungry. There was a large turtle on the beach. I remembered from the Swiss Family Robinson that if you turn a turtle over he is helpless. My dears, I crawled towards him, I flung myself upon him the nasty, spiteful brute.
EN185	1	Gawd, I can't stand this! I better beat it.  Well, who's the blond?  Dat vas Anna, Larry.  Your daughter, Anna?  Don't you tank she vas pooty gel, Larry?  Sure! A peach!  You bet you! Give me drink for take back--one port vine for Anna--she calabrate dis one time with me--and small beer for me.  Small beer for you, eh? She's reformin' you already.  You bet! You look tired, Anna. Veil, Ay make you take good long rest now. Come, you drink vine. It put new life in you. Skoal, Anna! You know dat Svedish word?  Skoal! Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!       Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$Humph! He's original in that opinion.  I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.
EN184	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$In the regrettable slang of the servants' hall, my lady, the master is usually referred to as the Gov.  I see. You--  Yes, I understand that is what they call me.  You didn't even take your meals with the family?  No, my lady, I dined apart.  You, girl, also? Did you dine with Crichton?  No, your ladyship.  With whom?  I took my bit of supper with--with Daddy and Polly and the rest.  Dear old Daddy--he was our monkey. You remember our monkey, Agatha?  Rather! What a funny old darling he was.  And don't you think Polly was the sweetest little parrot, Mary?  Ah! I understand; animals you had domesticated?  Quite so--quite so.  The servants' teas that used to take place here once a month--  They did not seem natural on the island, my lady, and were discontinued by the Gov.'s orders.  A clear proof, Loam, that they were a mistake here.  I admit it frankly. I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I think of going over to the Tories.  I am delighted to hear it.  Thank you, Crichton, thank you; that is all.  One moment. Young people, Crichton, will be young people, even on an island; now, I suppose there was a certain amount of--shall we say sentimentalising, going on? Yes, my lady, there was.  Mother!  Which gentleman? You, girl, tell me.  If you please, my lady--  The fact is--  It was him--Mr. Ernest, your ladyship.  With which lady?  I have already told you, Lady Brocklehurst, that Ernest and I--  Yes, now; but you were two years on the island. Was it this lady?  No, your ladyship.  Then I don't care which of the others it was. Well, I suppose that will do.  Do! I hope you are ashamed of yourself, mother. You are an excellent fellow, Crichton; and if, after we are married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.  Oh no, impossible--  Why impossible? Do you see why it should be impossible, my man?  Yes, my lady. I had not told you, my lord, but as soon as your lordship is suited I wish to leave service.  What will you do, Crichton?  Shall I withdraw, my lord?  Horrid of me, wasn't it? But if one wasn't disagreeable now and again, it would be horribly tedious to be an old woman. He will soon be yours, Mary, and then--think of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to me. On that understanding, my dear, don't you think we might--?  Quite so--quite so. To wish you every dear happiness.  The same to you, my lady.  Do you despise me, Crichton? You are the best man among us.  On an island, my lady, perhaps; but in England, no.  Then there's something wrong with England.  My lady, not even from you can I listen to a word against England.  Tell me one thing: you have not lost your courage?  No, my lady.
EN183	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?

I'm thinking it's myself will be wheezing that time with lying down under the Heavens when the night is cold; but you've a fine bit of talk, stranger, and it's with yourself I'll go.  You think it's a grand thing you're after doing with your letting on to be dead, but what is it at all? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this place, and she not making a talk with the men passing? And what way will yourself live from this day, with none to care for you? What is it you'll have now but a black life, Daniel Burke, and it's not long I'm telling you, till you'll be lying again under that sheet, and you dead surely.  Sit down now and take a little taste of the stuff, Micheal Dara. There's a great drouth on me, and the night is young.  And it's very dry I am, surely, with the fear of death you put on me, and I after driving mountain ewes since the turn of the day.  I was thinking to strike you, Micheal Dara, but you're a quiet man, God help you, and I don't mind you at all.  Your good health, Micheal Dara.  God reward you, Daniel Burke, and may you have a long life, and a quiet life, and good health with it.
EN181	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$For every one, etc.  Sing high, sing low, Wherever they go, They all shall equal be!  Then hail! O King, Whichever you may be, To you we sing, But do not bend the knee. Then hail! O King.    Come, let's away--our island crown awaits me-- Conflicting feelings rend my soul apart! The thought of Royal dignity elates me, But leaving thee behind me breaks my heart!    Farewell, my love; on board you must be getting; But while upon the sea you gaily roam, Remember that a heart for thee is fretting-- The tender little heart you've left at home!  Now, Marco dear, My wishes hear: While you're away It's understood You will be good And not too gay. To every trace Of maiden grace You will be blind, And will not glance By any chance On womankind!  If you are wise, You'll shut your eyes Till we arrive, And not address A lady less Than forty-five. You'll please to frown On every gown That you may see; And, O my pet, You won't forget You've married me!  And O my darling, O my pet, Whatever else you may forget, In yonder isle beyond the sea, Do not forget you've married me!  You'll lay your head Upon your bed At set of sun. You will not sing Of anything To any one. You'll sit and mope All day, I hope, And shed a tear Upon the life Your little wife Is passing here.  And if so be You think of me, Please tell the moon! I'll read it all In rays that fall On the lagoon: You'll be so kind As tell the wind How you may be, And send me words By little birds To comfort me!

It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....

EN367	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$'That movement again! Don't you want me to go on?'  'Let us stop.'  'Not unless he wishes it. Why are those words so important? Does the message end there? Is any one working against you? Some one antagonistic? Yes. Not one of ourselves surely? No. Is it any one we know? Yes. Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of this person's name A?--B?----'  'Is the second letter A?'  'FA. Fa----?'  'Is the word Father? Yes.'  'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'  'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'  'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly antagonistic, is he?'  'I am afraid he is.'  'But he must admit that we do get messages.'  'He says we think we do. He says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'  'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'  'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'  'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'  'He said it was.'  'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'  'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't thinking of it at all.'  'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'  'I'll go.'  'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'  'As to that--as to that----'  'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'  'No, don't.'  'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'  'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'  'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'  'You see, Dick and I were not very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'  'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'  'I'll go.'  'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'  'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'  'No, no, don't.'  'It would be all right, Don.'  'I don't know.'  'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel I--should like to be alone.'  'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'  'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening. I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'  'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather not. Thanks, awfully.'  'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'  'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'  'Dick's fishing-rods.'  'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'  'That's all right, Grace.'  'I think I shall go to Laura now.'  'Yes,'  'Poor child!'  'I'm afraid I hurt her.'  'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'  'Why not, Grace?'  'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father.'  'I daresay.'  'How you can read about the war nowadays!'  'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's just that I can't believe in it.'  'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was to me.'  'I don't know.'  'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'

Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$You stick to me, Brocky, and I'll pull you through.  Monsieur Fleury.  The chef.  Very charmed to see you, Monsieur Fleury.  Thank you very much.  Agatha--recitation!  Mr. Rolleston.  How do you do, Rolleston?  Mr. Tompsett.  Miss Fisher.  This is a pleasure, Miss Fisher.  If I might venture, Miss Fisher  Miss Simmons.  You are always welcome, Miss Simmons.  At last we meet. Won't you sit down?  Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Charmed to see you, Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Mr. Treherne, this is Fisher, my maid.  Your what, Mary?  My friend. Thomas.  How do you do, Thomas?  John.  How do you do, John?  Brocklehurst, this is John. I think you have already met on the door-step.  Jane.  Give me your hand, Jane.  Gladys.  How do you do, Gladys. You know my uncle?  Your hand, Gladys.  Tweeny.  So happy to see you.  John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce me.  That's an uncommon pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.  No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.  They are not all here, Crichton.  Odds and ends. Which is to recite?  And how are all at home?  Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?  No, no, the family. How's the baby?  Blooming, your lordship.  A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice little fellow.  Beg pardon, my lord, it's a girl.  A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.  Very delighted to see you, Crichton.  Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?  Milk and sugar, Crichton?  I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.  To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful. Oh, please do speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?  It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.  I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.  I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.  Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything?  I have no idea, my lady.  But you laughed.  My lady, he is the second son of a peer.  Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.
EN365	0	Then you think the sea's to blame for everything, eh? Well, you're still workin' on it, ain't you, spite of all you used to write me about hating it. That dame was here told me you was captain of a coal barge--and you wrote me you was yanitor of a building!  Oh, Ay work on land long time as yanitor. Yust short time ago Ay got dis yob cause Ay vas sick, need open air.  Sick? You? You'd never think it.  And, Anna, dis ain't real sailor yob. Dis ain't real boat on sea.

Ay keep my word, py yingo!  Well, I can't see no difference. Speaking of being sick, I been there myself--yust out of the hospital two weeks ago.  You, Anna? Py golly! You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?  Anna, Ay like see you like hell, Ay tal you! And don't you talk no more about gatting yob. You stay with me. Ay don't see you for long time, you don't forgat dat. Ay'm gatting ole. Ay gat no one in vorld but you.  Thanks. It sounds good to hear someone--talk to me that way. Say, though--if you're so lonely--it's funny--why ain't you ever married again?  Ay love your mo'der too much for ever do dat, Anna.$$$Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold.  Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.  God rest his soul.  Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.  The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.  I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.  Thank you kindly, lady of the house.  Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.  I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.  Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?  There's no offence, lady of the house?  No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all?
EN364	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$I'll take off anything else in reason.  But a Royal Salute to my daughter--it costs so little.  Papa, I don't want a salute.

EN363	0	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$I'll take off anything else in reason.  But a Royal Salute to my daughter--it costs so little.  Papa, I don't want a salute.

EN361	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$I never married with one, let alone with a couple or three.  Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn. Were you off east, young fellow, fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the Boers?  I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week.  He's done nothing, so. If you didn't commit murder or a bad, nasty thing, or false coining, or robbery, or butchery, or the like of them, there isn't anything that would be worth your troubling for to run from now. You did nothing at all.  That's an unkindly thing to be saying to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging before, and hell's gap gaping below.  You're only saying it. You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the windpipe of a screeching sow.  You're not speaking the truth.  Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?  Don't strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the like of that.  Is it killed your father?  With the help of God I did surely, and that the Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.  There's a daring fellow.  Oh, glory be to God!  That was a hanging crime, mister honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.  He was a dirty man, God forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up with him at all.  And you shot him dead?  I never used weapons. I've no license, and I'm a law-fearing man.  It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world it's bloody knives they use.  Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?  You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers swearing it had life?

The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself?

Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  Bring them out and use them from this day.  We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$That's five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It's not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke, and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good.  What was it you got?  Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.  Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....  Son of God deliver us.  Now you'll not marry her the time I'm rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.

Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Of the child that is born, O Baltasar, I begged a woman to tell us the news; I said in the east we had seen His star, And had ridden fast and had ridden far To find and worship the King of the Jews.  Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star Is standing still over this lowly hut.  Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!  What ho, within!  Sirs, whom seek ye?   We have journeyed from afar Led by the shining of yon splendid star. We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.   We seek a new-born King, Gold, frankincense to him we bring. And many a kingly offering.  Behold, the child is clothed in light!   Our journey ends, passed is the night.   Now let us make no more delay, But worship Him right worthily.   Hail, hail, dear child Of a maiden meek and mild. See, he merries! See, he smiles, my sweeting, I give thee greeting! Have a bob of cherries.   Hail, little One we've sought, See, a bird I've brought, See its feathers gay. Hail, little One adored, Hail, blessed King and Lord, Star of the day!   Hail, little One, so dear, My heart is full of cheer, A little ball I bring, Reach forth thy fingers gay, And take the ball and play, My blessed King. I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings, And here a scepter full of gems, For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!   And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    The greatest gift is yet ungiven, The gift that cometh straight from Heaven. O, Heavenly King, Heart's love we bring.   Not gold nor gems from land or sea Is worth the love we offer Thee.   And lowly folk who have no gold, Nor gift to offer that is meet, May bring the dearest thing of all-- A loving heart and service sweet.
EN368	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$A bloody-handed murderer the like of...  Whisht I am saying; we'll take no fooling from your like at all.And you, young fellow, you'd have a right to stop, I'm thinking, for we'd do our all and utmost to content your needs.  And I'd be safe in this place from the searching law?  You would, surely. If they're not fearing you, itself, the peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows, wouldn't touch a cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night.  Let you stop a short while anyhow. Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.  It's a nice room, and if it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.  Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door, and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk at the wake.  And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?  Christopher Mahon.  Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.  God bless you all.  God bless you.  Are you wanting me to stop along with you and keep you from harm?  Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?  There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it too.  You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step off nimble this time when there's none.  Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...  Go on, then, to Father Reilly, and let him put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.  If I meet the Widow Quin...  Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your noise. That lad would wear the spirits from the saints of peace. timidly. Then she comes to him and speaks with bland good-humour.) Let you stretch out now by the fire, young fellow. You should be destroyed travelling.

Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.

But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book.

Sit down here.$$$I never killed my father. I'd be afeard to do that, except I was the like of yourself with blind rages tearing me within, for I'm thinking you should have had great tussling when the end was come.  We had not then. It was a hard woman was come over the hill, and if he was always a crusty kind when he'd a hard woman setting him on, not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up with him at all.  And isn't it a great wonder that one wasn't fearing you?  Up to the day I killed my father, there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no man giving me heed.  It was the girls were giving you heed maybe, and I'm thinking it's most conceit you'd have to be gaming with their like.  Not the girls itself, and I won't tell you a lie. There wasn't anyone heeding me in that place saving only the dumb beasts of the field.  And I thinking you should have been living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world.  The like of a king, is it? And I after toiling, moiling, digging, dodging from the dawn till dusk with never a sight of joy or sport saving only when I'd be abroad in the dark night poaching rabbits on hills, for I was a devil to poach, God forgive me, and I near got six months for going with a dung fork and stabbing a fish.  And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?  I did, God help me, and there I'd be as happy as the sunshine of St. Martin's Day, watching the light passing the north or the patches of fog, till I'd hear a rabbit starting to screech and I'd go running in the furze.

We have journeyed from afar Led by the shining of yon splendid star. We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.   We seek a new-born King, Gold, frankincense to him we bring. And many a kingly offering.  Behold, the child is clothed in light!   Our journey ends, passed is the night.   Now let us make no more delay, But worship Him right worthily.   Hail, hail, dear child Of a maiden meek and mild. See, he merries! See, he smiles, my sweeting, I give thee greeting! Have a bob of cherries.   Hail, little One we've sought, See, a bird I've brought, See its feathers gay. Hail, little One adored, Hail, blessed King and Lord, Star of the day!   Hail, little One, so dear, My heart is full of cheer, A little ball I bring, Reach forth thy fingers gay, And take the ball and play, My blessed King. I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings, And here a scepter full of gems, For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!   And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    The greatest gift is yet ungiven, The gift that cometh straight from Heaven. O, Heavenly King, Heart's love we bring.   Not gold nor gems from land or sea Is worth the love we offer Thee.   And lowly folk who have no gold, Nor gift to offer that is meet, May bring the dearest thing of all-- A loving heart and service sweet.
EN208	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.
EN209	0	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$'That movement again! Don't you want me to go on?'  'Let us stop.'  'Not unless he wishes it. Why are those words so important? Does the message end there? Is any one working against you? Some one antagonistic? Yes. Not one of ourselves surely? No. Is it any one we know? Yes. Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of this person's name A?--B?----'  'Is the second letter A?'  'FA. Fa----?'  'Is the word Father? Yes.'  'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'  'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'  'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly antagonistic, is he?'  'I am afraid he is.'  'But he must admit that we do get messages.'  'He says we think we do. He says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'  'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'  'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'  'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'  'He said it was.'  'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'  'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't thinking of it at all.'  'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'  'I'll go.'  'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'  'As to that--as to that----'  'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'  'No, don't.'  'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'  'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'  'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'  'You see, Dick and I were not very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'  'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'  'I'll go.'  'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'  'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'  'No, no, don't.'  'It would be all right, Don.'  'I don't know.'  'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel I--should like to be alone.'  'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'  'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening. I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'  'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather not. Thanks, awfully.'  'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'  'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'  'Dick's fishing-rods.'  'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'  'That's all right, Grace.'  'I think I shall go to Laura now.'  'Yes,'  'Poor child!'  'I'm afraid I hurt her.'  'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'  'Why not, Grace?'  'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father.'  'I daresay.'  'How you can read about the war nowadays!'  'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's just that I can't believe in it.'  'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was to me.'  'I don't know.'  'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'
EN163	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$I perceive, from the tea cups, Crichton, that the great function is to take place here.  Yes, sir.  The servants' hall coming up to have tea in the drawing-room! No wonder you look happy, Crichton.  No, sir.  Do you know, Crichton, I think that with an effort you might look even happier. You don't approve of his lordship's compelling his servants to be his equals--once a month?  It is not for me, sir, to disapprove of his lordship's radical views.  Certainly not. And, after all, it is only once a month that he is affable to you.  On all other days of the month, sir, his lordship's treatment of us is everything that could be desired. Tea cups!

Suppose you were all little fishes at the bottom of the sea  And how are my little friends to-day?  Don't be silly, Ernest. If you want to know how we are, we are dead. Even to think of entertaining the servants is so exhausting.  Besides which, we have had to decide what frocks to take with us on the yacht, and that is such a mental strain.  You poor over-worked things. Rest your weary limbs.  But why have you a footstool in your hand?  Yes?  Why? You see, as the servants are to be the guests I must be butler. I was practising. This is a tray, observe.  Tea, my lady? It is only you, Ernest; I thought there was some one here.  Had a very tiring day also, Mary?  Dreadfully. Been trying on engagement-rings all the morning.  What's that? Is it Brocklehurst?  You have given your warm young heart to Brocky?  I don't wish to fatigue you, Mary, by insisting on a verbal answer, but if, without straining yourself, you can signify Yes or No, won't you make the effort?  The ring! Then I am too late, too late! (Fixing LADY MARY sternly, like a prosecuting counsel.) May I ask, Mary, does Brocky know? Of course, it was that terrible mother of his who pulled this through. Mother does everything for Brocky. Still, in the eyes of the law you will be, not her wife, but his, and, therefore, I hold that Brocky ought to be informed. Now--  If you girls are shamming sleep in the expectation that I shall awaken you in the manner beloved of ladies, abandon all such hopes.  You impertinent boy.

EN162	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Who's there?  Me.  Who's me?  The Widow Quin.  Go on now with your supper, and let on to be sleepy, for if she found you were such a warrant to talk, she'd be stringing gabble till the dawn of day.  What ails you, or what is it you're wanting at this hour of the night?  I'm after meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below, who told me of your curiosity man, and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring, romping on your hands with drink.  Look now is he roaring, and he stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk. Walk down and tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh.  I'll not see them again, for I've their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me.  This night, is it?  This night. "It isn't fitting," says the priesteen, "to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl."  God save you, mister!  God save you kindly.  Well, aren't you a little smiling fellow? It should have been great and bitter torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood.  It should, maybe.  It's more than "maybe" I'm saying, and it'd soften my heart to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake, and you fitter to be saying your catechism than slaying your da.  There's talking when any'd see he's fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world. Walk on from this, for I'll not have him tormented and he destroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week.  We'll be walking surely when his supper's done, and you'll find we're great company, young fellow, when it's of the like of you and me you'd hear the penny poets singing in an August Fair.  Did you kill your father?  She did not. She hit himself with a worn pick, and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never overed it, and died after. That was a sneaky kind of murder did win small glory with the boys itself.

'Young gentlemen, how disgraceful!'  'Harum-scarums!'  'Does he know about you two?'  'He often forgets, I'll tell him again. Grandfather, Barbara and I have something to say to you. It's this.'  'I know--I know. There's nothing like it. I'm very glad, Barbara.'  'You see, dear, I've loved Billy boy since the days when he tried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I held on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at school at marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroom had always to take the name of Billy. "Do you, woman, take this man Billy--" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answer diffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, "I should rather think she does."'  'Don't forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldn't find the ring!'  'Were you married here, sir?'  'Yes, at the village church.'  'So were my father and mother.'  'I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some of the furniture.'  'I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?'  'No, just the same.'  'I hoped you would say that.'  'But, Billy, I'm to have such a dream of a wedding gown. Granny is going with me to London, to choose it'--laying her head on the Colonel's shoulder--'if you can do without her for a day, dear.'  'I shall go with you, I couldn't trust you and granny to choose the gown.'  'You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out and about enjoying ourselves.'  'They all say that. But that is the time when I'm not lonely, Karl. It's then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It all comes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and it's so real, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to see them; I don't know they haven't been here, Billy, till your granny tells me afterwards.' 'Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.'  'It isn't often she leaves you for so long, dear.'  'She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes, she has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'A wedding?'  'It's curious how he harps on that.'  'She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.'  'Not to-day, dear.'  'Best not to worry him.'  'But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.'  'Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?'  'You were there, Barbara.'  'No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.'  'She was there, too.'  'Any one else?'  'There was that soldier.'  'A soldier also!'  'Just those three.'  'But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.'  'They were all there; but there were only three.'  'Odd.'  'Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right. She is the one for you.'  'She is the one for me.'  'If there had been a wedding, wouldn't she have taken the Colonel with her?'  'Of course she would.'  'You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.'  'Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, very likely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on their wedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are all pretty on their wedding day.' 'You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!'  'Yes, I have; yes, I have!'  'I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to you about Billy boy and me, and you haven't been able to wait; you have hurried on the wedding!'  'Bravo, Barbara, you've got it.'  'That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.'  'Our wedding, Billy!'  'It doesn't explain those other people, though.'  'What is it, dear?'  'I can't quite remember, but I think that is why she didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy is to be there, my love.'  'Not at my wedding!'  'Grandfather!'  'There's something sad about it.'  'There can't be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Granny didn't say it was a sad wedding, did she?'  'She was smiling.'  'Of course she was.'

'It's Barbara's wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbara's wedding?'

Woman, you ain't adoin' right when you meddle in men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I got to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in. I got to git the ile, I tell ye. David! Aren't you going home?  You ain't well. Go and lay down a mite. I got to git on deck.  David!  Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? Annie! What is it? Don't you know me, Annie?  You said--you was agoin' mad--God!  Whales, sir--a whole school of 'em--off the star-b'd quarter 'bout five miles away--big ones!  Are you lowerin' the boats?  MATE. Yes, sir.  I'm acomin' with ye.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir. You'll git the ile now right enough, sir.  Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git the ile. [I know you're foolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind--be you? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while longer, Annie--then we'll turn home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?  All ready, sir.  Comin', sir?$$$I perceive, from the tea cups, Crichton, that the great function is to take place here.  Yes, sir.  The servants' hall coming up to have tea in the drawing-room! No wonder you look happy, Crichton.  No, sir.  Do you know, Crichton, I think that with an effort you might look even happier. You don't approve of his lordship's compelling his servants to be his equals--once a month?  It is not for me, sir, to disapprove of his lordship's radical views.  Certainly not. And, after all, it is only once a month that he is affable to you.  On all other days of the month, sir, his lordship's treatment of us is everything that could be desired. Tea cups! Life, Crichton, is like a cup of tea; the more heartily we drink, the sooner we reach the dregs.  Thank you, sir.  as we do when we have need of an ally). Crichton, in case I should be asked to say a few words to the servants, I have strung together a little speech. I was wondering where I should stand.  with the best intentions, gives him a footstool to stand on, and departs, happily unconscious that ERNEST in some dudgeon has kicked the footstool across the room.)  Suppose you were all little fishes at the bottom of the sea  And how are my little friends to-day?  Don't be silly, Ernest. If you want to know how we are, we are dead. Even to think of entertaining the servants is so exhausting.  Besides which, we have had to decide what frocks to take with us on the yacht, and that is such a mental strain.  You poor over-worked things. Rest your weary limbs.  But why have you a footstool in your hand?  Yes?  Why? You see, as the servants are to be the guests I must be butler. I was practising. This is a tray, observe.  Tea, my lady? It is only you, Ernest; I thought there was some one here.  Had a very tiring day also, Mary?  Dreadfully. Been trying on engagement-rings all the morning.  What's that? Is it Brocklehurst?  You have given your warm young heart to Brocky?  I don't wish to fatigue you, Mary, by insisting on a verbal answer, but if, without straining yourself, you can signify Yes or No, won't you make the effort?  The ring! Then I am too late, too late! (Fixing LADY MARY sternly, like a prosecuting counsel.) May I ask, Mary, does Brocky know? Of course, it was that terrible mother of his who pulled this through. Mother does everything for Brocky. Still, in the eyes of the law you will be, not her wife, but his, and, therefore, I hold that Brocky ought to be informed. Now--  If you girls are shamming sleep in the expectation that I shall awaken you in the manner beloved of ladies, abandon all such hopes.  You impertinent boy.

EN206	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$'Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things to do: and you, too, Barbara. They are leaving in an hour, John.'  'If you would like to take Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the garden.'  'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'  'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'  'But there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'  'Let me, dear,'  'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'  'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is. There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew, he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go to the alder pool, Barbara.'  'We won't go there, dear.'  'Did I do all right, Ellen?'  'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'  'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion! I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'  'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to you; you like that, don't you?'  'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No, I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'  'Barbara?'  'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'  'Which bit shall I read?'  'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.' 'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun to laugh already.'  'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'  'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish? Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'  'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'  'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'  'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but something prevents him.'  'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'  'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better. Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'  'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little light?'  'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it helps one to concentrate.'   'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you still there?'  'I think I felt a movement.'  'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'  'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'  'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'  'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'  'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'  'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with A?--with B? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the fourth word Welcome? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me Welcome.'
EN207	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$'That's better,'  'I think I'll go to my room now. You will come up, mater?'  'Yes, dear. I shan't be five minutes, John.'  'More like half an hour.'  'There is nothing wrong, is there? I thought I noticed a--a----'  'A certain liveliness, my dear. No, we were only having a good talk.'  'What about, John?'  'About the war,'  'About tactics and strategy, wasn't it, Roger?'  'Yes.'  'The fact is, Ellen, I have been helping Roger to take his first trench.' With a big breath, 'And we took it too, together, didn't we, Roger?'  'You bet,'  'Though I suppose,' sighing, 'it is one of those trenches that the enemy retake during the night.'  'Oh, I--I don't know, father.'  'Whatever are you two talking about?'  'Aha, it is very private. We don't tell you everything, you know, Ellen.'  'Come on, mater, it's only his beastly sarcasm again. 'Night, father; I won't see you in the morning.'  ''Night,'  'Good-night, dear father.'  'A beautiful morning, Dering.'  'Too much sun, sir. The roses be complaining, and, to make matters worse, Miss Barbara has been watering of them--in the heat of the day.'  'Has she? She means well. Dering, you heard it, didn't you?'  'What was that, sir?'  'The thunderstorm--early this morning.'  'There was no thunderstorm, sir.'  'That is what they all say. It was at four o'clock. I got up and looked out at the window. The evening primroses were very beautiful.'  'I don't hold much with evening primroses, sir; but I was out and about at four; there was no thunderstorm.'  'I suppose I just thought there was one. Perhaps it was some thunderstorm of long ago that I heard. They do come back, you know.'  'Do they, sir?'  'I am glad to see you moving about in the garden, Dering, with everything just as usual.'  'Thank you, sir.'  'No, don't go. I am--a little troubled, Dering.'  'Everything be all right, sir.'  'I'm glad of that,' the Colonel says with relief. 'It is pleasant to see that you have come back, Dering. Why did you go away for such a long time?'  'Me, sir?' Dering is a little aggrieved. 'I haven't had a day off since Christmas.'  'Haven't you? I thought--'  'Is everything just as usual, Dering?'  'Yes, sir. There never were a place less changed than this.'  'That's true.' The Colonel is appeased. 'Thank you, Dering, for saying that.' But next moment he has lowered his voice again. 'Dering, there is nothing wrong, is there? Is anything happening that I am not being told about?'  'Not that I know of, sir.'  'That is what they all say, but--I don't know. Dering, I feel as if I was needed somewhere. I don't know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is every one?'  'They're all about, sir. There's a cricket match on at the village green.'  'Is there?'  'If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices. You were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.'  'Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggest score I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred, but I wouldn't let them. I was pretty good at steering them through the slips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didn't matter where point stood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.'  'That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snap you regular at point.'  'Did he? I daresay he did. I can't play now, but I like to watch it still.' 'Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I don't understand it, Dering. When I got there the green was all dotted with them--it's the prettiest sight and sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, one and two at a time; they weren't given out, you know, they went as if they had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--and then they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps were left lying about. Why is it?'  'It's just fancy, sir, I saw Master Will oiling his bat yesterday.'

Now, as the country is in a state of insurrection, it is absolutely necessary that you should assume the reins of Government at once; and, until it is ascertained which of you is to be king, I have arranged that you will reign jointly, so that no question can arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts.  As one individual?  As one individual.  Like this?  Something like that.  And we may take our friends with us, and give them places about the Court?  Undoubtedly. That's always done!  I'm convinced!  So am I!  Then the sooner we're off the better.  We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)--  Stop, stop--that won't do at all--ladies are not admitted.  What!  Not admitted. Not at present. Afterwards, perhaps. We'll see.  Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate us from our wives!  This is very awkward! Only for a time--a few months. Alter all, what is a few months?  But we've only been married half an hour!   Kind sir, you cannot have the heart Our lives to part From those to whom an hour ago We were united! Before our flowing hopes you stem, Ah, look at them, And pause before you deal this blow, All uninvited! You men can never understand That heart and hand Cannot be separated when We go a-yearning; You see, you've only women's eyes To idolize And only women's hearts, poor men, To set you burning! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!  Some kind of charm you seem to find In womankind-- Some source of unexplained delight (Unless you're jesting), But what attracts you, I confess, I cannot guess, To me a woman's face is quite Uninteresting! If from my sister I were torn, It could be borne-- I should, no doubt, be horrified, But I could bear it;-- But Marco's quite another thing-- He is my King, He has my heart and none beside Shall ever share it! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!
EN201	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.

I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'
EN203	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."
EN401	0	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$In the regrettable slang of the servants' hall, my lady, the master is usually referred to as the Gov.  I see. You--  Yes, I understand that is what they call me.  You didn't even take your meals with the family?  No, my lady, I dined apart.  You, girl, also? Did you dine with Crichton?  No, your ladyship.  With whom?  I took my bit of supper with--with Daddy and Polly and the rest.  Dear old Daddy--he was our monkey. You remember our monkey, Agatha?  Rather! What a funny old darling he was.  And don't you think Polly was the sweetest little parrot, Mary?  Ah! I understand; animals you had domesticated?  Quite so--quite so.  The servants' teas that used to take place here once a month--  They did not seem natural on the island, my lady, and were discontinued by the Gov.'s orders.  A clear proof, Loam, that they were a mistake here.  I admit it frankly. I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I think of going over to the Tories.  I am delighted to hear it.  Thank you, Crichton, thank you; that is all.  One moment. Young people, Crichton, will be young people, even on an island; now, I suppose there was a certain amount of--shall we say sentimentalising, going on? Yes, my lady, there was.  Mother!  Which gentleman? You, girl, tell me.  If you please, my lady--  The fact is--  It was him--Mr. Ernest, your ladyship.  With which lady?  I have already told you, Lady Brocklehurst, that Ernest and I--  Yes, now; but you were two years on the island. Was it this lady?  No, your ladyship.  Then I don't care which of the others it was. Well, I suppose that will do.  Do! I hope you are ashamed of yourself, mother. You are an excellent fellow, Crichton; and if, after we are married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.  Oh no, impossible--  Why impossible? Do you see why it should be impossible, my man?  Yes, my lady. I had not told you, my lord, but as soon as your lordship is suited I wish to leave service.  What will you do, Crichton?  Shall I withdraw, my lord?  Horrid of me, wasn't it? But if one wasn't disagreeable now and again, it would be horribly tedious to be an old woman. He will soon be yours, Mary, and then--think of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to me. On that understanding, my dear, don't you think we might--?  Quite so--quite so. To wish you every dear happiness.  The same to you, my lady.  Do you despise me, Crichton? You are the best man among us.  On an island, my lady, perhaps; but in England, no.  Then there's something wrong with England.  My lady, not even from you can I listen to a word against England.  Tell me one thing: you have not lost your courage?  No, my lady.
EN407	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Come along with me now, lady of the house, and it's not my blather you'll be hearing only, but you'll be hearing the herons crying out over the black lakes, and you'll be hearing the grouse and the owls with them, and the larks and the big thrushes when the days are warm, and it's not from the like of them you'll be hearing a talk of getting old like Peggy Cavanagh, and losing the hair off you, and the light of your eyes, but it's fine songs you'll be hearing when the sun goes up, and there'll be no old fellow wheezing, the like of a sick sheep, close to your ear.  I'm thinking it's myself will be wheezing that time with lying down under the Heavens when the night is cold; but you've a fine bit of talk, stranger, and it's with yourself I'll go.  You think it's a grand thing you're after doing with your letting on to be dead, but what is it at all? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this place, and she not making a talk with the men passing? And what way will yourself live from this day, with none to care for you? What is it you'll have now but a black life, Daniel Burke, and it's not long I'm telling you, till you'll be lying again under that sheet, and you dead surely.  Sit down now and take a little taste of the stuff, Micheal Dara. There's a great drouth on me, and the night is young.  And it's very dry I am, surely, with the fear of death you put on me, and I after driving mountain ewes since the turn of the day.  I was thinking to strike you, Micheal Dara, but you're a quiet man, God help you, and I don't mind you at all.  Your good health, Micheal Dara.  God reward you, Daniel Burke, and may you have a long life, and a quiet life, and good health with it.
EN022	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$If we did, my lady, the first thing we should do would be to elect a head. Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?
EN023	0	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso.

Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap.

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself.

Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have surely.  We'll be going now, lady of the house--the rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning by the grace of God.

You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house, and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold, and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking on each day, and it passing you by.

EN029	0	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$Sure.  It's a great wonder you didn't forget it--and me without a chew.  Ouch! Darn you!  Shut your big mouth! What is the matter with you at all?  She pinched me--hard as she could, too--and look at her laughin'!  Cry-baby! I owed you one.  I'll fix you. I'll tell Eileen, wait 'n' see!  Tattle-tale! I don't care. Eileen's sick.  That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get even, you bet!  Shut up your noise! Go up to bed, the two of you, and no more talk, and you go with them, Mary.  Come on, Mary. Wake up.  Ow!  Hush your noise, you soft, weak thing, you! It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the time. I'll have a moment's peace, I will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!  Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?  No. The doctor's with her yet. Yes, go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
EN338	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$'Yes, perhaps.'  'Good-night, Robert.'  'Good-night, dear.'  'Dick!'  'I have come to sit with you for a bit, father.'  'It's you, Dick; it's you!'  'It's me all right, father. I say, don't be startled, or anything of that kind. We don't like that.'  'My boy!'  'How am I looking, father?'  'You haven't altered, Dick.'  'Rather not. It's jolly to see the old studio again! I say, father, don't fuss. Let us be our ordinary selves, won't you?'  'I'll try, I'll try. You didn't say you had come to sit with me, Dick? Not with me!'  'Rather!'  'But your mother----'  'It's you I want.'  'Me?'  'We can only come to one, you see.'  'Then why me?'  'That's the reason. Hello, here's your old jacket, greasier than ever!'  'Me? But, Dick, it is as if you had forgotten. It was your mother who was everything to you. It can't be you if you have forgotten that. I used to feel so out of it; but, of course, you didn't know.'  'I didn't know it till lately, father; but heaps of things that I didn't know once are clear to me now. I didn't know that you were the one who would miss me most; but I know now.'  'Me miss you most? Dick, I try to paint just as before. I go to the club. Dick, I have been to a dinner-party. I said I wouldn't give in.'  'We like that.'  'But, my boy----'  'I say, father, let's get away from that sort of thing.'  'That is so like you, Dick! I'll do anything you ask.'  'Then keep a bright face.'  'I've tried to.'  'Good man! I say, put on your old greasy; you are looking so beastly clean.'  'Anything you like. No, that's the wrong sleeve. Thanks, Dick.'  'Here, let me shove you into your old seat.'  'How's that, umpire!'  'Dick, that's just how you used to butt me into it long ago!'  'When I was a kid.'  'With the palette in my hand.'  'Or sticking to your trousers.'  'The mess we made of ourselves, Dick.' 'I sneaked behind the settle and climbed up it.'  'Till you fell off.'  'On top of you and the palette.'  'Ah, Dick.'  'Now then, behave! What did I say about that face?'  'That's better. I'll sit here.'  'Got your pipe?'  'I don't--I don't seem to care to smoke nowadays, Dick.'  'Rot! Just because I am dead! You that pretend to be plucky! I won't have it, you know. You get your pipe, and look slippy about it.'  'Yes, Dick, Now, then, burn your thumb with the match--you always did, you know. That's the style. You've forgotten to cock your head to the side. Not so bad. That's you. Like it?'  'It's rather nice, Dick. Dick, you and me by the fire!'  'Yes, but sit still. How often we might have been like this, father, and weren't.'  'Ah!'  'Face. How is Fido?'  'Never a dog missed her master more.'  'Oh, She doesn't want to go and sit on my grave, or any of that tosh, does she? As if I were there!'  'No, no, she goes ratting, Dick.'  'Good old Fido!'  'Dick, here's a good one. We oughtn't to keep a dog at all because we are on rations now; but what do you think Fido ate yesterday?'

Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?

There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'
EN019	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$That's five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It's not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke, and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good.  What was it you got?  Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.  Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....  Son of God deliver us.  Now you'll not marry her the time I'm rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.
EN018	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a sheep.  It's true the Lord God formed you to contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?  Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?  Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her pigsty and not plague us here.  I'm going; but he'll come with me.  Are you dumb, young fellow?  God increase you; but I'm pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.  Now you have heard him, and go on from this.  It's lonesome this hour crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.  Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will send you now.  Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.  What's that she's after saying?

Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'  'Yes, it was to a wedding.'  'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'  'Tell me, Ellen.'  'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'  'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'  'I thought you might be a little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.'  'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'  'It _is_ funny, John. I ran back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.'  'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'  'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'  'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'  'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'  'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too old yet.'  'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.'  'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard nothing.'  'Dering?'  'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'  'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'  'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'  'They have all gone to the war, John.'  'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'  'Oh, John!'  'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'  'Yes, I know, John.'  He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes here. He is a captain.'  'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'  'She has soon forgotten.'  'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'  'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'  'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'  'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'  'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may even have killed each other.'  'They hadn't known, Ellen.'  'I daresay they knew.'  'Billy boy and Karl!'  'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'  'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'  'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'  'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here, John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'  'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'  'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.'  'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'  'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'  'No, no, let's pretend.'  'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little touchy about that.'  'Not a word!'  'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'  'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'  'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'  'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'  'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'  'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'  'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'
EN014	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'
EN017	1	She hasn't come yet, is it, and it falling to the night?  She has not. . . It's dark with the clouds are coming from the west and south, but it isn't later than the common.  It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not. Would you have him see you, and he a man would be jealous of a hawk would fly between her and the rising sun.

There they are now at the door.  The gods save you.  getting up and courtesy-ing. -- The gods save and keep you kindly, and stand between you and all harm for ever.  Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  Bring them out and use them from this day.  We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$A bloody-handed murderer the like of...  Whisht I am saying; we'll take no fooling from your like at all.And you, young fellow, you'd have a right to stop, I'm thinking, for we'd do our all and utmost to content your needs.  And I'd be safe in this place from the searching law?  You would, surely. If they're not fearing you, itself, the peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows, wouldn't touch a cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night.  Let you stop a short while anyhow. Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.  It's a nice room, and if it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.  Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door, and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk at the wake.  And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?  Christopher Mahon.  Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.  God bless you all.  God bless you.  Are you wanting me to stop along with you and keep you from harm?  Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?  There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it too.  You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step off nimble this time when there's none.  Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...  Go on, then, to Father Reilly, and let him put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.  If I meet the Widow Quin...  Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your noise. That lad would wear the spirits from the saints of peace. timidly. Then she comes to him and speaks with bland good-humour.) Let you stretch out now by the fire, young fellow. You should be destroyed travelling.
EN016	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was courting each other just like the rest of yeez.  Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.  Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at him?  Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez are. Will you look at the red color in his face?  If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.  Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's a fine girl, if I do say it myself.  Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain to spake her piece.  LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.  Blessed old Santa Claus, king of delights, What are you doing these long winter nights? Filling your budgets with trinkets and toys, Wonderful gifts for the girls and the boys. While you are planning for everything nice, Pray let me give you a bit of advice.  Don't take it hard if I say in your ear, Santa, I thought you were partial last year; Loading the rich folks with everything gay, Snubbing the poor ones who came in your way. Now of all times of the year I am sure This is the time to remember the poor.
EN011	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?
EN010	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves.

EN013	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$But, bless my heart, consider my position! I am the wife of one, that's very clear; But who can tell, except by intuition, Which is the Prince, and which the Gondolier?  Submit to Fate without unseemly wrangle: Such complications frequently occur-- Life is one closely complicated tangle: Death is the only true unraveller!  Try we life-long, we can never Straighten out life's tangled skein, Why should we, in vain endeavour, Guess and guess and guess again?  Life's a pudding full of plums,  Care's a canker that benumbs.  Life's a pudding full of plums, Care's a canker that benumbs. Wherefore waste our elocution On impossible solution? Life's a pleasant institution, Let us take it as it comes!  Set aside the dull enigma, We shall guess it all too soon; Failure brings no kind of stigma-- Dance we to another tune!  String the lyre and fill the cup, Lest on sorrow we should sup.  Hop and skip to Fancy's fiddle, Hands across and down the middle-- Life's perhaps the only riddle That we shrink from giving up!    Bridegroom and bride! Knot that's insoluble, Voices all voluble Hail it with pride. Bridegroom and bride! We in sincerity Wish you prosperity, Bridegroom and bride! When a merry maiden marries, Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries; Every sound becomes a song, All is right, and nothing's wrong! From to-day and ever after Let our tears be tears of laughter. Every sigh that finds a vent Be a sigh of sweet content! When you marry, merry maiden, Then the air with love is laden; Every flower is a rose, Every goose becomes a swan, Every kind of trouble goes Where the last year's snows have gone! Sunlight takes the place of shade When you marry, merry maid!  When a merry maiden marries, Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries; Every sound becomes a song, All is right, and nothing's wrong. Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow, Get ye gone until to-morrow; Jealousies in grim array, Ye are things of yesterday! When you marry, merry maiden, Then the air with joy is laden; All the corners of the earth Ring with music sweetly played, Worry is melodious mirth, Grief is joy in masquerade;
EN012	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$'Yes, perhaps.'  'Good-night, Robert.'  'Good-night, dear.'  'Dick!'  'I have come to sit with you for a bit, father.'  'It's you, Dick; it's you!'  'It's me all right, father. I say, don't be startled, or anything of that kind. We don't like that.'  'My boy!'  'How am I looking, father?'  'You haven't altered, Dick.'  'Rather not. It's jolly to see the old studio again! I say, father, don't fuss. Let us be our ordinary selves, won't you?'  'I'll try, I'll try. You didn't say you had come to sit with me, Dick? Not with me!'  'Rather!'  'But your mother----'  'It's you I want.'  'Me?'  'We can only come to one, you see.'  'Then why me?'  'That's the reason. Hello, here's your old jacket, greasier than ever!'  'Me? But, Dick, it is as if you had forgotten. It was your mother who was everything to you. It can't be you if you have forgotten that. I used to feel so out of it; but, of course, you didn't know.'  'I didn't know it till lately, father; but heaps of things that I didn't know once are clear to me now. I didn't know that you were the one who would miss me most; but I know now.'  'Me miss you most? Dick, I try to paint just as before. I go to the club. Dick, I have been to a dinner-party. I said I wouldn't give in.'  'We like that.'  'But, my boy----'  'I say, father, let's get away from that sort of thing.'  'That is so like you, Dick! I'll do anything you ask.'  'Then keep a bright face.'  'I've tried to.'  'Good man! I say, put on your old greasy; you are looking so beastly clean.'  'Anything you like. No, that's the wrong sleeve. Thanks, Dick.'  'Here, let me shove you into your old seat.'  'How's that, umpire!'  'Dick, that's just how you used to butt me into it long ago!'  'When I was a kid.'  'With the palette in my hand.'  'Or sticking to your trousers.'  'The mess we made of ourselves, Dick.' 'I sneaked behind the settle and climbed up it.'  'Till you fell off.'  'On top of you and the palette.'  'Ah, Dick.'  'Now then, behave! What did I say about that face?'  'That's better. I'll sit here.'  'Got your pipe?'  'I don't--I don't seem to care to smoke nowadays, Dick.'  'Rot! Just because I am dead! You that pretend to be plucky! I won't have it, you know. You get your pipe, and look slippy about it.'  'Yes, Dick, Now, then, burn your thumb with the match--you always did, you know. That's the style. You've forgotten to cock your head to the side. Not so bad. That's you. Like it?'  'It's rather nice, Dick. Dick, you and me by the fire!'  'Yes, but sit still. How often we might have been like this, father, and weren't.'  'Ah!'  'Face. How is Fido?'  'Never a dog missed her master more.'  'Oh, She doesn't want to go and sit on my grave, or any of that tosh, does she? As if I were there!'  'No, no, she goes ratting, Dick.'  'Good old Fido!'  'Dick, here's a good one. We oughtn't to keep a dog at all because we are on rations now; but what do you think Fido ate yesterday?'
EN491	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.  Is it dead he is or living?  It's little you care if it's dead or living I am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead. Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half in your skin.

You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?

Ay love your mo'der too much for ever do dat, Anna.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'
EN493	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$'I have come back, John, It hasn't seemed very long, has it?'  'No, not long, Ellen. Had you a nice walk?'  'I haven't been for a walk. Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'  'Yes, it was to a wedding.'  'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'  'Tell me, Ellen.'  'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'  'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'  'I thought you might be a little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.'  'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'  'It _is_ funny, John. I ran back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.'  'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'  'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'  'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'  'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'  'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too old yet.'  'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.'  'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard nothing.'  'Dering?'  'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'  'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'  'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'  'They have all gone to the war, John.'  'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'  'Oh, John!'  'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'  'Yes, I know, John.'  He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes here. He is a captain.'  'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'  'She has soon forgotten.'  'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'  'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'  'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'  'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'  'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may even have killed each other.'  'They hadn't known, Ellen.'  'I daresay they knew.'  'Billy boy and Karl!'  'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'  'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'  'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'  'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here, John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'  'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'  'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.'  'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'  'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'  'No, no, let's pretend.'  'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little touchy about that.'  'Not a word!'  'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'  'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'  'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'  'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'  'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'  'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'  'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.

Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  Bring them out and use them from this day.  We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor. All say there isn't her match at fancying figures and throwing purple upon crimson, and she edging them all times with her greens and gold.  a little uneasily. -- Is she keeping wise and busy since I passed before, and growing ready for her life in Emain?  dryly. -- That is a question will give small pleasure to yourself or me. If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'
EN495	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$There's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them, and he not reckoning them at all.  Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's gone?  It is surely.  That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath.  He was a great man surely, stranger, and isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man, and he mad dying?  It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.  I heard tell this day, Nora Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself.  It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.  I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in a lonesome place you live itself.  It's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men, for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day, Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.  Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man?  What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?
EN494	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$Who's there?  Me.  Who's me?  The Widow Quin.  Go on now with your supper, and let on to be sleepy, for if she found you were such a warrant to talk, she'd be stringing gabble till the dawn of day.  What ails you, or what is it you're wanting at this hour of the night?  I'm after meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below, who told me of your curiosity man, and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring, romping on your hands with drink.  Look now is he roaring, and he stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk. Walk down and tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh.  I'll not see them again, for I've their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me.  This night, is it?  This night. "It isn't fitting," says the priesteen, "to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl."  God save you, mister!  God save you kindly.  Well, aren't you a little smiling fellow? It should have been great and bitter torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood.  It should, maybe.  It's more than "maybe" I'm saying, and it'd soften my heart to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake, and you fitter to be saying your catechism than slaying your da.  There's talking when any'd see he's fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world. Walk on from this, for I'll not have him tormented and he destroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week.  We'll be walking surely when his supper's done, and you'll find we're great company, young fellow, when it's of the like of you and me you'd hear the penny poets singing in an August Fair.  Did you kill your father?  She did not. She hit himself with a worn pick, and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never overed it, and died after. That was a sneaky kind of murder did win small glory with the boys itself.
EN497	0	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$He's a hog on two legs.  You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.

Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing.

Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.
EN330	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my nose. It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about the rain, and Darcy the devil choke him--and the towering church. Give me that whisky. Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all?  Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.  Is it that?  It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a bad wife in the house.  Is it herself, master of the house, and she a grand woman to talk?  It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still. Let you wait now a short while, and it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. Is that somebody above?  There's a voice speaking on the path.  Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying. Be falling to sleep now and don't let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life. I wouldn't have told you at all but it's destroyed with the drouth I was.  Have no fear, master of the house. What is it I know of the like of you that I'ld be saying a word or putting out my
EN445	1	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN238	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$'Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things to do: and you, too, Barbara. They are leaving in an hour, John.'  'If you would like to take Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the garden.'  'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'  'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'  'But there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'  'Let me, dear,'  'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'  'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is. There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew, he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go to the alder pool, Barbara.'  'We won't go there, dear.'  'Did I do all right, Ellen?'  'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'  'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion! I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'  'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to you; you like that, don't you?'  'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No, I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'  'Barbara?'  'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'  'Which bit shall I read?'  'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.' 'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun to laugh already.'  'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'  'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish? Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'  'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'  'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'  'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but something prevents him.'  'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'  'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better. Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'  'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little light?'  'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it helps one to concentrate.'   'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you still there?'  'I think I felt a movement.'  'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'  'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'  'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'  'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'  'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'  'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with A?--with B? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the fourth word Welcome? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me Welcome.'
EN068	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned. Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?  What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
EN069	1	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$Sure.  It's a great wonder you didn't forget it--and me without a chew.  Ouch! Darn you!  Shut your big mouth! What is the matter with you at all?  She pinched me--hard as she could, too--and look at her laughin'!  Cry-baby! I owed you one.  I'll fix you. I'll tell Eileen, wait 'n' see!  Tattle-tale! I don't care. Eileen's sick.  That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get even, you bet!  Shut up your noise! Go up to bed, the two of you, and no more talk, and you go with them, Mary.  Come on, Mary. Wake up.  Ow!  Hush your noise, you soft, weak thing, you! It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the time. I'll have a moment's peace, I will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!  Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?  No. The doctor's with her yet. Yes, go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
EN060	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night.  You should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and Spain.  We were great surely, with wide and windy acres of rich Munster land.  Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?  Is it me?  Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?  I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in the naked parish where I grew a man.  If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking, and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.  I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't fearing you at all.  You've said the like of that, maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.  I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine prancing women making laughter with the men.  If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.  You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you single now?  What would I want wedding so young?  We're alike, so.

'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN062	0	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?

Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN065	1	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all the same mopin' and lazin' in it. It's the bad luck I've been havin' altogether this last year since your mother died. Who's to do the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. hat a fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a millionaire! Mary, dear, it's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most. What are you sniffin' at?  I was thinking--of Mamma.  It's late you are with your tears, and her cold in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!  Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself?  Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I beat him.  Slow poke!  You didn't beat me, neither!  I did, too!  You did not! You didn't play fair. You tripped me comin' up the steps. Brick-top! Cheater!  You're a liar! You stumbled over your own big feet, clumsy bones! And I beat you fair Didn't I, Papa?  You did, darlin', and fair, too. Sure it's you can beat the divil himself!  See? Liar!  Did you get the plug for me I told you?
EN066	0	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$'I'll try not to,'  'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong about me.'  'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN067	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$'That movement again! Don't you want me to go on?'  'Let us stop.'  'Not unless he wishes it. Why are those words so important? Does the message end there? Is any one working against you? Some one antagonistic? Yes. Not one of ourselves surely? No. Is it any one we know? Yes. Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of this person's name A?--B?----'  'Is the second letter A?'  'FA. Fa----?'  'Is the word Father? Yes.'  'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'  'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'  'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly antagonistic, is he?'  'I am afraid he is.'  'But he must admit that we do get messages.'  'He says we think we do. He says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'  'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'  'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'  'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'  'He said it was.'  'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'  'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't thinking of it at all.'  'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'  'I'll go.'  'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'  'As to that--as to that----'  'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'  'No, don't.'  'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'  'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'  'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'  'You see, Dick and I were not very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'  'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'  'I'll go.'  'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'  'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'  'No, no, don't.'  'It would be all right, Don.'  'I don't know.'  'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel I--should like to be alone.'  'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'  'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening. I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'  'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather not. Thanks, awfully.'  'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'  'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'  'Dick's fishing-rods.'  'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'  'That's all right, Grace.'  'I think I shall go to Laura now.'  'Yes,'  'Poor child!'  'I'm afraid I hurt her.'  'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'  'Why not, Grace?'  'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father.'  'I daresay.'  'How you can read about the war nowadays!'  'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's just that I can't believe in it.'  'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was to me.'  'I don't know.'  'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'

Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen.

Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?

I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$I never married with one, let alone with a couple or three.  Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn. Were you off east, young fellow, fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the Boers?  I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week.  He's done nothing, so. If you didn't commit murder or a bad, nasty thing, or false coining, or robbery, or butchery, or the like of them, there isn't anything that would be worth your troubling for to run from now. You did nothing at all.  That's an unkindly thing to be saying to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging before, and hell's gap gaping below.  You're only saying it. You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the windpipe of a screeching sow.  You're not speaking the truth.  Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?  Don't strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the like of that.  Is it killed your father?  With the help of God I did surely, and that the Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.  There's a daring fellow.  Oh, glory be to God!  That was a hanging crime, mister honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.  He was a dirty man, God forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up with him at all.  And you shot him dead?  I never used weapons. I've no license, and I'm a law-fearing man.  It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world it's bloody knives they use.  Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?  You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers swearing it had life?
EN243	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$'Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things to do: and you, too, Barbara. They are leaving in an hour, John.'  'If you would like to take Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the garden.'  'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'  'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'  'But there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'  'Let me, dear,'  'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'  'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is. There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew, he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go to the alder pool, Barbara.'  'We won't go there, dear.'  'Did I do all right, Ellen?'  'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'  'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion! I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'  'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to you; you like that, don't you?'  'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No, I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'  'Barbara?'  'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'  'Which bit shall I read?'  'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.' 'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun to laugh already.'  'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'  'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish? Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'  'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'  'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'  'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but something prevents him.'  'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'  'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better. Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'  'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little light?'  'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it helps one to concentrate.'   'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you still there?'  'I think I felt a movement.'  'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'  'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'  'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'  'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'  'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'  'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with A?--with B? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the fourth word Welcome? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me Welcome.'
EN244	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold.  Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.  God rest his soul.  Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.  The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.  I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.  Thank you kindly, lady of the house.  Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.  I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.  Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?  There's no offence, lady of the house?  No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all?
EN245	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'

I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$I perceive, from the tea cups, Crichton, that the great function is to take place here.  Yes, sir.  The servants' hall coming up to have tea in the drawing-room! No wonder you look happy, Crichton.  No, sir.  Do you know, Crichton, I think that with an effort you might look even happier. You don't approve of his lordship's compelling his servants to be his equals--once a month?  It is not for me, sir, to disapprove of his lordship's radical views.  Certainly not. And, after all, it is only once a month that he is affable to you.  On all other days of the month, sir, his lordship's treatment of us is everything that could be desired. Tea cups! Life, Crichton, is like a cup of tea; the more heartily we drink, the sooner we reach the dregs.  Thank you, sir.  as we do when we have need of an ally). Crichton, in case I should be asked to say a few words to the servants, I have strung together a little speech. I was wondering where I should stand.  with the best intentions, gives him a footstool to stand on, and departs, happily unconscious that ERNEST in some dudgeon has kicked the footstool across the room.)  Suppose you were all little fishes at the bottom of the sea  And how are my little friends to-day?  Don't be silly, Ernest. If you want to know how we are, we are dead. Even to think of entertaining the servants is so exhausting.  Besides which, we have had to decide what frocks to take with us on the yacht, and that is such a mental strain.  You poor over-worked things. Rest your weary limbs.  But why have you a footstool in your hand?  Yes?  Why? You see, as the servants are to be the guests I must be butler. I was practising. This is a tray, observe.  Tea, my lady? It is only you, Ernest; I thought there was some one here.  Had a very tiring day also, Mary?  Dreadfully. Been trying on engagement-rings all the morning.  What's that? Is it Brocklehurst?  You have given your warm young heart to Brocky?  I don't wish to fatigue you, Mary, by insisting on a verbal answer, but if, without straining yourself, you can signify Yes or No, won't you make the effort?  The ring! Then I am too late, too late! (Fixing LADY MARY sternly, like a prosecuting counsel.) May I ask, Mary, does Brocky know? Of course, it was that terrible mother of his who pulled this through. Mother does everything for Brocky. Still, in the eyes of the law you will be, not her wife, but his, and, therefore, I hold that Brocky ought to be informed. Now--  If you girls are shamming sleep in the expectation that I shall awaken you in the manner beloved of ladies, abandon all such hopes.  You impertinent boy.  I knew that was it, though I don't know everything. Agatha, I'm not young enough to know everything.  Young enough?  Don't you see? I'm not young enough to know
EN247	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Come along with me now, lady of the house, and it's not my blather you'll be hearing only, but you'll be hearing the herons crying out over the black lakes, and you'll be hearing the grouse and the owls with them, and the larks and the big thrushes when the days are warm, and it's not from the like of them you'll be hearing a talk of getting old like Peggy Cavanagh, and losing the hair off you, and the light of your eyes, but it's fine songs you'll be hearing when the sun goes up, and there'll be no old fellow wheezing, the like of a sick sheep, close to your ear.  I'm thinking it's myself will be wheezing that time with lying down under the Heavens when the night is cold; but you've a fine bit of talk, stranger, and it's with yourself I'll go.  You think it's a grand thing you're after doing with your letting on to be dead, but what is it at all? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this place, and she not making a talk with the men passing? And what way will yourself live from this day, with none to care for you? What is it you'll have now but a black life, Daniel Burke, and it's not long I'm telling you, till you'll be lying again under that sheet, and you dead surely.  Sit down now and take a little taste of the stuff, Micheal Dara. There's a great drouth on me, and the night is young.  And it's very dry I am, surely, with the fear of death you put on me, and I after driving mountain ewes since the turn of the day.  I was thinking to strike you, Micheal Dara, but you're a quiet man, God help you, and I don't mind you at all.  Your good health, Micheal Dara.  God reward you, Daniel Burke, and may you have a long life, and a quiet life, and good health with it.

There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with me.  And where is he now?  Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.  Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay for Mrs. O'Toole.

EN249	1	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with me.  And where is he now?  Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.  Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay for Mrs. O'Toole.  I can't drink any tay. I'm that injured I can't drink at all, at all.  A drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.  Yis, mum.  I was out in me cabbage garden picking a bit of cabbage for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water. And I'm almost killed entirely--and it's all the fault of your goat, Mrs. Mulligan.  There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things easy.  I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan.

EN086	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$I did not then. I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of it on the ridge of his skull, and he went down at my feet like an empty sack, and never let a grunt or groan from him at all.  And what way weren't you hanged, mister? Did you bury him then?  Aye. I buried him then. Wasn't I digging spuds in the field?  And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that you're out?  Never a one of them, and I walking forward facing hog, dog, or divil on the highway of the road.  It's only with a common week-day kind of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase, and that man should be a great terror when his temper's roused.  He should then. And where was it, mister honey, that you did the deed?  Oh, a distant place, master of the house, a windy corner of high, distant hills.  He's a close man, and he's right, surely.  That'd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a pot-boy, Michael James, if it's the truth you're seeking one at all.  The peelers is fearing him, and if you'd that lad in the house there isn't one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard.  Bravery's a treasure in a lonesome place, and a lad would kill his father, I'm thinking, would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on the flags of hell.  It's the truth they're saying, and if I'd that lad in the house, I wouldn't be fearing the loosed kharki cut-throats, or the walking dead.  Well, glory be to God!  Would you think well to stop here and be pot-boy, mister honey, if we gave you good wages, and didn't destroy you with the weight of work?  That'd be a queer kind to bring into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike.  Will you whisht? Who's speaking to you?
EN087	0	I'll do it, Annie--for your sake--if you say it's needful for ye.  God bless you for that, David!  The ice is breakin' up to no'the'ard, sir. There's a clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond, the lookout says.  A clear passage? To no'the'ard?  Yes, sir.  Then get her ready and we'll drive her through.  Aye, aye, sir.  David! David!  Will the men turn to willin' or must we drag 'em out?  They'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God into 'em, sir. They're meek as lambs.  KEENEY. Then drive 'em--both watches. [_With grim determination._] They's whale t'other side o' this floe and we're agoin' to git 'em.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir.  And I was agoin' home like a yaller dog!  David!  Woman, you ain't adoin' right when you meddle in men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I got to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in. I got to git the ile, I tell ye. David! Aren't you going home?  You ain't well. Go and lay down a mite. I got to git on deck.  David!  Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? Annie! What is it? Don't you know me, Annie?  You said--you was agoin' mad--God!  Whales, sir--a whole school of 'em--off the star-b'd quarter 'bout five miles away--big ones!  Are you lowerin' the boats?  MATE. Yes, sir.  I'm acomin' with ye.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir. You'll git the ile now right enough, sir.  Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git the ile. [I know you're foolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind--be you? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while longer, Annie--then we'll turn home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?  All ready, sir.  Comin', sir?$$$I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night.  You should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and Spain.  We were great surely, with wide and windy acres of rich Munster land.  Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?  Is it me?  Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?  I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in the naked parish where I grew a man.  If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking, and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.  I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't fearing you at all.  You've said the like of that, maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.  I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine prancing women making laughter with the men.  If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.  You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you single now?  What would I want wedding so young?  We're alike, so.

Give me drink for take back--one port vine for Anna--she calabrate dis one time with me--and small beer for me.  Small beer for you, eh? She's reformin' you already.  You bet! You look tired, Anna. Veil, Ay make you take good long rest now. Come, you drink vine. It put new life in you. Skoal, Anna! You know dat Svedish word?  Skoal! Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!       Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.
EN085	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$'That movement again! Don't you want me to go on?'  'Let us stop.'  'Not unless he wishes it. Why are those words so important? Does the message end there? Is any one working against you? Some one antagonistic? Yes. Not one of ourselves surely? No. Is it any one we know? Yes. Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of this person's name A?--B?----'  'Is the second letter A?'  'FA. Fa----?'  'Is the word Father? Yes.'  'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'  'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'  'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly antagonistic, is he?'  'I am afraid he is.'  'But he must admit that we do get messages.'  'He says we think we do. He says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'  'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'  'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'  'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'  'He said it was.'  'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'  'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't thinking of it at all.'  'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'  'I'll go.'  'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'  'As to that--as to that----'  'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'  'No, don't.'  'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'  'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'  'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'  'You see, Dick and I were not very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'  'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'  'I'll go.'  'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'  'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'  'No, no, don't.'  'It would be all right, Don.'  'I don't know.'  'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel I--should like to be alone.'  'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'  'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening. I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'  'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather not. Thanks, awfully.'  'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'  'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'  'Dick's fishing-rods.'  'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'  'That's all right, Grace.'  'I think I shall go to Laura now.'  'Yes,'  'Poor child!'  'I'm afraid I hurt her.'  'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'  'Why not, Grace?'  'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father.'  'I daresay.'  'How you can read about the war nowadays!'  'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's just that I can't believe in it.'  'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was to me.'  'I don't know.'  'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'
EN082	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night.

I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine prancing women making laughter with the men.  If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.  You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you single now?  What would I want wedding so young?  We're alike, so.
EN083	1	Gawd, I can't stand this! I better beat it.  Well, who's the blond?  Dat vas Anna, Larry.  Your daughter, Anna?  Don't you tank she vas pooty gel, Larry?  Sure! A peach!  You bet you! Give me drink for take back--one port vine for Anna--she calabrate dis one time with me--and small beer for me.  Small beer for you, eh? She's reformin' you already.  You bet! You look tired, Anna. Veil, Ay make you take good long rest now. Come, you drink vine. It put new life in you. Skoal, Anna! You know dat Svedish word?  Skoal! Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!       Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all the same mopin' and lazin' in it. It's the bad luck I've been havin' altogether this last year since your mother died. Who's to do the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. hat a fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a millionaire! Mary, dear, it's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most. What are you sniffin' at?  I was thinking--of Mamma.  It's late you are with your tears, and her cold in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!  Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself?  Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I beat him.  Slow poke!  You didn't beat me, neither!  I did, too!  You did not! You didn't play fair. You tripped me comin' up the steps. Brick-top! Cheater!  You're a liar! You stumbled over your own big feet, clumsy bones! And I beat you fair Didn't I, Papa?  You did, darlin', and fair, too. Sure it's you can beat the divil himself!  See? Liar!  Did you get the plug for me I told you?
EN080	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold.  Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.  God rest his soul.  Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.  The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.  I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.  Thank you kindly, lady of the house.  Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.  I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.  Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?  There's no offence, lady of the house?  No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all?
EN081	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$There's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them, and he not reckoning them at all.  Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's gone?  It is surely.  That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath.  He was a great man surely, stranger, and isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man, and he mad dying?  It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.  I heard tell this day, Nora Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself.  It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.  I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in a lonesome place you live itself.  It's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men, for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day, Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.  Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man?  What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?

I'd be afeard to do that, except I was the like of yourself with blind rages tearing me within, for I'm thinking you should have had great tussling when the end was come.  We had not then. It was a hard woman was come over the hill, and if he was always a crusty kind when he'd a hard woman setting him on, not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up with him at all.  And isn't it a great wonder that one wasn't fearing you?  Up to the day I killed my father, there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no man giving me heed.  It was the girls were giving you heed maybe, and I'm thinking it's most conceit you'd have to be gaming with their like.  Not the girls itself, and I won't tell you a lie. There wasn't anyone heeding me in that place saving only the dumb beasts of the field.  And I thinking you should have been living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world.  The like of a king, is it? And I after toiling, moiling, digging, dodging from the dawn till dusk with never a sight of joy or sport saving only when I'd be abroad in the dark night poaching rabbits on hills, for I was a devil to poach, God forgive me, and I near got six months for going with a dung fork and stabbing a fish.  And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?  I did, God help me, and there I'd be as happy as the sunshine of St. Martin's Day, watching the light passing the north or the patches of fog, till I'd hear a rabbit starting to screech and I'd go running in the furze.

You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky.

It's above at the cross-roads he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him to Kate Cassidy's wake.  And he's going that length in the dark night?  He is surely, and leaving me lonesome on the scruff of the hill. Isn't it long the nights are now, Shawn Keogh, to be leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of day?

EN123	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Yes, that's the sort of politician for my money!  Then we'll consider it settled. Now, as the country is in a state of insurrection, it is absolutely necessary that you should assume the reins of Government at once; and, until it is ascertained which of you is to be king, I have arranged that you will reign jointly, so that no question can arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts.  As one individual?  As one individual.  Like this?  Something like that.  And we may take our friends with us, and give them places about the Court?  Undoubtedly. That's always done!  I'm convinced!  So am I!  Then the sooner we're off the better.  We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)--  Stop, stop--that won't do at all--ladies are not admitted.  What!  Not admitted. Not at present. Afterwards, perhaps. We'll see.  Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate us from our wives!  This is very awkward! Only for a time--a few months. Alter all, what is a few months?  But we've only been married half an hour!   Kind sir, you cannot have the heart Our lives to part From those to whom an hour ago We were united! Before our flowing hopes you stem, Ah, look at them, And pause before you deal this blow, All uninvited! You men can never understand That heart and hand Cannot be separated when We go a-yearning; You see, you've only women's eyes To idolize And only women's hearts, poor men, To set you burning! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!  Some kind of charm you seem to find In womankind-- Some source of unexplained delight (Unless you're jesting), But what attracts you, I confess, I cannot guess, To me a woman's face is quite Uninteresting! If from my sister I were torn, It could be borne-- I should, no doubt, be horrified, But I could bear it;-- But Marco's quite another thing-- He is my King, He has my heart and none beside Shall ever share it! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!

But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind.

But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night.  You should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and Spain.  We were great surely, with wide and windy acres of rich Munster land.  Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?  Is it me?  Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?  I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in the naked parish where I grew a man.  If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking, and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.  I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't fearing you at all.  You've said the like of that, maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.  I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine prancing women making laughter with the men.  If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.  You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you single now?  What would I want wedding so young?  We're alike, so.
EN088	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road, and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.  Providence and Mercy, spare us all!  It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.  I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?  The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.  Well, you should have been a queer lot. I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more years of age.  Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a Tuesday and halve his skull.  Well, you'll have peace in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.  It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in me and bravery of...  Oh, glory! it's late for knocking, and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.

She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  Bring them out and use them from this day.  We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor. All say there isn't her match at fancying figures and throwing purple upon crimson, and she edging them all times with her greens and gold.  a little uneasily. -- Is she keeping wise and busy since I passed before, and growing ready for her life in Emain?  dryly. -- That is a question will give small pleasure to yourself or me. If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$At last we have arrived at our destination. This is the Ducal Palace, and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor resides. As a Castilian hidalgo of ninety-five quarterings, I regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse. As a Castilian hidalgo of that description, I should have preferred to ride through the streets of Venice; but owing, I presume, to an unusually wet season, the streets are in such a condition that equestrian exercise is impracticable. No matter. Where is our suite? Your Grace, I am here.  Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when you address His Grace? My love, it is so small a matter! Still, you may as well do it.  The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian hidalgo.  My child, you are hard upon our suite.  Papa, I've no patience with the presumption of persons in his plebeian position. If he does not appreciate that position, let him be whipped until he does.  And you'll discover never A tale so free from every doubt-- All probable, possible shadow of doubt-- All possible doubt whatever!  A tale free from every doubt, etc.  Then do you mean to say that I am married to one of two gondoliers, but it is impossible to say which?  Without any doubt of any kind whatever. But be reassured: the nurse to whom your husband was entrusted is the mother of the musical young man who is such a past-master of that delicately modulated instrument (indicating the drum). She can, no doubt, establish the King's identity beyond all question.  Heavens, how did he know that?  My young friend, a Grand Inquisitor is always up to date. His mother is at present the wife of a highly respectable and old-established brigand, who carries on an extensive practice in the mountains around Cordova. Accompanied by two of my emissaries, he will set off at once for his mother's address. She will return with them, and if she finds any difficulty in making up her mind, the persuasive influence of the torture chamber will jog her memory.
EN161	0	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$You stick to me, Brocky, and I'll pull you through.  Monsieur Fleury.  The chef.  Very charmed to see you, Monsieur Fleury.  Thank you very much.  Agatha--recitation!  Mr. Rolleston.  How do you do, Rolleston?  Mr. Tompsett.  Miss Fisher.  This is a pleasure, Miss Fisher.  If I might venture, Miss Fisher  Miss Simmons.  You are always welcome, Miss Simmons.  At last we meet. Won't you sit down?  Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Charmed to see you, Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Mr. Treherne, this is Fisher, my maid.  Your what, Mary?  My friend. Thomas.  How do you do, Thomas?  John.  How do you do, John?  Brocklehurst, this is John. I think you have already met on the door-step.  Jane.  Give me your hand, Jane.  Gladys.  How do you do, Gladys. You know my uncle?  Your hand, Gladys.  Tweeny.  So happy to see you.  John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce me.  That's an uncommon pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.  No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.  They are not all here, Crichton.  Odds and ends. Which is to recite?  And how are all at home?  Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?  No, no, the family. How's the baby?  Blooming, your lordship.  A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice little fellow.  Beg pardon, my lord, it's a girl.  A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.  Very delighted to see you, Crichton.  Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?  Milk and sugar, Crichton?  I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.  To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful. Oh, please do speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?  It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.  I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.  I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.  Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything?  I have no idea, my lady.  But you laughed.  My lady, he is the second son of a peer.  Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.
EN160	0	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$'Did you? I should have liked to see that. I have often oiled their bats for them. Careless lads, they always forget. Was that nice German boy with him?'  'Mr. Karl? Not far off, sir. He was sitting by the bank of the stream playing on his flute; and Miss Barbara, she had climbed one of my apple-trees,--she says they are your trees.'  'They are, you know, Dering,'  'Yes, sir, in a sense, but I don't like any of you to meddle with them. And there she sat, pelting the two of them with green apples.'  'How like her! I don't know how we are to make a demure young lady of her.'  'They say in the village, sir, that Master Will would like to try.'  'Ha! ha! he is just a colt himself. Who are all here now, Dering; in the house, I mean? I sometimes forget. They grow old so quickly. They go out at one door in the bloom of youth, and come back by another, tired and grey. Haven't you noticed it?'  'No, sir. The only visitors staying here are Miss Barbara and Mr. Karl. There's just them and yourselves, sir, you and the mistress and Master Will. That's all.'  'Yes, that's all,' his master says, still unconvinced. 'Who is the soldier, Dering?'  'Soldier, sir? There is no soldier here except yourself.'  'Isn't there? There was a nurse with him. Who is ill?'  'No one, sir. There's no nurse.' Dering backs away from the old man. Would you like me to call the mistress, sir?'  'No, she has gone down to the village. She told me why, but I forget. Miss Barbara is with her.'  'Miss Barbara is down by the stream, sir.'  'Is she? I think they said they were going to a wedding. Who is being married to-day, Dering?'  'I have heard of no wedding, sir. But here is Miss Barbara.'  'Here's the tomboy!'  'Dering, I believe you are complaining to the Colonel about my watering the flowers at the wrong time of day.''Aha! Aha!'  'I did just mention it, miss.'  'You horrid! Dear, don't mind him. And every time he says they are his flowers and his apples, you tell me, and I shall say to his face that they are yours.'  'The courage of those young things!'  'Let me make you comfy--the way granny does it.'  'That is not quite the way she does it, Do you call her granny, Barbara?'  'She asked me to--for practice. Don't you remember why?'  'I know! Billy boy.'  'You are quick today. Now, wait till I get your cane.'  'I don't need my cane while I'm sitting.'  'You look so beau'ful, sitting holding your cane. Oh dear! I am a clumsy.'  Not at all, but perhaps if I were to do it for myself. That's better. Thank you, Barbara, very much.'  'I didn't do it. I'm all thumbs. What a ghastly nurse I should make.'  'Nurse? Who is she, Barbara?'  'Who is who, dear?'  'That nurse.'  'There's no nurse here.'  'Isn't there?'  'Where is granny?'  'She has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'There's no wedding. Who could be being married?'  'I think it's people I know, but I can't remember who they are. I thought you went too, Barbara.'  'Not I. Catch me missing it if there had been a wedding!'  'You and the nurse.'  'Dear, you have just been imagining things again. Shall I play to you, or sing? Oh dear, everything catches in me. Would you like me to "Robin Adair," dear?'  'No, thank you, Barbara. Barbara, the house seems so empty. Where are Billy and Karl?'  'Billy is where Karl is, you may be sure.'  'And where is Karl?'  'He is where Billy boy is, you may be sure.'  'And where are they both?'  'Not far from where Barbara is, you bet. Do you hear Karl's flute? They have been down all the morning at the pool where the alder is, trying to catch that bull-trout.'  'They didn't get him, I'll swear!'  'You can ask them.'  'I spent a lot of my youth trying to get that bull-trout. I tumbled in there sixty years ago.'  'I tumbled in sixty minutes ago! It can't be the same trout, dear.'  'Same old rascal!'  'You muddy things!'  'Did you get the bull-trout, Billy boy?'  'He's a brute that.'  'He is, you know.'  BILLY. 'He came up several times and had a look at my fly. Didn't flick it, or do anything as complimentary as that. Just yawned and went down.'  COLONEL. 'Yawned, did he? Used to wink in my time. Did you and Billy fish at Heidelberg, Karl?'  KARL. 'We were more worthily employed, sir, but we did unbend at times. Billy, do you remember--' He begins a gay dance.
EN235	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$Then I run, and I run, and I run, till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain
EN234	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$'That's better,'  'I think I'll go to my room now. You will come up, mater?'  'Yes, dear. I shan't be five minutes, John.'  'More like half an hour.'  'There is nothing wrong, is there? I thought I noticed a--a----'  'A certain liveliness, my dear. No, we were only having a good talk.'  'What about, John?'  'About the war,'  'About tactics and strategy, wasn't it, Roger?'  'Yes.'  'The fact is, Ellen, I have been helping Roger to take his first trench.' With a big breath, 'And we took it too, together, didn't we, Roger?'  'You bet,'  'Though I suppose,' sighing, 'it is one of those trenches that the enemy retake during the night.'  'Oh, I--I don't know, father.'  'Whatever are you two talking about?'  'Aha, it is very private. We don't tell you everything, you know, Ellen.'  'Come on, mater, it's only his beastly sarcasm again. 'Night, father; I won't see you in the morning.'  ''Night,'  'Good-night, dear father.'  'A beautiful morning, Dering.'  'Too much sun, sir. The roses be complaining, and, to make matters worse, Miss Barbara has been watering of them--in the heat of the day.'  'Has she? She means well. Dering, you heard it, didn't you?'  'What was that, sir?'  'The thunderstorm--early this morning.'  'There was no thunderstorm, sir.'  'That is what they all say. It was at four o'clock. I got up and looked out at the window. The evening primroses were very beautiful.'  'I don't hold much with evening primroses, sir; but I was out and about at four; there was no thunderstorm.'  'I suppose I just thought there was one. Perhaps it was some thunderstorm of long ago that I heard. They do come back, you know.'  'Do they, sir?'  'I am glad to see you moving about in the garden, Dering, with everything just as usual.'  'Thank you, sir.'  'No, don't go. I am--a little troubled, Dering.'  'Everything be all right, sir.'  'I'm glad of that,' the Colonel says with relief. 'It is pleasant to see that you have come back, Dering. Why did you go away for such a long time?'  'Me, sir?' Dering is a little aggrieved. 'I haven't had a day off since Christmas.'  'Haven't you? I thought--'  'Is everything just as usual, Dering?'  'Yes, sir. There never were a place less changed than this.'  'That's true.' The Colonel is appeased. 'Thank you, Dering, for saying that.' But next moment he has lowered his voice again. 'Dering, there is nothing wrong, is there? Is anything happening that I am not being told about?'  'Not that I know of, sir.'  'That is what they all say, but--I don't know. Dering, I feel as if I was needed somewhere. I don't know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is every one?'  'They're all about, sir. There's a cricket match on at the village green.'  'Is there?'  'If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices. You were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.'  'Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggest score I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred, but I wouldn't let them. I was pretty good at steering them through the slips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didn't matter where point stood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.'  'That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snap you regular at point.'  'Did he? I daresay he did. I can't play now, but I like to watch it still.' 'Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I don't understand it, Dering. When I got there the green was all dotted with them--it's the prettiest sight and sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, one and two at a time; they weren't given out, you know, they went as if they had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--and then they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps were left lying about. Why is it?'  'It's just fancy, sir, I saw Master Will oiling his bat yesterday.'
EN237	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN236	1	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.
EN231	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$I did not then. I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of it on the ridge of his skull, and he went down at my feet like an empty sack, and never let a grunt or groan from him at all.  And what way weren't you hanged, mister? Did you bury him then?  Aye. I buried him then. Wasn't I digging spuds in the field?  And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that you're out?  Never a one of them, and I walking forward facing hog, dog, or divil on the highway of the road.  It's only with a common week-day kind of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase, and that man should be a great terror when his temper's roused.  He should then. And where was it, mister honey, that you did the deed?  Oh, a distant place, master of the house, a windy corner of high, distant hills.  He's a close man, and he's right, surely.  That'd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a pot-boy, Michael James, if it's the truth you're seeking one at all.  The peelers is fearing him, and if you'd that lad in the house there isn't one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard.  Bravery's a treasure in a lonesome place, and a lad would kill his father, I'm thinking, would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on the flags of hell.  It's the truth they're saying, and if I'd that lad in the house, I wouldn't be fearing the loosed kharki cut-throats, or the walking dead.  Well, glory be to God!  Would you think well to stop here and be pot-boy, mister honey, if we gave you good wages, and didn't destroy you with the weight of work?  That'd be a queer kind to bring into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike.  Will you whisht? Who's speaking to you?
EN230	0	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.
EN233	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'
EN232	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$You stick to me, Brocky, and I'll pull you through.  Monsieur Fleury.  The chef.  Very charmed to see you, Monsieur Fleury.  Thank you very much.  Agatha--recitation!

At last we meet. Won't you sit down?  Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Charmed to see you, Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Mr. Treherne, this is Fisher, my maid.  Your what, Mary?  My friend. Thomas.  How do you do, Thomas?  John.  How do you do, John?  Brocklehurst, this is John. I think you have already met on the door-step.  Jane.  Give me your hand, Jane.  Gladys.  How do you do, Gladys. You know my uncle?  Your hand, Gladys.  Tweeny.  So happy to see you.  John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce me.  That's an uncommon pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.  No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.  They are not all here, Crichton.  Odds and ends. Which is to recite?  And how are all at home?  Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?  No, no, the family. How's the baby?  Blooming, your lordship.  A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice little fellow.  Beg pardon, my lord, it's a girl.  A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.  Very delighted to see you, Crichton.  Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?  Milk and sugar, Crichton?  I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.  To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful. Oh, please do speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?  It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.  I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.  I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.  Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything?  I have no idea, my lady.  But you laughed.  My lady, he is the second son of a peer.  Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.

Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights.

Tell me, for thou art native of this place, What dost thou know about the King of Grace-- King of the Jews?   Aye, in Jerusalem He dwells, and not in Bethlehem. He sits upon his mighty judgment throne, Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.   I mean a new-born King, of love and peace; His is the star--His reign shall never cease.

And now you come with words of mystery! Why should thy questions, which are dark to me, Cause me to think of Him?   The star! The star! No more it moves about the heavens afar, It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray, For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!   His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within And seek protection in my humble inn.    Three kings came riding from far away, Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar; Three wise men out of the east were they, And they traveled by night and they slept by day, For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.   The star was so beautiful, large and clear, That all other stars of the sky Became a white mist in the atmosphere; And by this they knew that the coming was near Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.
EN335	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Come along with me now, lady of the house, and it's not my blather you'll be hearing only, but you'll be hearing the herons crying out over the black lakes, and you'll be hearing the grouse and the owls with them, and the larks and the big thrushes when the days are warm, and it's not from the like of them you'll be hearing a talk of getting old like Peggy Cavanagh, and losing the hair off you, and the light of your eyes, but it's fine songs you'll be hearing when the sun goes up, and there'll be no old fellow wheezing, the like of a sick sheep, close to your ear.  I'm thinking it's myself will be wheezing that time with lying down under the Heavens when the night is cold; but you've a fine bit of talk, stranger, and it's with yourself I'll go.  You think it's a grand thing you're after doing with your letting on to be dead, but what is it at all? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this place, and she not making a talk with the men passing? And what way will yourself live from this day, with none to care for you? What is it you'll have now but a black life, Daniel Burke, and it's not long I'm telling you, till you'll be lying again under that sheet, and you dead surely.  Sit down now and take a little taste of the stuff, Micheal Dara. There's a great drouth on me, and the night is young.  And it's very dry I am, surely, with the fear of death you put on me, and I after driving mountain ewes since the turn of the day.  I was thinking to strike you, Micheal Dara, but you're a quiet man, God help you, and I don't mind you at all.  Your good health, Micheal Dara.  God reward you, Daniel Burke, and may you have a long life, and a quiet life, and good health with it.
EN336	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night.  You should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and Spain.  We were great surely, with wide and windy acres of rich Munster land.  Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?  Is it me?  Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?  I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in the naked parish where I grew a man.  If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking, and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.  I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't fearing you at all.  You've said the like of that, maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.  I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine prancing women making laughter with the men.  If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.  You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you single now?  What would I want wedding so young?  We're alike, so.
EN337	1	Yes--and it's bad on dem like hell vorst of all. Dey don't see deir men only once in long while. Dey set and vait all 'lone.

I do feel sort of--nutty, to-night. I feel old.  Old?  Sure--like I'd been living a long, long time--out here in the fog. I don't know how to tell you yust what I mean. It's like I'd come home after a long visit away some place. It all seems like I'd been here before lots of times--on boats--in this same fog. You must think I'm off my base.  Anybody feel funny dat vay in fog.  But why d'you s'pose I feel so--so--like I'd found something I'd missed and been looking for--'s if this was the right place for me to fit in? And I seem to have forgot--everything that's happened--like it didn't matter no more. And I feel clean, somehow--like you feel yust after you've took a bath. And I feel happy for once--yes, honest!--happier than I ever been anywhere before! It's nutty for me to feel that way, don't you think?  Ay tank Ay'm damn fool for bring you on voyage, Anna.  You talk--nutty to-night yourself. You act's if you was scared something was going to happen.  CHRIS--Only God know dat, Anna.  Then it'll be Gawd's will, like the preachers say-what does happen.  No! Dat ole davil, sea, she ain't God! "Ahoy!"  What's that?  Py golly, dat scare me for minute. It's only some fallar hail, Anna--loose his course in fog. Must be fisherman's power boat.

You need it, I guess.$$$He's a hog on two legs.  You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.
EN239	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$Who's there?  Me.  Who's me?  The Widow Quin.  Go on now with your supper, and let on to be sleepy, for if she found you were such a warrant to talk, she'd be stringing gabble till the dawn of day.  What ails you, or what is it you're wanting at this hour of the night?  I'm after meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below, who told me of your curiosity man, and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring, romping on your hands with drink.  Look now is he roaring, and he stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk. Walk down and tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh.  I'll not see them again, for I've their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me.  This night, is it?  This night. "It isn't fitting," says the priesteen, "to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl."  God save you, mister!  God save you kindly.  Well, aren't you a little smiling fellow? It should have been great and bitter torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood.  It should, maybe.  It's more than "maybe" I'm saying, and it'd soften my heart to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake, and you fitter to be saying your catechism than slaying your da.  There's talking when any'd see he's fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world. Walk on from this, for I'll not have him tormented and he destroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week.  We'll be walking surely when his supper's done, and you'll find we're great company, young fellow, when it's of the like of you and me you'd hear the penny poets singing in an August Fair.  Did you kill your father?  She did not. She hit himself with a worn pick, and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never overed it, and died after. That was a sneaky kind of murder did win small glory with the boys itself.
EN331	0	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$Humph! He's original in that opinion.  I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.
EN332	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$'That movement again! Don't you want me to go on?'  'Let us stop.'  'Not unless he wishes it. Why are those words so important? Does the message end there? Is any one working against you? Some one antagonistic? Yes. Not one of ourselves surely? No. Is it any one we know? Yes. Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of this person's name A?--B?----'  'Is the second letter A?'  'FA. Fa----?'  'Is the word Father? Yes.'  'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'  'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'  'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly antagonistic, is he?'  'I am afraid he is.'  'But he must admit that we do get messages.'  'He says we think we do. He says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'  'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'  'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'  'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'  'He said it was.'  'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'  'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't thinking of it at all.'  'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'  'I'll go.'  'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'  'As to that--as to that----'  'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'  'No, don't.'  'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'  'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'  'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'  'You see, Dick and I were not very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'  'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'  'I'll go.'  'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'  'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'  'No, no, don't.'  'It would be all right, Don.'  'I don't know.'  'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel I--should like to be alone.'  'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'  'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening. I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'  'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather not. Thanks, awfully.'  'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'  'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'  'Dick's fishing-rods.'  'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'  'That's all right, Grace.'  'I think I shall go to Laura now.'  'Yes,'  'Poor child!'  'I'm afraid I hurt her.'  'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'  'Why not, Grace?'  'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father.'  'I daresay.'  'How you can read about the war nowadays!'  'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's just that I can't believe in it.'  'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was to me.'  'I don't know.'  'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'
EN333	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$Do not give way to this uncalled-for grief, Your separation will be very brief. To ascertain which is the King And which the other, To Barataria's Court I'll bring His foster-mother; Her former nurseling to declare She'll be delighted. That settled, let each happy pair Be reunited. Viva! His argument is strong! Viva! We'll not be parted long! Viva! It will be settled soon! Viva! Then comes our honeymoon!    Then one of us will be a Queen, And sit on a golden throne, With a crown instead Of a hat on her head, And diamonds all her own! With a beautiful robe of gold and green, I've always understood; I wonder whether She'd wear a feather? I rather think she should!  Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, To be a regular Royal Queen! No half-and-half affair, I mean, But a right-down regular Royal Queen!  She'll drive about in a carriage and pair, With the King on her left-hand side, And a milk-white horse, As a matter of course, Whenever she wants to ride! With beautiful silver shoes to wear Upon her dainty feet; With endless stocks Of beautiful frocks And as much as she wants to eat!  Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.  Whenever she condescends to walk, Be sure she'll shine at that, With her haughty stare And her nose in the air, Like a well-born aristocrat! At elegant high society talk She'll bear away the bell, With her "How de do?" And her "How are you?" And "I trust I see you well!"  ALL. Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.  GIU. And noble lords will scrape and bow, And double themselves in two, And open their eyes In blank surprise At whatever she likes to do. And everybody will roundly vow She's fair as flowers in May,

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.

You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.
EN169	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$In the regrettable slang of the servants' hall, my lady, the master is usually referred to as the Gov.  I see. You--  Yes, I understand that is what they call me.  You didn't even take your meals with the family?  No, my lady, I dined apart.  You, girl, also? Did you dine with Crichton?  No, your ladyship.  With whom?  I took my bit of supper with--with Daddy and Polly and the rest.  Dear old Daddy--he was our monkey. You remember our monkey, Agatha?  Rather! What a funny old darling he was.  And don't you think Polly was the sweetest little parrot, Mary?  Ah! I understand; animals you had domesticated?  Quite so--quite so.  The servants' teas that used to take place here once a month--  They did not seem natural on the island, my lady, and were discontinued by the Gov.'s orders.  A clear proof, Loam, that they were a mistake here.  I admit it frankly. I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I think of going over to the Tories.  I am delighted to hear it.  Thank you, Crichton, thank you; that is all.  One moment. Young people, Crichton, will be young people, even on an island; now, I suppose there was a certain amount of--shall we say sentimentalising, going on? Yes, my lady, there was.  Mother!  Which gentleman? You, girl, tell me.  If you please, my lady--  The fact is--  It was him--Mr. Ernest, your ladyship.  With which lady?  I have already told you, Lady Brocklehurst, that Ernest and I--  Yes, now; but you were two years on the island. Was it this lady?  No, your ladyship.  Then I don't care which of the others it was. Well, I suppose that will do.  Do! I hope you are ashamed of yourself, mother. You are an excellent fellow, Crichton; and if, after we are married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.  Oh no, impossible--  Why impossible? Do you see why it should be impossible, my man?  Yes, my lady. I had not told you, my lord, but as soon as your lordship is suited I wish to leave service.  What will you do, Crichton?  Shall I withdraw, my lord?  Horrid of me, wasn't it? But if one wasn't disagreeable now and again, it would be horribly tedious to be an old woman. He will soon be yours, Mary, and then--think of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to me. On that understanding, my dear, don't you think we might--?  Quite so--quite so. To wish you every dear happiness.  The same to you, my lady.  Do you despise me, Crichton? You are the best man among us.  On an island, my lady, perhaps; but in England, no.  Then there's something wrong with England.  My lady, not even from you can I listen to a word against England.  Tell me one thing: you have not lost your courage?  No, my lady.
EN399	0	Gawd, I can't stand this! I better beat it.  Well, who's the blond?  Dat vas Anna, Larry.  Your daughter, Anna?  Don't you tank she vas pooty gel, Larry?  Sure! A peach!  You bet you! Give me drink for take back--one port vine for Anna--she calabrate dis one time with me--and small beer for me.  Small beer for you, eh? She's reformin' you already.  You bet! You look tired, Anna. Veil, Ay make you take good long rest now. Come, you drink vine. It put new life in you. Skoal, Anna! You know dat Svedish word?  Skoal! Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!       Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.  Is it dead he is or living?  It's little you care if it's dead or living I am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead.

EN391	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$The tide, Crichton, is a postman who calls at our island twice a day for letters.  Thank you, sir.  Poor Crichton! I sometimes think he is losing his sense of humour. Come along, Agatha.  How horribly still it is.  It is best when it is still.  Mary, I have heard that they are always very still just before they jump.  Don't.  It is only Crichton knocking down trees.  Mary, let us go and stand beside him.  Let a servant see that I am afraid!  Don't, then; but remember this, dear, they often drop on one from above.  Crichton, Crichton!  Did you call, my lady?  I! Why should I?  I made a mistake, your ladyship. If you are afraid of being alone, my lady--  Afraid! Certainly not. You may go.  I wish, Crichton, you could work without getting so hot.  I wish I could, my lady.  It makes me hot to look at you.  It almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship.  Anything I can do for you in that way, Crichton, I shall do with pleasure.  Thank you, my lady.  Don't give way, my lady, things might be worse.  My poor father.  If I could have given my life for his.  You did all a man could do. Indeed I thank you, Crichton. You are a man.  Thank you, my lady.  But it is all so awful. Crichton, is there any hope of a ship coming?  Of course there is, my lady.  Don't treat me as a child. I have got to know the worst, and to face it. Crichton, the truth.  We were driven out of our course, my lady; I fear far from the track of commerce.  Thank you; I understand.  You're a good pluckt 'un, my lady.  I shall try to be. Crichton, how dare you?  I beg your ladyship's pardon; but you are.  And until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for you ladies.  Mr. Ernest does no work.  But he will, my lady.  I doubt it.  No work--no dinner--will make a great change in Mr. Ernest.  No work--no dinner. When did you invent that rule, Crichton?  I didn't invent it, my lady. I seem to see it growing all over the island.  Crichton, your manner strikes me as curious.  I hope not, your ladyship.  You are not implying anything so unnatural, I presume, as that if I and my sisters don't work there will be no dinner for us?  If it is unnatural, my lady, that is the end of it.  If? Now I understand. The perfect servant at home holds that we are all equal now. I see.  My lady, can you think me so inconsistent?  That is it.  My lady, I disbelieved in equality at home because it was against nature, and for that same reason I as utterly disbelieve in it on an island.  I apologise.  There must always, my lady, be one to command and others to obey.  One to command, others to obey. Yes. Crichton!  What is it, my lady?  Look what I found.  Cocoa-nuts. Bravo!  They grows on trees.  Where did you think they grew?  I thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks.
EN158	1	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up!

Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN159	0	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother.

In the first cell we have Senor Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old, to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds.

EN455	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint.

That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all the same mopin' and lazin' in it. It's the bad luck I've been havin' altogether this last year since your mother died. Who's to do the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. hat a fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a millionaire! Mary, dear, it's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most. What are you sniffin' at?  I was thinking--of Mamma.  It's late you are with your tears, and her cold in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!  Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself?  Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I beat him.  Slow poke!  You didn't beat me, neither!  I did, too!  You did not! You didn't play fair. You tripped me comin' up the steps. Brick-top! Cheater!  You're a liar! You stumbled over your own big feet, clumsy bones! And I beat you fair Didn't I, Papa?  You did, darlin', and fair, too. Sure it's you can beat the divil himself!  See? Liar!  Did you get the plug for me I told you?
EN454	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$'Yes, perhaps.'  'Good-night, Robert.'  'Good-night, dear.'  'Dick!'  'I have come to sit with you for a bit, father.'  'It's you, Dick; it's you!'  'It's me all right, father. I say, don't be startled, or anything of that kind. We don't like that.'  'My boy!'  'How am I looking, father?'  'You haven't altered, Dick.'  'Rather not. It's jolly to see the old studio again! I say, father, don't fuss. Let us be our ordinary selves, won't you?'  'I'll try, I'll try. You didn't say you had come to sit with me, Dick? Not with me!'  'Rather!'  'But your mother----'  'It's you I want.'  'Me?'  'We can only come to one, you see.'  'Then why me?'  'That's the reason. Hello, here's your old jacket, greasier than ever!'  'Me? But, Dick, it is as if you had forgotten. It was your mother who was everything to you. It can't be you if you have forgotten that. I used to feel so out of it; but, of course, you didn't know.'  'I didn't know it till lately, father; but heaps of things that I didn't know once are clear to me now. I didn't know that you were the one who would miss me most; but I know now.'  'Me miss you most? Dick, I try to paint just as before. I go to the club. Dick, I have been to a dinner-party. I said I wouldn't give in.'  'We like that.'  'But, my boy----'  'I say, father, let's get away from that sort of thing.'  'That is so like you, Dick! I'll do anything you ask.'  'Then keep a bright face.'  'I've tried to.'  'Good man! I say, put on your old greasy; you are looking so beastly clean.'  'Anything you like. No, that's the wrong sleeve. Thanks, Dick.'  'Here, let me shove you into your old seat.'  'How's that, umpire!'  'Dick, that's just how you used to butt me into it long ago!'  'When I was a kid.'  'With the palette in my hand.'  'Or sticking to your trousers.'  'The mess we made of ourselves, Dick.' 'I sneaked behind the settle and climbed up it.'  'Till you fell off.'  'On top of you and the palette.'  'Ah, Dick.'  'Now then, behave! What did I say about that face?'  'That's better. I'll sit here.'  'Got your pipe?'  'I don't--I don't seem to care to smoke nowadays, Dick.'  'Rot! Just because I am dead! You that pretend to be plucky! I won't have it, you know. You get your pipe, and look slippy about it.'  'Yes, Dick, Now, then, burn your thumb with the match--you always did, you know. That's the style. You've forgotten to cock your head to the side. Not so bad. That's you. Like it?'  'It's rather nice, Dick. Dick, you and me by the fire!'  'Yes, but sit still. How often we might have been like this, father, and weren't.'  'Ah!'  'Face. How is Fido?'  'Never a dog missed her master more.'  'Oh, She doesn't want to go and sit on my grave, or any of that tosh, does she? As if I were there!'  'No, no, she goes ratting, Dick.'  'Good old Fido!'  'Dick, here's a good one. We oughtn't to keep a dog at all because we are on rations now; but what do you think Fido ate yesterday?'
EN457	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$How is his lordship now?  A little easier, sir.  Crichton, send Fisher to me.  I have no pity for you girls, I--  Ernest, go away, and don't insult the broken-hearted.  And uncommon glad I am to go. Ta-ta, all of you. He asked me to say a few words. I came here to say a few words, and I'm not at all sure that I couldn't bring an action against him.  My poor sisters, come here. We must make this draw us closer together. I shall do my best to help you in every way. Just now I cannot think of myself at all.  But how unlike you, Mary.  It is my duty to protect my sisters.  I never knew her so sweet before, Agatha. (Cautiously.) What do you propose to do, Mary?  I propose when we are on the yacht to lend Fisher to you when I don't need her myself.  Fisher?  Of course, as the eldest, I have decided that it is my maid we shall take with us.  Mary, you toad.  Nothing on earth would induce Fisher to lift her hand for either me or Catherine.  I was afraid of it, Agatha. That is why I am so sorry for you.  Fisher, you heard what his lordship said?  Yes, my lady.  You have given me some satisfaction of late, Fisher, and to mark my approval I have decided that you shall be the maid who accompanies us.  I thank you, my lady.  That is all; you may go.  If you please, my lady, I wish to give notice.  Oh, certainly--you may go.  But why, Fisher?  I could not undertake, my lady, to wait upon three. We don't do it. Oh, my lady, to think that this affront--  I thought I told you to go, Fisher.  Serves you right.  It will be Simmons after all. Send Simmons to me.  My lady, might I venture to speak?  What is it?  I happen to know, your ladyship, that Simmons desires to give notice for the same reason as Fisher.  Oh!  Then, Catherine, we take Jeanne.  And Jeanne also, my lady.  We can't blame them. Could any maid who respected herself be got to wait upon three?  I suppose there are such persons, Crichton?  I have heard, my lady, that there are such.  Crichton, what's to be done? We sail in two days; could one be discovered in the time?  Surely you can think of some one?  There is in this establishment, your ladyship, a young woman--  Yes?  A young woman, on whom I have for some time cast an eye.  Do you mean as a possible lady's-maid?  I had thought of her, my lady, in another connection.  Ah!  But I believe she is quite the young person you require. Perhaps if you could see her, my lady--  I shall certainly see her. Bring her to me. You two needn't wait.  Needn't we? We see your little game, Mary.  We shall certainly remain and have our two-thirds of her.  This, my lady, is the young person.  Oh dear!  Come here, girl. Don't be afraid.  Her appearance, my lady, is homely, and her manners, as you may have observed, deplorable, but she has a heart of gold.  What is your position downstairs?  I'm a tweeny, your ladyship.  A what?  A tweeny; that is to say, my lady, she is not at present, strictly speaking, anything; a between maid; she helps the vegetable maid. It is she, my lady, who conveys the dishes from the one end of the kitchen table, where they are placed by the cook, to the other end, where they enter into the charge of Thomas and John.  I see. And you and Crichton are--ah--keeping company?  A butler don't keep company, my lady.  Does he not?  No, your ladyship, we butlers may--(he makes a gesture with his arms)--but we do not keep company.  I know what it is; you are engaged?

Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'  'Yes, it was to a wedding.'  'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'  'Tell me, Ellen.'  'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'  'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'  'I thought you might be a little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.'  'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'  'It _is_ funny, John. I ran back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.'  'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'  'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'  'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'  'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'  'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too old yet.'  'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.'  'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard nothing.'  'Dering?'  'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'  'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'  'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'  'They have all gone to the war, John.'  'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'  'Oh, John!'  'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'  'Yes, I know, John.'  He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes here. He is a captain.'  'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'  'She has soon forgotten.'  'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'  'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'  'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'  'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'  'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may even have killed each other.'  'They hadn't known, Ellen.'  'I daresay they knew.'  'Billy boy and Karl!'  'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'  'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'  'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'  'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here, John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'  'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'  'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.'  'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'  'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'  'No, no, let's pretend.'  'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little touchy about that.'  'Not a word!'  'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'  'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'  'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'  'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'  'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'  'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'  'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'
EN451	0	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$'Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things to do: and you, too, Barbara. They are leaving in an hour, John.'  'If you would like to take Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the garden.'  'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'  'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'  'But there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'  'Let me, dear,'  'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'  'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is. There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew, he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go to the alder pool, Barbara.'  'We won't go there, dear.'  'Did I do all right, Ellen?'  'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'  'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion! I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'  'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to you; you like that, don't you?'  'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No, I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'  'Barbara?'  'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'  'Which bit shall I read?'  'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.' 'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun to laugh already.'  'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'  'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish? Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'  'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'  'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'  'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but something prevents him.'  'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'  'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better. Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'  'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little light?'  'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it helps one to concentrate.'   'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you still there?'  'I think I felt a movement.'  'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'  'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'  'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'  'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'  'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'  'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with A?--with B? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the fourth word Welcome? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me Welcome.'

The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself?

Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not.

She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a sheep.  It's true the Lord God formed you to contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?  Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?  Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her pigsty and not plague us here.  I'm going; but he'll come with me.  Are you dumb, young fellow?  God increase you; but I'm pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.  Now you have heard him, and go on from this.  It's lonesome this hour crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.  Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will send you now.  Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.

EN150	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?
EN452	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself. Let you walk out throughthat door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's hungry you are, or wanting a bed.  Maybe himself would take her.  What would he do with me now?  Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth.  Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born yourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have surely.  We'll be going now, lady of the house--the rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning by the grace of God.  What good is a grand morning when I'm destroyed surely, and I going out to get my death walking the roads?  You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house, and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold, and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking on each day, and it passing you by. You'll be saying one time, "It's a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--  Go out of that door, I'm telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.
EN151	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'

Yust short time ago Ay got dis yob cause Ay vas sick, need open air.  Sick? You? You'd never think it.  And, Anna, dis ain't real sailor yob. Dis ain't real boat on sea.

Ay keep my word, py yingo!  Well, I can't see no difference. Speaking of being sick, I been there myself--yust out of the hospital two weeks ago.  You, Anna? Py golly! You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?

Ay love your mo'der too much for ever do dat, Anna.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--
EN472	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself?

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$There's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them, and he not reckoning them at all.  Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's gone?  It is surely.  That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath.  He was a great man surely, stranger, and isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man, and he mad dying?  It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.  I heard tell this day, Nora Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself.  It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.  I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in a lonesome place you live itself.  It's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men, for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day, Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.  Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man?  What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?

It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$'Yes, perhaps.'  'Good-night, Robert.'  'Good-night, dear.'  'Dick!'  'I have come to sit with you for a bit, father.'  'It's you, Dick; it's you!'  'It's me all right, father. I say, don't be startled, or anything of that kind. We don't like that.'  'My boy!'  'How am I looking, father?'  'You haven't altered, Dick.'  'Rather not. It's jolly to see the old studio again! I say, father, don't fuss. Let us be our ordinary selves, won't you?'  'I'll try, I'll try. You didn't say you had come to sit with me, Dick? Not with me!'  'Rather!'  'But your mother----'  'It's you I want.'  'Me?'  'We can only come to one, you see.'  'Then why me?'  'That's the reason. Hello, here's your old jacket, greasier than ever!'  'Me? But, Dick, it is as if you had forgotten. It was your mother who was everything to you. It can't be you if you have forgotten that. I used to feel so out of it; but, of course, you didn't know.'  'I didn't know it till lately, father; but heaps of things that I didn't know once are clear to me now. I didn't know that you were the one who would miss me most; but I know now.'  'Me miss you most? Dick, I try to paint just as before. I go to the club. Dick, I have been to a dinner-party. I said I wouldn't give in.'  'We like that.'  'But, my boy----'  'I say, father, let's get away from that sort of thing.'  'That is so like you, Dick! I'll do anything you ask.'  'Then keep a bright face.'  'I've tried to.'  'Good man! I say, put on your old greasy; you are looking so beastly clean.'  'Anything you like. No, that's the wrong sleeve. Thanks, Dick.'  'Here, let me shove you into your old seat.'  'How's that, umpire!'  'Dick, that's just how you used to butt me into it long ago!'  'When I was a kid.'  'With the palette in my hand.'  'Or sticking to your trousers.'  'The mess we made of ourselves, Dick.' 'I sneaked behind the settle and climbed up it.'  'Till you fell off.'  'On top of you and the palette.'  'Ah, Dick.'  'Now then, behave! What did I say about that face?'  'That's better. I'll sit here.'  'Got your pipe?'  'I don't--I don't seem to care to smoke nowadays, Dick.'  'Rot! Just because I am dead! You that pretend to be plucky! I won't have it, you know. You get your pipe, and look slippy about it.'  'Yes, Dick, Now, then, burn your thumb with the match--you always did, you know. That's the style. You've forgotten to cock your head to the side. Not so bad. That's you. Like it?'  'It's rather nice, Dick. Dick, you and me by the fire!'  'Yes, but sit still. How often we might have been like this, father, and weren't.'  'Ah!'  'Face. How is Fido?'  'Never a dog missed her master more.'  'Oh, She doesn't want to go and sit on my grave, or any of that tosh, does she? As if I were there!'  'No, no, she goes ratting, Dick.'  'Good old Fido!'  'Dick, here's a good one. We oughtn't to keep a dog at all because we are on rations now; but what do you think Fido ate yesterday?'
EN475	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.

Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of this person's name A?--B?----'  'Is the second letter A?'  'FA. Fa----?'  'Is the word Father? Yes.'  'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'  'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'  'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly antagonistic, is he?'  'I am afraid he is.'  'But he must admit that we do get messages.'  'He says we think we do. He says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'  'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'  'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'  'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'  'He said it was.'  'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'  'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't thinking of it at all.'  'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'  'I'll go.'  'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'  'As to that--as to that----'  'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'  'No, don't.'  'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'  'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'  'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'  'You see, Dick and I were not very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'  'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'  'I'll go.'  'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'  'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'  'No, no, don't.'  'It would be all right, Don.'  'I don't know.'  'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel I--should like to be alone.'  'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'  'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening. I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'  'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather not. Thanks, awfully.'  'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'  'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'  'Dick's fishing-rods.'  'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'  'That's all right, Grace.'  'I think I shall go to Laura now.'  'Yes,'  'Poor child!'  'I'm afraid I hurt her.'  'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'  'Why not, Grace?'  'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father.'  'I daresay.'  'How you can read about the war nowadays!'  'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's just that I can't believe in it.'  'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was to me.'  'I don't know.'  'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'
EN479	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$'I'll try not to,'  'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong about me.'  'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN478	0	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN198	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$If we did, my lady, the first thing we should do would be to elect a head. Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?
EN199	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Of the child that is born, O Baltasar, I begged a woman to tell us the news; I said in the east we had seen His star, And had ridden fast and had ridden far To find and worship the King of the Jews.  Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star Is standing still over this lowly hut.  Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!  What ho, within!  Sirs, whom seek ye?   We have journeyed from afar Led by the shining of yon splendid star. We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.   We seek a new-born King, Gold, frankincense to him we bring. And many a kingly offering.  Behold, the child is clothed in light!   Our journey ends, passed is the night.   Now let us make no more delay, But worship Him right worthily.   Hail, hail, dear child Of a maiden meek and mild. See, he merries! See, he smiles, my sweeting, I give thee greeting! Have a bob of cherries.   Hail, little One we've sought, See, a bird I've brought, See its feathers gay. Hail, little One adored, Hail, blessed King and Lord, Star of the day!   Hail, little One, so dear, My heart is full of cheer, A little ball I bring, Reach forth thy fingers gay, And take the ball and play, My blessed King. I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings, And here a scepter full of gems, For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!   And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    The greatest gift is yet ungiven, The gift that cometh straight from Heaven. O, Heavenly King, Heart's love we bring.   Not gold nor gems from land or sea Is worth the love we offer Thee.   And lowly folk who have no gold, Nor gift to offer that is meet, May bring the dearest thing of all-- A loving heart and service sweet.
EN053	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$I did not then. I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of it on the ridge of his skull, and he went down at my feet like an empty sack, and never let a grunt or groan from him at all.  And what way weren't you hanged, mister? Did you bury him then?  Aye. I buried him then. Wasn't I digging spuds in the field?  And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that you're out?  Never a one of them, and I walking forward facing hog, dog, or divil on the highway of the road.  It's only with a common week-day kind of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase, and that man should be a great terror when his temper's roused.  He should then. And where was it, mister honey, that you did the deed?  Oh, a distant place, master of the house, a windy corner of high, distant hills.  He's a close man, and he's right, surely.  That'd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a pot-boy, Michael James, if it's the truth you're seeking one at all.  The peelers is fearing him, and if you'd that lad in the house there isn't one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard.  Bravery's a treasure in a lonesome place, and a lad would kill his father, I'm thinking, would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on the flags of hell.  It's the truth they're saying, and if I'd that lad in the house, I wouldn't be fearing the loosed kharki cut-throats, or the walking dead.  Well, glory be to God!  Would you think well to stop here and be pot-boy, mister honey, if we gave you good wages, and didn't destroy you with the weight of work?  That'd be a queer kind to bring into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike.  Will you whisht? Who's speaking to you?

What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before.

EN055	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$Oh Tweeny, Tweeny!  Have I offended of your feelings again, sir?  A little.  I'm full o' vulgar words and ways; and though I may keep them in their holes when you are by, as soon as I'm by myself out they comes in a rush like beetles when the house is dark. I says them gloating-like, in my head--'Blooming' I says, and 'All my eye,' and 'Ginger,' and 'Nothink'; and all the time we was being wrecked I was praying to myself, 'Please the Lord it may be an island as it's natural to be vulgar on.'  That's the kind I am, sir. I'm 'opeless. You'd better give me up.  I won't give you up. It is strange that one so common should attract one so fastidious; but so it is. There is something about you, Tweeny, there is a je ne sais quoi about you.  Is there, is there? Oh, I am glad.  We shall fight your vulgarity together. (All this time he has been arranging sticks for his fire.) Now get some dry grass. (She brings him grass, and he puts it under the sticks. He produces an odd lens from his pocket, and tries to focus the sun's rays.)  Why, what's that?  That's the glass from my watch and one from Mr. Treherne's, with a little water between them. I'm hoping to kindle a fire with it.  Oh sir!  Danger! Crichton, a tiger-cat!  Where?  It is at our heels.  Look out, Crichton.  H'sh!  It will be on us in a moment. Listen!  The grass is moving. It's coming.  Father.  Mary--Catherine--Agatha. Oh dear, my dears, my dears, oh dear!  Darling.  Sweetest.  Love.  Glad to see you, sir.  Uncle, uncle, dear old uncle.  Ernest thought you were a tiger-cat.  Oh, did you? I knew you at once, Ernest; I knew you by the way you ran.  My lord, I am glad.  But you are also idling, Crichton. We mustn't waste time. To work, to work.  Yes, sir.  Ernest, you be a little more civil. Crichton, let me help.  Is that--but I suppose I'm dreaming again. It isn't by any chance a pot on top of a fire, is it?  Indeed, it is, dearest. It is our supper.  I have been dreaming of a pot on a fire for two days. There 's nothing in it, is there?  Sniff, uncle.  It smells of onions!  Father, you have boots!  So he has.  Of course I have.  You are actually wearing boots, uncle. It's very unsafe, you know, in this climate.  Is it?  We have all abandoned them, you observe. The blood, the arteries, you know.  I hadn't a notion.  O Lord, yes.  Father, he is trying to get your boots from you. There is nothing in the world we wouldn't give for boots.  I only wanted the loan of them.  If you lend them to any one, it will be to us, won't it, father.  Certainly, my child.  Oh, very well. I don't want your old boots. You don't think you could spare me one boot?  I do not.  Quite so. Well, all I can say is I'm sorry for you.  Father, we thought we should never see you again.  I was washed ashore, my dear, clinging to a hencoop. How awful that first night was.  Poor father.  When I woke, I wept. Then I began to feel extremely hungry. There was a large turtle on the beach. I remembered from the Swiss Family Robinson that if you turn a turtle over he is helpless. My dears, I crawled towards him, I flung myself upon him the nasty, spiteful brute.
EN054	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?
EN057	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road, and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.  Providence and Mercy, spare us all!  It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.  I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?  The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.  Well, you should have been a queer lot. I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more years of age.  Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a Tuesday and halve his skull.  Well, you'll have peace in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.  It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in me and bravery of...  Oh, glory! it's late for knocking, and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.
EN056	0	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$'I have come back, John, It hasn't seemed very long, has it?'  'No, not long, Ellen. Had you a nice walk?'  'I haven't been for a walk. Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'  'Yes, it was to a wedding.'  'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'  'Tell me, Ellen.'  'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'  'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'  'I thought you might be a little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.'  'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'  'It _is_ funny, John. I ran back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.'  'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'  'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'  'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'  'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'  'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too old yet.'  'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.'  'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard nothing.'  'Dering?'  'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'  'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'  'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'  'They have all gone to the war, John.'  'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'  'Oh, John!'  'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'  'Yes, I know, John.'  He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes here. He is a captain.'  'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'  'She has soon forgotten.'  'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'  'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'  'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'  'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'  'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may even have killed each other.'  'They hadn't known, Ellen.'  'I daresay they knew.'  'Billy boy and Karl!'  'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'  'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'  'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'  'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here, John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'  'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'  'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.'  'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'  'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'  'No, no, let's pretend.'  'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little touchy about that.'  'Not a word!'  'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'  'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'  'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'  'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'  'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'  'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'  'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'
EN190	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned. Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?  What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
EN191	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--
EN192	0	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'
EN193	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself.

Is it dead he is or living?  It's little you care if it's dead or living I am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead. Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half in your skin.

EN195	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$A bloody-handed murderer the like of...  Whisht I am saying; we'll take no fooling from your like at all.And you, young fellow, you'd have a right to stop, I'm thinking, for we'd do our all and utmost to content your needs.  And I'd be safe in this place from the searching law?  You would, surely. If they're not fearing you, itself, the peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows, wouldn't touch a cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night.  Let you stop a short while anyhow. Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.  It's a nice room, and if it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.  Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door, and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk at the wake.  And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?  Christopher Mahon.  Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.  God bless you all.  God bless you.  Are you wanting me to stop along with you and keep you from harm?  Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?  There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it too.  You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step off nimble this time when there's none.  Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...  Go on, then, to Father Reilly, and let him put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.  If I meet the Widow Quin...  Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your noise. That lad would wear the spirits from the saints of peace. timidly. Then she comes to him and speaks with bland good-humour.) Let you stretch out now by the fire, young fellow. You should be destroyed travelling.
EN196	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road, and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.  Providence and Mercy, spare us all!  It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.  I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?  The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.  Well, you should have been a queer lot. I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more years of age.  Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a Tuesday and halve his skull.  Well, you'll have peace in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.  It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in me and bravery of...  Oh, glory! it's late for knocking, and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.
EN197	0	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'
EN370	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$The tide, Crichton, is a postman who calls at our island twice a day for letters.  Thank you, sir.  Poor Crichton! I sometimes think he is losing his sense of humour. Come along, Agatha.  How horribly still it is.  It is best when it is still.  Mary, I have heard that they are always very still just before they jump.  Don't.  It is only Crichton knocking down trees.  Mary, let us go and stand beside him.  Let a servant see that I am afraid!  Don't, then; but remember this, dear, they often drop on one from above.  Crichton, Crichton!  Did you call, my lady?  I! Why should I?  I made a mistake, your ladyship. If you are afraid of being alone, my lady--  Afraid! Certainly not. You may go.  I wish, Crichton, you could work without getting so hot.  I wish I could, my lady.  It makes me hot to look at you.  It almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship.  Anything I can do for you in that way, Crichton, I shall do with pleasure.  Thank you, my lady.  Don't give way, my lady, things might be worse.  My poor father.  If I could have given my life for his.  You did all a man could do. Indeed I thank you, Crichton. You are a man.  Thank you, my lady.  But it is all so awful. Crichton, is there any hope of a ship coming?  Of course there is, my lady.  Don't treat me as a child. I have got to know the worst, and to face it. Crichton, the truth.  We were driven out of our course, my lady; I fear far from the track of commerce.  Thank you; I understand.  You're a good pluckt 'un, my lady.  I shall try to be. Crichton, how dare you?  I beg your ladyship's pardon; but you are.  And until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for you ladies.  Mr. Ernest does no work.  But he will, my lady.  I doubt it.  No work--no dinner--will make a great change in Mr. Ernest.  No work--no dinner. When did you invent that rule, Crichton?  I didn't invent it, my lady. I seem to see it growing all over the island.  Crichton, your manner strikes me as curious.  I hope not, your ladyship.  You are not implying anything so unnatural, I presume, as that if I and my sisters don't work there will be no dinner for us?  If it is unnatural, my lady, that is the end of it.  If? Now I understand. The perfect servant at home holds that we are all equal now. I see.  My lady, can you think me so inconsistent?  That is it.  My lady, I disbelieved in equality at home because it was against nature, and for that same reason I as utterly disbelieve in it on an island.  I apologise.  There must always, my lady, be one to command and others to obey.  One to command, others to obey. Yes. Crichton!  What is it, my lady?  Look what I found.  Cocoa-nuts. Bravo!  They grows on trees.  Where did you think they grew?  I thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks.
EN371	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$Six yards of stuff for to make a yellow gown. A pair of lace boots with lengthy heels on them and brassy eyes. A hat is suited for a wedding-day. A fine tooth comb. To be sent with three barrels of porter in Jimmy Farrell's creel cart on the evening of the coming Fair to Mister Michael James Flaherty. With the best compliments of this season. Margaret Flaherty.  Where's himself?  He's coming. To Mister Sheamus Mulroy, Wine and Spirit Dealer, Castlebar.  I didn't see him on the road.  How would you see him and is dark night this half hour gone by?  I stood a while outside wondering would I have a right to pass on or to walk in and see you,  and I could hear the cows breathing, and sighing in the stillness of the air, and not a step moving any place from this gate to the bridge.  It's above at the cross-roads he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him to Kate Cassidy's wake.  And he's going that length in the dark night?  He is surely, and leaving me lonesome on the scruff of the hill. Isn't it long the nights are now, Shawn Keogh, to be leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of day?  If it is, when we're wedded in a short while you'll have no call to complain, for I've little will to be walking off to wakes or weddings in the darkness of the night.  You're making mighty certain, Shaneen, that I'll wed you now.  Aren't we after making a good bargain, the way we're only waiting these days on Father Reilly's dispensation from the bishops, or the Court of Rome.
EN372	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a sheep.  It's true the Lord God formed you to contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?  Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?  Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her pigsty and not plague us here.  I'm going; but he'll come with me.  Are you dumb, young fellow?  God increase you; but I'm pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.  Now you have heard him, and go on from this.  It's lonesome this hour crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.  Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will send you now.  Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.  What's that she's after saying?

Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn. Were you off east, young fellow, fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the Boers?  I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week.  He's done nothing, so. If you didn't commit murder or a bad, nasty thing, or false coining, or robbery, or butchery, or the like of them, there isn't anything that would be worth your troubling for to run from now. You did nothing at all.  That's an unkindly thing to be saying to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging before, and hell's gap gaping below.  You're only saying it. You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the windpipe of a screeching sow.  You're not speaking the truth.  Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?  Don't strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the like of that.  Is it killed your father?  With the help of God I did surely, and that the Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.  There's a daring fellow.  Oh, glory be to God!  That was a hanging crime, mister honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.  He was a dirty man, God forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up with him at all.  And you shot him dead?  I never used weapons. I've no license, and I'm a law-fearing man.  It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world it's bloody knives they use.  Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?  You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers swearing it had life?
EN374	1	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was courting each other just like the rest of yeez.  Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.  Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at him?  Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez are. Will you look at the red color in his face?  If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.  Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's a fine girl, if I do say it myself.  Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain to spake her piece.  LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.  Blessed old Santa Claus, king of delights, What are you doing these long winter nights? Filling your budgets with trinkets and toys, Wonderful gifts for the girls and the boys. While you are planning for everything nice, Pray let me give you a bit of advice.  Don't take it hard if I say in your ear, Santa, I thought you were partial last year; Loading the rich folks with everything gay, Snubbing the poor ones who came in your way. Now of all times of the year I am sure This is the time to remember the poor.
EN375	0	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$'I'll try not to,'  'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong about me.'  'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN376	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$Oh Tweeny, Tweeny!  Have I offended of your feelings again, sir?  A little.  I'm full o' vulgar words and ways; and though I may keep them in their holes when you are by, as soon as I'm by myself out they comes in a rush like beetles when the house is dark. I says them gloating-like, in my head--'Blooming' I says, and 'All my eye,' and 'Ginger,' and 'Nothink'; and all the time we was being wrecked I was praying to myself, 'Please the Lord it may be an island as it's natural to be vulgar on.'  That's the kind I am, sir. I'm 'opeless. You'd better give me up.  I won't give you up. It is strange that one so common should attract one so fastidious; but so it is. There is something about you, Tweeny, there is a je ne sais quoi about you.  Is there, is there? Oh, I am glad.  We shall fight your vulgarity together. (All this time he has been arranging sticks for his fire.) Now get some dry grass. (She brings him grass, and he puts it under the sticks. He produces an odd lens from his pocket, and tries to focus the sun's rays.)  Why, what's that?  That's the glass from my watch and one from Mr. Treherne's, with a little water between them. I'm hoping to kindle a fire with it.  Oh sir!  Danger! Crichton, a tiger-cat!  Where?  It is at our heels.  Look out, Crichton.  H'sh!  It will be on us in a moment. Listen!  The grass is moving. It's coming.  Father.  Mary--Catherine--Agatha. Oh dear, my dears, my dears, oh dear!  Darling.  Sweetest.  Love.  Glad to see you, sir.  Uncle, uncle, dear old uncle.  Ernest thought you were a tiger-cat.  Oh, did you? I knew you at once, Ernest; I knew you by the way you ran.  My lord, I am glad.  But you are also idling, Crichton. We mustn't waste time. To work, to work.  Yes, sir.  Ernest, you be a little more civil. Crichton, let me help.  Is that--but I suppose I'm dreaming again. It isn't by any chance a pot on top of a fire, is it?  Indeed, it is, dearest. It is our supper.  I have been dreaming of a pot on a fire for two days. There 's nothing in it, is there?  Sniff, uncle.  It smells of onions!  Father, you have boots!  So he has.  Of course I have.  You are actually wearing boots, uncle. It's very unsafe, you know, in this climate.  Is it?  We have all abandoned them, you observe. The blood, the arteries, you know.  I hadn't a notion.  O Lord, yes.  Father, he is trying to get your boots from you. There is nothing in the world we wouldn't give for boots.  I only wanted the loan of them.  If you lend them to any one, it will be to us, won't it, father.  Certainly, my child.  Oh, very well. I don't want your old boots. You don't think you could spare me one boot?  I do not.  Quite so. Well, all I can say is I'm sorry for you.  Father, we thought we should never see you again.  I was washed ashore, my dear, clinging to a hencoop. How awful that first night was.  Poor father.  When I woke, I wept. Then I began to feel extremely hungry. There was a large turtle on the beach. I remembered from the Swiss Family Robinson that if you turn a turtle over he is helpless. My dears, I crawled towards him, I flung myself upon him the nasty, spiteful brute.
EN377	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.
EN378	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself. Let you walk out throughthat door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's hungry you are, or wanting a bed.  Maybe himself would take her.  What would he do with me now?  Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth.  Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born yourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have surely.  We'll be going now, lady of the house--the rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning by the grace of God.  What good is a grand morning when I'm destroyed surely, and I going out to get my death walking the roads?  You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house, and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold, and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking on each day, and it passing you by. You'll be saying one time, "It's a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--  Go out of that door, I'm telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.
EN379	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$'Did you? I should have liked to see that. I have often oiled their bats for them. Careless lads, they always forget. Was that nice German boy with him?'  'Mr. Karl? Not far off, sir. He was sitting by the bank of the stream playing on his flute; and Miss Barbara, she had climbed one of my apple-trees,--she says they are your trees.'  'They are, you know, Dering,'  'Yes, sir, in a sense, but I don't like any of you to meddle with them. And there she sat, pelting the two of them with green apples.'  'How like her! I don't know how we are to make a demure young lady of her.'  'They say in the village, sir, that Master Will would like to try.'  'Ha! ha! he is just a colt himself. Who are all here now, Dering; in the house, I mean? I sometimes forget. They grow old so quickly. They go out at one door in the bloom of youth, and come back by another, tired and grey. Haven't you noticed it?'  'No, sir. The only visitors staying here are Miss Barbara and Mr. Karl. There's just them and yourselves, sir, you and the mistress and Master Will. That's all.'  'Yes, that's all,' his master says, still unconvinced. 'Who is the soldier, Dering?'  'Soldier, sir? There is no soldier here except yourself.'  'Isn't there? There was a nurse with him. Who is ill?'  'No one, sir. There's no nurse.' Dering backs away from the old man. Would you like me to call the mistress, sir?'  'No, she has gone down to the village. She told me why, but I forget. Miss Barbara is with her.'  'Miss Barbara is down by the stream, sir.'  'Is she? I think they said they were going to a wedding. Who is being married to-day, Dering?'  'I have heard of no wedding, sir. But here is Miss Barbara.'  'Here's the tomboy!'  'Dering, I believe you are complaining to the Colonel about my watering the flowers at the wrong time of day.''Aha! Aha!'  'I did just mention it, miss.'  'You horrid! Dear, don't mind him. And every time he says they are his flowers and his apples, you tell me, and I shall say to his face that they are yours.'  'The courage of those young things!'  'Let me make you comfy--the way granny does it.'  'That is not quite the way she does it, Do you call her granny, Barbara?'  'She asked me to--for practice. Don't you remember why?'  'I know! Billy boy.'  'You are quick today. Now, wait till I get your cane.'  'I don't need my cane while I'm sitting.'  'You look so beau'ful, sitting holding your cane. Oh dear! I am a clumsy.'  Not at all, but perhaps if I were to do it for myself. That's better. Thank you, Barbara, very much.'  'I didn't do it. I'm all thumbs. What a ghastly nurse I should make.'  'Nurse? Who is she, Barbara?'  'Who is who, dear?'  'That nurse.'  'There's no nurse here.'  'Isn't there?'  'Where is granny?'  'She has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'There's no wedding. Who could be being married?'  'I think it's people I know, but I can't remember who they are. I thought you went too, Barbara.'  'Not I. Catch me missing it if there had been a wedding!'  'You and the nurse.'  'Dear, you have just been imagining things again. Shall I play to you, or sing? Oh dear, everything catches in me. Would you like me to "Robin Adair," dear?'  'No, thank you, Barbara. Barbara, the house seems so empty. Where are Billy and Karl?'  'Billy is where Karl is, you may be sure.'  'And where is Karl?'  'He is where Billy boy is, you may be sure.'  'And where are they both?'  'Not far from where Barbara is, you bet. Do you hear Karl's flute? They have been down all the morning at the pool where the alder is, trying to catch that bull-trout.'  'They didn't get him, I'll swear!'  'You can ask them.'  'I spent a lot of my youth trying to get that bull-trout. I tumbled in there sixty years ago.'  'I tumbled in sixty minutes ago! It can't be the same trout, dear.'  'Same old rascal!'  'You muddy things!'  'Did you get the bull-trout, Billy boy?'  'He's a brute that.'  'He is, you know.'  BILLY. 'He came up several times and had a look at my fly. Didn't flick it, or do anything as complimentary as that. Just yawned and went down.'  COLONEL. 'Yawned, did he? Used to wink in my time. Did you and Billy fish at Heidelberg, Karl?'  KARL. 'We were more worthily employed, sir, but we did unbend at times. Billy, do you remember--' He begins a gay dance.

And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."
EN177	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?  Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big, tall little girl.  A great, big tall little girl, hey?  And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.  Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?  And so do I.  And so do you, hey?  Yes, sir; that is our wish.  Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.  You said you could give us anything we wished for.  But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine. Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll see what I can do for you.
EN174	1	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$Of the child that is born, O Baltasar, I begged a woman to tell us the news; I said in the east we had seen His star, And had ridden fast and had ridden far To find and worship the King of the Jews.  Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star Is standing still over this lowly hut.  Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!  What ho, within!  Sirs, whom seek ye?   We have journeyed from afar Led by the shining of yon splendid star. We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.   We seek a new-born King, Gold, frankincense to him we bring. And many a kingly offering.  Behold, the child is clothed in light!   Our journey ends, passed is the night.   Now let us make no more delay, But worship Him right worthily.   Hail, hail, dear child Of a maiden meek and mild. See, he merries! See, he smiles, my sweeting, I give thee greeting! Have a bob of cherries.   Hail, little One we've sought, See, a bird I've brought, See its feathers gay. Hail, little One adored, Hail, blessed King and Lord, Star of the day!   Hail, little One, so dear, My heart is full of cheer, A little ball I bring, Reach forth thy fingers gay, And take the ball and play, My blessed King. I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings, And here a scepter full of gems, For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!   And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    The greatest gift is yet ungiven, The gift that cometh straight from Heaven. O, Heavenly King, Heart's love we bring.   Not gold nor gems from land or sea Is worth the love we offer Thee.   And lowly folk who have no gold, Nor gift to offer that is meet, May bring the dearest thing of all-- A loving heart and service sweet.
EN175	1	She hasn't come yet, is it, and it falling to the night?  She has not. . . It's dark with the clouds are coming from the west and south, but it isn't later than the common.  It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not. Would you have him see you, and he a man would be jealous of a hawk would fly between her and the rising sun.

There'll be trouble this night, for he should be in his tempers from the way he's stepping out, and he swinging his hands.  wearied with the whole matter. -- It'd be best of all, maybe, if he got in tempers with herself, and made an end quickly, for I'm in a poor way between the pair of them. There they are now at the door.  The gods save you.  getting up and courtesy-ing. -- The gods save and keep you kindly, and stand between you and all harm for ever.  Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.  She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and put it in the presses within.  sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?  The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain. The silver skillets and the golden cups we have beyond locked in the chest.  Bring them out and use them from this day.  We'll do it, Conchubor.  getting up and going to frame. -- Is this hers?  pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."
EN172	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother. I was just like her when I was that age.  And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.  Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I think the show is about to begin. Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical! Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical! Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks! Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks! Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled, Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld, The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man, Aerial Artists from far-off Japan, Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun, Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!  Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old, to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcel post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife.
EN173	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'

My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$'I have come back, John, It hasn't seemed very long, has it?'  'No, not long, Ellen. Had you a nice walk?'  'I haven't been for a walk. Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'  'Yes, it was to a wedding.'  'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'  'Tell me, Ellen.'  'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'  'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'  'I thought you might be a little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.'  'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'  'It _is_ funny, John. I ran back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.'  'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'  'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'  'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'  'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'  'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too old yet.'  'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.'  'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard nothing.'  'Dering?'  'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'  'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'  'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'  'They have all gone to the war, John.'  'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'  'Oh, John!'  'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'  'Yes, I know, John.'  He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes here. He is a captain.'  'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'  'She has soon forgotten.'  'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'  'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'  'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'  'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'  'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may even have killed each other.'  'They hadn't known, Ellen.'  'I daresay they knew.'  'Billy boy and Karl!'  'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'  'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'  'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'  'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here, John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'  'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'  'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.'  'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'  'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'  'No, no, let's pretend.'  'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little touchy about that.'  'Not a word!'  'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'  'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'  'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'  'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'  'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'  'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'  'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'
EN171	1	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was courting each other just like the rest of yeez.  Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.  Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at him?  Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez are. Will you look at the red color in his face?  If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.  Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's a fine girl, if I do say it myself.  Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain to spake her piece.  LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.  Blessed old Santa Claus, king of delights, What are you doing these long winter nights? Filling your budgets with trinkets and toys, Wonderful gifts for the girls and the boys. While you are planning for everything nice, Pray let me give you a bit of advice.  Don't take it hard if I say in your ear, Santa, I thought you were partial last year; Loading the rich folks with everything gay, Snubbing the poor ones who came in your way. Now of all times of the year I am sure This is the time to remember the poor.

He always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.  Is it dead he is or living?  It's little you care if it's dead or living I am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead. Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half in your skin.
EN270	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'
EN273	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee Peter Pan.  I am that.

Mr. Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan as natural as life and twice as handsome.  Here's a doll baby I've dressed, but it's no head she has at all, at all.

Stick in some buttons for eyes, and a wee nose and mouth of red paper--and stick the head on the body with some hair pins, and the quane herself niver had a better doll baby.  I'll put her right here on the table alongside of the iliphant.  It's nine o'clock, it is. Isn't it time for the children to be home?  It is that. And here they come now.

Don't you know me, Annie?  You said--you was agoin' mad--God!  Whales, sir--a whole school of 'em--off the star-b'd quarter 'bout five miles away--big ones!  Are you lowerin' the boats?  MATE. Yes, sir.  I'm acomin' with ye.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir. You'll git the ile now right enough, sir.  Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git the ile. [I know you're foolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind--be you? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while longer, Annie--then we'll turn home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?  All ready, sir.  Comin', sir?$$$It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself. Let you walk out throughthat door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's hungry you are, or wanting a bed.  Maybe himself would take her.  What would he do with me now?  Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth.  Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born yourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have surely.  We'll be going now, lady of the house--the rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning by the grace of God.  What good is a grand morning when I'm destroyed surely, and I going out to get my death walking the roads?  You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house, and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold, and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking on each day, and it passing you by. You'll be saying one time, "It's a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--  Go out of that door, I'm telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.
EN275	1	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$He's a hog on two legs.  You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.
EN274	0	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$'I have come back, John, It hasn't seemed very long, has it?'  'No, not long, Ellen. Had you a nice walk?'  'I haven't been for a walk. Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'  'Yes, it was to a wedding.'  'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'  'Tell me, Ellen.'  'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'  'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'  'I thought you might be a little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.'  'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'  'It _is_ funny, John. I ran back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.'  'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'  'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'  'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'  'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'  'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too old yet.'  'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.'  'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard nothing.'  'Dering?'  'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'  'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'  'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'  'They have all gone to the war, John.'  'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'  'Oh, John!'  'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'  'Yes, I know, John.'  He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes here. He is a captain.'  'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'  'She has soon forgotten.'  'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'  'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'  'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'  'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'  'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may even have killed each other.'  'They hadn't known, Ellen.'  'I daresay they knew.'  'Billy boy and Karl!'  'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'  'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'  'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'  'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here, John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'  'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'  'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.'  'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'  'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'  'No, no, let's pretend.'  'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little touchy about that.'  'Not a word!'  'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'  'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'  'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'  'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'  'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'  'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'  'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'
EN178	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?  Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big, tall little girl.  A great, big tall little girl, hey?  And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.  Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?  And so do I.  And so do you, hey?  Yes, sir; that is our wish.  Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.  You said you could give us anything we wished for.  But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine. Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll see what I can do for you.

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself?

Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not.

Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all.

It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.

Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road, and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.  Providence and Mercy, spare us all!  It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.  I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?  The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.  Well, you should have been a queer lot. I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more years of age.  Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a Tuesday and halve his skull.  Well, you'll have peace in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.  It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in me and bravery of...  Oh, glory! it's late for knocking, and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.
EN285	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road, and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.

EN286	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned. Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?  What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
EN287	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$I perceive, from the tea cups, Crichton, that the great function is to take place here.  Yes, sir.  The servants' hall coming up to have tea in the drawing-room! No wonder you look happy, Crichton.  No, sir.  Do you know, Crichton, I think that with an effort you might look even happier. You don't approve of his lordship's compelling his servants to be his equals--once a month?  It is not for me, sir, to disapprove of his lordship's radical views.  Certainly not. And, after all, it is only once a month that he is affable to you.  On all other days of the month, sir, his lordship's treatment of us is everything that could be desired. Tea cups! Life, Crichton, is like a cup of tea; the more heartily we drink, the sooner we reach the dregs.  Thank you, sir.  as we do when we have need of an ally). Crichton, in case I should be asked to say a few words to the servants, I have strung together a little speech. I was wondering where I should stand.  with the best intentions, gives him a footstool to stand on, and departs, happily unconscious that ERNEST in some dudgeon has kicked the footstool across the room.)  Suppose you were all little fishes at the bottom of the sea  And how are my little friends to-day?  Don't be silly, Ernest. If you want to know how we are, we are dead. Even to think of entertaining the servants is so exhausting.  Besides which, we have had to decide what frocks to take with us on the yacht, and that is such a mental strain.  You poor over-worked things. Rest your weary limbs.  But why have you a footstool in your hand?  Yes?  Why? You see, as the servants are to be the guests I must be butler. I was practising. This is a tray, observe.  Tea, my lady? It is only you, Ernest; I thought there was some one here.  Had a very tiring day also, Mary?  Dreadfully. Been trying on engagement-rings all the morning.  What's that? Is it Brocklehurst?  You have given your warm young heart to Brocky?  I don't wish to fatigue you, Mary, by insisting on a verbal answer, but if, without straining yourself, you can signify Yes or No, won't you make the effort?  The ring! Then I am too late, too late! (Fixing LADY MARY sternly, like a prosecuting counsel.) May I ask, Mary, does Brocky know? Of course, it was that terrible mother of his who pulled this through. Mother does everything for Brocky. Still, in the eyes of the law you will be, not her wife, but his, and, therefore, I hold that Brocky ought to be informed. Now--  If you girls are shamming sleep in the expectation that I shall awaken you in the manner beloved of ladies, abandon all such hopes.  You impertinent boy.  I knew that was it, though I don't know everything. Agatha, I'm not young enough to know everything.  Young enough?  Don't you see? I'm not young enough to know

Yust short time ago Ay got dis yob cause Ay vas sick, need open air.  Sick? You? You'd never think it.  And, Anna, dis ain't real sailor yob. Dis ain't real boat on sea.

You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?

Ay love your mo'der too much for ever do dat, Anna.$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."

Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$Sure.  It's a great wonder you didn't forget it--and me without a chew.  Ouch! Darn you!  Shut your big mouth! What is the matter with you at all?  She pinched me--hard as she could, too--and look at her laughin'!  Cry-baby! I owed you one.  I'll fix you. I'll tell Eileen, wait 'n' see!  Tattle-tale! I don't care. Eileen's sick.  That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get even, you bet!  Shut up your noise! Go up to bed, the two of you, and no more talk, and you go with them, Mary.  Come on, Mary. Wake up.  Ow!  Hush your noise, you soft, weak thing, you! It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the time. I'll have a moment's peace, I will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!  Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?  No. The doctor's with her yet. Yes, go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
EN282	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold.  Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.  God rest his soul.  Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.  The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.  I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.  Thank you kindly, lady of the house.  Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.  I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.  Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?  There's no offence, lady of the house?  No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all?
EN283	1	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.   I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite, If any wonders you have seen this night?  I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light  Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.  Tell me, for thou art native of this place, What dost thou know about the King of Grace-- King of the Jews?   Aye, in Jerusalem He dwells, and not in Bethlehem. He sits upon his mighty judgment throne, Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.   I mean a new-born King, of love and peace; His is the star--His reign shall never cease.   All things tonight seem passing strange to me, I have just read an ancient prophecy That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town, Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown, Of one called Councillor of King David's line Whose coming is foretold in words divine. And now you come with words of mystery! Why should thy questions, which are dark to me, Cause me to think of Him?   The star! The star! No more it moves about the heavens afar, It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray, For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!   His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within And seek protection in my humble inn.    Three kings came riding from far away, Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar; Three wise men out of the east were they, And they traveled by night and they slept by day, For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.   The star was so beautiful, large and clear, That all other stars of the sky Became a white mist in the atmosphere; And by this they knew that the coming was near Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.
EN288	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Yes, that's the sort of politician for my money!  Then we'll consider it settled. Now, as the country is in a state of insurrection, it is absolutely necessary that you should assume the reins of Government at once; and, until it is ascertained which of you is to be king, I have arranged that you will reign jointly, so that no question can arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts.  As one individual?  As one individual.  Like this?  Something like that.  And we may take our friends with us, and give them places about the Court?  Undoubtedly. That's always done!  I'm convinced!  So am I!  Then the sooner we're off the better.  We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)--  Stop, stop--that won't do at all--ladies are not admitted.  What!  Not admitted. Not at present. Afterwards, perhaps. We'll see.  Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate us from our wives!  This is very awkward! Only for a time--a few months. Alter all, what is a few months?  But we've only been married half an hour!   Kind sir, you cannot have the heart Our lives to part From those to whom an hour ago We were united! Before our flowing hopes you stem, Ah, look at them, And pause before you deal this blow, All uninvited! You men can never understand That heart and hand Cannot be separated when We go a-yearning; You see, you've only women's eyes To idolize And only women's hearts, poor men, To set you burning! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!  Some kind of charm you seem to find In womankind-- Some source of unexplained delight (Unless you're jesting), But what attracts you, I confess, I cannot guess, To me a woman's face is quite Uninteresting! If from my sister I were torn, It could be borne-- I should, no doubt, be horrified, But I could bear it;-- But Marco's quite another thing-- He is my King, He has my heart and none beside Shall ever share it! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!

EN305	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$'Did you? I should have liked to see that. I have often oiled their bats for them. Careless lads, they always forget. Was that nice German boy with him?'  'Mr. Karl? Not far off, sir. He was sitting by the bank of the stream playing on his flute; and Miss Barbara, she had climbed one of my apple-trees,--she says they are your trees.'  'They are, you know, Dering,'  'Yes, sir, in a sense, but I don't like any of you to meddle with them. And there she sat, pelting the two of them with green apples.'  'How like her! I don't know how we are to make a demure young lady of her.'  'They say in the village, sir, that Master Will would like to try.'  'Ha! ha! he is just a colt himself. Who are all here now, Dering; in the house, I mean? I sometimes forget. They grow old so quickly. They go out at one door in the bloom of youth, and come back by another, tired and grey. Haven't you noticed it?'  'No, sir. The only visitors staying here are Miss Barbara and Mr. Karl. There's just them and yourselves, sir, you and the mistress and Master Will. That's all.'  'Yes, that's all,' his master says, still unconvinced. 'Who is the soldier, Dering?'  'Soldier, sir? There is no soldier here except yourself.'  'Isn't there? There was a nurse with him. Who is ill?'  'No one, sir. There's no nurse.' Dering backs away from the old man. Would you like me to call the mistress, sir?'  'No, she has gone down to the village. She told me why, but I forget. Miss Barbara is with her.'  'Miss Barbara is down by the stream, sir.'  'Is she? I think they said they were going to a wedding. Who is being married to-day, Dering?'  'I have heard of no wedding, sir. But here is Miss Barbara.'  'Here's the tomboy!'  'Dering, I believe you are complaining to the Colonel about my watering the flowers at the wrong time of day.''Aha! Aha!'  'I did just mention it, miss.'  'You horrid! Dear, don't mind him. And every time he says they are his flowers and his apples, you tell me, and I shall say to his face that they are yours.'  'The courage of those young things!'  'Let me make you comfy--the way granny does it.'  'That is not quite the way she does it, Do you call her granny, Barbara?'  'She asked me to--for practice. Don't you remember why?'  'I know! Billy boy.'  'You are quick today. Now, wait till I get your cane.'  'I don't need my cane while I'm sitting.'  'You look so beau'ful, sitting holding your cane. Oh dear! I am a clumsy.'  Not at all, but perhaps if I were to do it for myself. That's better. Thank you, Barbara, very much.'  'I didn't do it. I'm all thumbs. What a ghastly nurse I should make.'  'Nurse? Who is she, Barbara?'  'Who is who, dear?'  'That nurse.'  'There's no nurse here.'  'Isn't there?'  'Where is granny?'  'She has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'There's no wedding. Who could be being married?'  'I think it's people I know, but I can't remember who they are. I thought you went too, Barbara.'  'Not I. Catch me missing it if there had been a wedding!'  'You and the nurse.'  'Dear, you have just been imagining things again. Shall I play to you, or sing? Oh dear, everything catches in me. Would you like me to "Robin Adair," dear?'  'No, thank you, Barbara. Barbara, the house seems so empty. Where are Billy and Karl?'  'Billy is where Karl is, you may be sure.'  'And where is Karl?'  'He is where Billy boy is, you may be sure.'  'And where are they both?'  'Not far from where Barbara is, you bet. Do you hear Karl's flute? They have been down all the morning at the pool where the alder is, trying to catch that bull-trout.'  'They didn't get him, I'll swear!'  'You can ask them.'  'I spent a lot of my youth trying to get that bull-trout. I tumbled in there sixty years ago.'  'I tumbled in sixty minutes ago! It can't be the same trout, dear.'  'Same old rascal!'  'You muddy things!'  'Did you get the bull-trout, Billy boy?'  'He's a brute that.'  'He is, you know.'  BILLY. 'He came up several times and had a look at my fly. Didn't flick it, or do anything as complimentary as that. Just yawned and went down.'  COLONEL. 'Yawned, did he? Used to wink in my time. Did you and Billy fish at Heidelberg, Karl?'  KARL. 'We were more worthily employed, sir, but we did unbend at times. Billy, do you remember--' He begins a gay dance.

Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my nose. It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about the rain, and Darcy the devil choke him--and the towering church. Give me that whisky. Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all?  Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.  Is it that?  It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a bad wife in the house.  Is it herself, master of the house, and she a grand woman to talk?  It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still. Let you wait now a short while, and it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. Is that somebody above?  There's a voice speaking on the path.  Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying. Be falling to sleep now and don't let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life. I wouldn't have told you at all but it's destroyed with the drouth I was.  Have no fear, master of the house. What is it I know of the like of you that I'ld be saying a word or putting out my
EN307	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned. Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?  What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
EN306	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned.

Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's gone?  It is surely.  That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath.  He was a great man surely, stranger, and isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man, and he mad dying?  It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.  I heard tell this day, Nora Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself.  It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.  I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in a lonesome place you live itself.  It's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men, for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day, Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.  Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man?  What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?
EN300	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.   I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite, If any wonders you have seen this night?  I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light  Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.  Tell me, for thou art native of this place, What dost thou know about the King of Grace-- King of the Jews?   Aye, in Jerusalem He dwells, and not in Bethlehem. He sits upon his mighty judgment throne, Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.   I mean a new-born King, of love and peace; His is the star--His reign shall never cease.   All things tonight seem passing strange to me, I have just read an ancient prophecy That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town, Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown, Of one called Councillor of King David's line Whose coming is foretold in words divine. And now you come with words of mystery! Why should thy questions, which are dark to me, Cause me to think of Him?   The star! The star! No more it moves about the heavens afar, It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray, For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!   His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within And seek protection in my humble inn.    Three kings came riding from far away, Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar; Three wise men out of the east were they, And they traveled by night and they slept by day, For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.   The star was so beautiful, large and clear, That all other stars of the sky Became a white mist in the atmosphere; And by this they knew that the coming was near Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.
EN303	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$A bloody-handed murderer the like of...  Whisht I am saying; we'll take no fooling from your like at all.And you, young fellow, you'd have a right to stop, I'm thinking, for we'd do our all and utmost to content your needs.  And I'd be safe in this place from the searching law?  You would, surely. If they're not fearing you, itself, the peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows, wouldn't touch a cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night.  Let you stop a short while anyhow. Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.  It's a nice room, and if it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.  Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door, and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk at the wake.  And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?  Christopher Mahon.  Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.  God bless you all.  God bless you.  Are you wanting me to stop along with you and keep you from harm?  Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?  There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it too.  You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step off nimble this time when there's none.  Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...  Go on, then, to Father Reilly, and let him put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.  If I meet the Widow Quin...  Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your noise. That lad would wear the spirits from the saints of peace. timidly. Then she comes to him and speaks with bland good-humour.) Let you stretch out now by the fire, young fellow. You should be destroyed travelling.

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself?

Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not.

Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.

The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--
EN309	1	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?  Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big, tall little girl.  A great, big tall little girl, hey?  And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.  Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?  And so do I.  And so do you, hey?  Yes, sir; that is our wish.  Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.  You said you could give us anything we wished for.  But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine. Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll see what I can do for you.
EN308	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee Peter Pan.  I am that. Here's the little, fat body. And here's the four legs. I'll just stick the legs on with nails--and there he stands. Now, here's a little potato for a head, and an ould skinny carrot for a trunk. I'll stick them on with a hair pin. Now, I'll stick on the ears and put in the shoe-button eyes, and with this wee bit of black paper for a tailpiece, and there ye are. Mr. Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan as natural as life and twice as handsome.  Here's a doll baby I've dressed, but it's no head she has at all, at all.  Use a big yellow apple or a wee yellow punkin, and put on a baby cap--and there ye are. Stick in some buttons for eyes, and a wee nose and mouth of red paper--and stick the head on the body with some hair pins, and the quane herself niver had a better doll baby.  I'll put her right here on the table alongside of the iliphant.  It's nine o'clock, it is. Isn't it time for the children to be home?  It is that. And here they come now.  The Mulligans are coming now, as happy as can be, We've been to the Sunday School and saw the Christmas tree, Had a lark with Santa Claus and take a tip from me, We'll all be marching on Christmas!  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here, Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year, And we'll be marching on Christmas!  Patsy got a trumpet, little Micky got a drum, Matsy got a spinning top, you ought to hear it hum, Clarissa got a candy cane, oh, won't we have the fun, When we are marching on Christmas!

Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?
EN008	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road, and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.  Providence and Mercy, spare us all!  It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.  I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?  The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.  Well, you should have been a queer lot. I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more years of age.  Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a Tuesday and halve his skull.  Well, you'll have peace in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.  It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in me and bravery of...  Oh, glory! it's late for knocking, and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.

The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself?

Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not.

A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$How is his lordship now?  A little easier, sir.  Crichton, send Fisher to me.  I have no pity for you girls, I--  Ernest, go away, and don't insult the broken-hearted.  And uncommon glad I am to go. Ta-ta, all of you. He asked me to say a few words. I came here to say a few words, and I'm not at all sure that I couldn't bring an action against him.  My poor sisters, come here. We must make this draw us closer together. I shall do my best to help you in every way. Just now I cannot think of myself at all.  But how unlike you, Mary.  It is my duty to protect my sisters.  I never knew her so sweet before, Agatha. (Cautiously.) What do you propose to do, Mary?  I propose when we are on the yacht to lend Fisher to you when I don't need her myself.  Fisher?  Of course, as the eldest, I have decided that it is my maid we shall take with us.  Mary, you toad.  Nothing on earth would induce Fisher to lift her hand for either me or Catherine.  I was afraid of it, Agatha. That is why I am so sorry for you.  Fisher, you heard what his lordship said?  Yes, my lady.  You have given me some satisfaction of late, Fisher, and to mark my approval I have decided that you shall be the maid who accompanies us.  I thank you, my lady.  That is all; you may go.  If you please, my lady, I wish to give notice.  Oh, certainly--you may go.  But why, Fisher?  I could not undertake, my lady, to wait upon three. We don't do it. Oh, my lady, to think that this affront--  I thought I told you to go, Fisher.  Serves you right.  It will be Simmons after all. Send Simmons to me.  My lady, might I venture to speak?  What is it?  I happen to know, your ladyship, that Simmons desires to give notice for the same reason as Fisher.  Oh!  Then, Catherine, we take Jeanne.  And Jeanne also, my lady.  We can't blame them. Could any maid who respected herself be got to wait upon three?  I suppose there are such persons, Crichton?  I have heard, my lady, that there are such.  Crichton, what's to be done? We sail in two days; could one be discovered in the time?  Surely you can think of some one?  There is in this establishment, your ladyship, a young woman--  Yes?  A young woman, on whom I have for some time cast an eye.  Do you mean as a possible lady's-maid?  I had thought of her, my lady, in another connection.  Ah!  But I believe she is quite the young person you require. Perhaps if you could see her, my lady--  I shall certainly see her. Bring her to me. You two needn't wait.  Needn't we? We see your little game, Mary.  We shall certainly remain and have our two-thirds of her.  This, my lady, is the young person.  Oh dear!  Come here, girl. Don't be afraid.  Her appearance, my lady, is homely, and her manners, as you may have observed, deplorable, but she has a heart of gold.  What is your position downstairs?  I'm a tweeny, your ladyship.  A what?  A tweeny; that is to say, my lady, she is not at present, strictly speaking, anything; a between maid; she helps the vegetable maid. It is she, my lady, who conveys the dishes from the one end of the kitchen table, where they are placed by the cook, to the other end, where they enter into the charge of Thomas and John.  I see. And you and Crichton are--ah--keeping company?  A butler don't keep company, my lady.  Does he not?  No, your ladyship, we butlers may--(he makes a gesture with his arms)--but we do not keep company.  I know what it is; you are engaged?

Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?  Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big, tall little girl.  A great, big tall little girl, hey?  And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.  Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?  And so do I.  And so do you, hey?  Yes, sir; that is our wish.  Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.  You said you could give us anything we wished for.  But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine. Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll see what I can do for you.
EN007	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.  Is it dead he is or living?  It's little you care if it's dead or living I am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead. Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half in your skin.
EN004	0	Then you think the sea's to blame for everything, eh? Well, you're still workin' on it, ain't you, spite of all you used to write me about hating it. That dame was here told me you was captain of a coal barge--and you wrote me you was yanitor of a building!  Oh, Ay work on land long time as yanitor. Yust short time ago Ay got dis yob cause Ay vas sick, need open air.  Sick? You? You'd never think it.  And, Anna, dis ain't real sailor yob. Dis ain't real boat on sea. She's yust ole tub--like piece of land with house on it dat float. Yob on her ain't sea yob. No. Ay don't gat yob on sea, Anna, if Ay die first. Ay swear dat, ven your mo'der die. Ay keep my word, py yingo!  Well, I can't see no difference. Speaking of being sick, I been there myself--yust out of the hospital two weeks ago.  You, Anna? Py golly! You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?  Anna, Ay like see you like hell, Ay tal you! And don't you talk no more about gatting yob. You stay with me. Ay don't see you for long time, you don't forgat dat. Ay'm gatting ole. Ay gat no one in vorld but you.  Thanks. It sounds good to hear someone--talk to me that way. Say, though--if you're so lonely--it's funny--why ain't you ever married again?  Ay love your mo'der too much for ever do dat, Anna.$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN005	1	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee Peter Pan.  I am that. Here's the little, fat body. And here's the four legs. I'll just stick the legs on with nails--and there he stands. Now, here's a little potato for a head, and an ould skinny carrot for a trunk. I'll stick them on with a hair pin. Now, I'll stick on the ears and put in the shoe-button eyes, and with this wee bit of black paper for a tailpiece, and there ye are. Mr. Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan as natural as life and twice as handsome.  Here's a doll baby I've dressed, but it's no head she has at all, at all.  Use a big yellow apple or a wee yellow punkin, and put on a baby cap--and there ye are. Stick in some buttons for eyes, and a wee nose and mouth of red paper--and stick the head on the body with some hair pins, and the quane herself niver had a better doll baby.  I'll put her right here on the table alongside of the iliphant.  It's nine o'clock, it is. Isn't it time for the children to be home?  It is that. And here they come now.  The Mulligans are coming now, as happy as can be, We've been to the Sunday School and saw the Christmas tree, Had a lark with Santa Claus and take a tip from me, We'll all be marching on Christmas!  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here, Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year, And we'll be marching on Christmas!  Patsy got a trumpet, little Micky got a drum, Matsy got a spinning top, you ought to hear it hum, Clarissa got a candy cane, oh, won't we have the fun, When we are marching on Christmas!  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here,

I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain
EN003	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$But, bless my heart, consider my position! I am the wife of one, that's very clear; But who can tell, except by intuition, Which is the Prince, and which the Gondolier?  Submit to Fate without unseemly wrangle: Such complications frequently occur-- Life is one closely complicated tangle: Death is the only true unraveller!  Try we life-long, we can never Straighten out life's tangled skein, Why should we, in vain endeavour, Guess and guess and guess again?  Life's a pudding full of plums,  Care's a canker that benumbs.  Life's a pudding full of plums, Care's a canker that benumbs. Wherefore waste our elocution On impossible solution? Life's a pleasant institution, Let us take it as it comes!  Set aside the dull enigma, We shall guess it all too soon; Failure brings no kind of stigma-- Dance we to another tune!  String the lyre and fill the cup, Lest on sorrow we should sup.  Hop and skip to Fancy's fiddle, Hands across and down the middle-- Life's perhaps the only riddle That we shrink from giving up!    Bridegroom and bride! Knot that's insoluble, Voices all voluble Hail it with pride. Bridegroom and bride! We in sincerity Wish you prosperity, Bridegroom and bride! When a merry maiden marries, Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries; Every sound becomes a song, All is right, and nothing's wrong! From to-day and ever after Let our tears be tears of laughter. Every sigh that finds a vent Be a sigh of sweet content! When you marry, merry maiden, Then the air with love is laden; Every flower is a rose, Every goose becomes a swan, Every kind of trouble goes Where the last year's snows have gone! Sunlight takes the place of shade When you marry, merry maid!  When a merry maiden marries, Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries; Every sound becomes a song, All is right, and nothing's wrong. Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow, Get ye gone until to-morrow; Jealousies in grim array, Ye are things of yesterday! When you marry, merry maiden, Then the air with joy is laden; All the corners of the earth Ring with music sweetly played, Worry is melodious mirth, Grief is joy in masquerade;
EN001	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN482	0	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$'Yes, perhaps.'  'Good-night, Robert.'  'Good-night, dear.'  'Dick!'  'I have come to sit with you for a bit, father.'  'It's you, Dick; it's you!'  'It's me all right, father. I say, don't be startled, or anything of that kind. We don't like that.'  'My boy!'  'How am I looking, father?'  'You haven't altered, Dick.'  'Rather not. It's jolly to see the old studio again! I say, father, don't fuss. Let us be our ordinary selves, won't you?'  'I'll try, I'll try. You didn't say you had come to sit with me, Dick? Not with me!'  'Rather!'  'But your mother----'  'It's you I want.'  'Me?'  'We can only come to one, you see.'  'Then why me?'  'That's the reason. Hello, here's your old jacket, greasier than ever!'  'Me? But, Dick, it is as if you had forgotten. It was your mother who was everything to you. It can't be you if you have forgotten that. I used to feel so out of it; but, of course, you didn't know.'  'I didn't know it till lately, father; but heaps of things that I didn't know once are clear to me now. I didn't know that you were the one who would miss me most; but I know now.'  'Me miss you most? Dick, I try to paint just as before. I go to the club. Dick, I have been to a dinner-party. I said I wouldn't give in.'  'We like that.'  'But, my boy----'  'I say, father, let's get away from that sort of thing.'  'That is so like you, Dick! I'll do anything you ask.'  'Then keep a bright face.'  'I've tried to.'  'Good man! I say, put on your old greasy; you are looking so beastly clean.'  'Anything you like. No, that's the wrong sleeve. Thanks, Dick.'  'Here, let me shove you into your old seat.'  'How's that, umpire!'  'Dick, that's just how you used to butt me into it long ago!'  'When I was a kid.'  'With the palette in my hand.'  'Or sticking to your trousers.'  'The mess we made of ourselves, Dick.' 'I sneaked behind the settle and climbed up it.'  'Till you fell off.'  'On top of you and the palette.'  'Ah, Dick.'  'Now then, behave! What did I say about that face?'  'That's better. I'll sit here.'  'Got your pipe?'  'I don't--I don't seem to care to smoke nowadays, Dick.'  'Rot! Just because I am dead! You that pretend to be plucky! I won't have it, you know. You get your pipe, and look slippy about it.'  'Yes, Dick, Now, then, burn your thumb with the match--you always did, you know. That's the style. You've forgotten to cock your head to the side. Not so bad. That's you. Like it?'  'It's rather nice, Dick. Dick, you and me by the fire!'  'Yes, but sit still. How often we might have been like this, father, and weren't.'  'Ah!'  'Face. How is Fido?'  'Never a dog missed her master more.'  'Oh, She doesn't want to go and sit on my grave, or any of that tosh, does she? As if I were there!'  'No, no, she goes ratting, Dick.'  'Good old Fido!'  'Dick, here's a good one. We oughtn't to keep a dog at all because we are on rations now; but what do you think Fido ate yesterday?'

I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain
EN480	0	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$'Not I.'  'Young gentlemen, how disgraceful!'  'Harum-scarums!'  'Does he know about you two?'  'He often forgets, I'll tell him again. Grandfather, Barbara and I have something to say to you. It's this.'  'I know--I know. There's nothing like it. I'm very glad, Barbara.'  'You see, dear, I've loved Billy boy since the days when he tried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I held on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at school at marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroom had always to take the name of Billy. "Do you, woman, take this man Billy--" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answer diffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, "I should rather think she does."'  'Don't forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldn't find the ring!'  'Were you married here, sir?'  'Yes, at the village church.'  'So were my father and mother.'  'I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some of the furniture.'  'I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?'  'No, just the same.'  'I hoped you would say that.'  'But, Billy, I'm to have such a dream of a wedding gown. Granny is going with me to London, to choose it'--laying her head on the Colonel's shoulder--'if you can do without her for a day, dear.'  'I shall go with you, I couldn't trust you and granny to choose the gown.'  'You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out and about enjoying ourselves.'  'They all say that. But that is the time when I'm not lonely, Karl. It's then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It all comes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and it's so real, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to see them; I don't know they haven't been here, Billy, till your granny tells me afterwards.' 'Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.'  'It isn't often she leaves you for so long, dear.'  'She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes, she has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'A wedding?'  'It's curious how he harps on that.'  'She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.'  'Not to-day, dear.'  'Best not to worry him.'  'But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.'  'Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?'  'You were there, Barbara.'  'No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.'  'She was there, too.'  'Any one else?'  'There was that soldier.'  'A soldier also!'  'Just those three.'  'But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.'  'They were all there; but there were only three.'  'Odd.'  'Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right. She is the one for you.'  'She is the one for me.'  'If there had been a wedding, wouldn't she have taken the Colonel with her?'  'Of course she would.'  'You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.'  'Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, very likely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on their wedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are all pretty on their wedding day.' 'You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!'  'Yes, I have; yes, I have!'  'I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to you about Billy boy and me, and you haven't been able to wait; you have hurried on the wedding!'  'Bravo, Barbara, you've got it.'  'That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.'  'Our wedding, Billy!'  'It doesn't explain those other people, though.'  'What is it, dear?'  'I can't quite remember, but I think that is why she didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy is to be there, my love.'  'Not at my wedding!'  'Grandfather!'  'There's something sad about it.'  'There can't be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Granny didn't say it was a sad wedding, did she?'  'She was smiling.'  'Of course she was.'  'But I think that was only to please the nurse.'  'That nurse again! Dear, don't think any more about it. There's no wedding.'  'Is there not?'  'I told you! There is a wedding!'  'It's Barbara's wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbara's wedding?'
EN481	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$'Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things to do: and you, too, Barbara. They are leaving in an hour, John.'  'If you would like to take Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the garden.'  'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'  'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'  'But there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'  'Let me, dear,'  'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'  'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is. There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew, he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go to the alder pool, Barbara.'  'We won't go there, dear.'  'Did I do all right, Ellen?'  'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'  'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion! I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'  'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to you; you like that, don't you?'  'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No, I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'  'Barbara?'  'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'  'Which bit shall I read?'  'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.' 'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun to laugh already.'  'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'  'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish? Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'  'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'  'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'  'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but something prevents him.'  'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'  'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better. Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'  'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little light?'  'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it helps one to concentrate.'   'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you still there?'  'I think I felt a movement.'  'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'  'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'  'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'  'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'  'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'  'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with A?--with B? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the fourth word Welcome? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me Welcome.'

Anybody feel funny dat vay in fog.  But why d'you s'pose I feel so--so--like I'd found something I'd missed and been looking for--'s if this was the right place for me to fit in? And I seem to have forgot--everything that's happened--like it didn't matter no more. And I feel clean, somehow--like you feel yust after you've took a bath. And I feel happy for once--yes, honest!--happier than I ever been anywhere before! It's nutty for me to feel that way, don't you think?  Ay tank Ay'm damn fool for bring you on voyage, Anna.

You need it, I guess.$$$Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with me.  And where is he now?  Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.  Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay for Mrs. O'Toole.  I can't drink any tay. I'm that injured I can't drink at all, at all.  A drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.  Yis, mum.  I was out in me cabbage garden picking a bit of cabbage for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water. And I'm almost killed entirely--and it's all the fault of your goat, Mrs. Mulligan.  There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things easy.  I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan.

Sure, it's more than me feelings that is wounded, Mrs. Mulligan.  Maw, ain't it time we were starting for the entertainment?

Sure, your family looks as though they were going out in society, Mollie Mulligan.  hey are that. They're on their way to the fine church entertainment at the Sunday School down the strate.  Maw, here comes Matsy with the goat.  Matsy Mulligan, tie that goat in the back yard and tie all his four fate together. I'll tach him a lesson, if it's the last thing I ever do. Patsy, go out and help your brother tie up Shamus O'Brien.
EN487	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$I did not then. I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of it on the ridge of his skull, and he went down at my feet like an empty sack, and never let a grunt or groan from him at all.  And what way weren't you hanged, mister? Did you bury him then?  Aye. I buried him then. Wasn't I digging spuds in the field?  And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that you're out?  Never a one of them, and I walking forward facing hog, dog, or divil on the highway of the road.  It's only with a common week-day kind of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase, and that man should be a great terror when his temper's roused.  He should then. And where was it, mister honey, that you did the deed?  Oh, a distant place, master of the house, a windy corner of high, distant hills.  He's a close man, and he's right, surely.  That'd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a pot-boy, Michael James, if it's the truth you're seeking one at all.  The peelers is fearing him, and if you'd that lad in the house there isn't one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard.  Bravery's a treasure in a lonesome place, and a lad would kill his father, I'm thinking, would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on the flags of hell.  It's the truth they're saying, and if I'd that lad in the house, I wouldn't be fearing the loosed kharki cut-throats, or the walking dead.  Well, glory be to God!  Would you think well to stop here and be pot-boy, mister honey, if we gave you good wages, and didn't destroy you with the weight of work?  That'd be a queer kind to bring into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike.  Will you whisht? Who's speaking to you?

It's not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke, and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good.  What was it you got?  Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.  Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....  Son of God deliver us.  Now you'll not marry her the time I'm rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.

That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.
EN488	0	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a sheep.  It's true the Lord God formed you to contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?  Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?  Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her pigsty and not plague us here.  I'm going; but he'll come with me.  Are you dumb, young fellow?  God increase you; but I'm pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.  Now you have heard him, and go on from this.  It's lonesome this hour crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.  Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will send you now.  Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.

EN489	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.
EN500	0	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$Humph! He's original in that opinion.  I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.
EN138	0	Then you think the sea's to blame for everything, eh? Well, you're still workin' on it, ain't you, spite of all you used to write me about hating it.

Yust short time ago Ay got dis yob cause Ay vas sick, need open air.  Sick? You? You'd never think it.  And, Anna, dis ain't real sailor yob. Dis ain't real boat on sea.

You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?  Anna, Ay like see you like hell, Ay tal you! And don't you talk no more about gatting yob. You stay with me. Ay don't see you for long time, you don't forgat dat. Ay'm gatting ole.

Ay love your mo'der too much for ever do dat, Anna.$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned. Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?  What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
EN139	1	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!

The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.

I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now.

It's above at the cross-roads he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him to Kate Cassidy's wake.  And he's going that length in the dark night?

This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$That's five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It's not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke, and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good.  What was it you got?  Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.  Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....  Son of God deliver us.  Now you'll not marry her the time I'm rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.
EN131	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$There's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them, and he not reckoning them at all.  Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's gone?  It is surely.  That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath.  He was a great man surely, stranger, and isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man, and he mad dying?  It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.  I heard tell this day, Nora Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself.  It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.  I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in a lonesome place you live itself.  It's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men, for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day, Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.  Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man?  What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?
EN136	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Then I run, and I run, and I run, till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain
EN137	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'

I don't care. Eileen's sick.  That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get even, you bet!  Shut up your noise!

It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the time. I'll have a moment's peace, I will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!  Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?  No. The doctor's with her yet. Yes, go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
EN135	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road, and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.  Providence and Mercy, spare us all!  It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.  I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?  The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.  Well, you should have been a queer lot. I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more years of age.  Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a Tuesday and halve his skull.  Well, you'll have peace in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.  It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in me and bravery of...  Oh, glory! it's late for knocking, and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.
EN437	0	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$Do not give way to this uncalled-for grief, Your separation will be very brief. To ascertain which is the King And which the other, To Barataria's Court I'll bring His foster-mother; Her former nurseling to declare She'll be delighted. That settled, let each happy pair Be reunited. Viva! His argument is strong! Viva! We'll not be parted long! Viva! It will be settled soon! Viva! Then comes our honeymoon!    Then one of us will be a Queen, And sit on a golden throne, With a crown instead Of a hat on her head, And diamonds all her own! With a beautiful robe of gold and green, I've always understood; I wonder whether She'd wear a feather? I rather think she should!  Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, To be a regular Royal Queen! No half-and-half affair, I mean, But a right-down regular Royal Queen!  She'll drive about in a carriage and pair, With the King on her left-hand side, And a milk-white horse, As a matter of course, Whenever she wants to ride! With beautiful silver shoes to wear Upon her dainty feet; With endless stocks Of beautiful frocks And as much as she wants to eat!  Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.  Whenever she condescends to walk, Be sure she'll shine at that, With her haughty stare And her nose in the air, Like a well-born aristocrat! At elegant high society talk She'll bear away the bell, With her "How de do?" And her "How are you?" And "I trust I see you well!"  ALL. Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.  GIU. And noble lords will scrape and bow, And double themselves in two, And open their eyes In blank surprise At whatever she likes to do. And everybody will roundly vow She's fair as flowers in May,
EN436	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$Then I run, and I run, and I run, till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain
EN435	1	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$Humph! He's original in that opinion.  I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.
EN434	0	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$Yes, that's the sort of politician for my money!  Then we'll consider it settled. Now, as the country is in a state of insurrection, it is absolutely necessary that you should assume the reins of Government at once; and, until it is ascertained which of you is to be king, I have arranged that you will reign jointly, so that no question can arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts.  As one individual?  As one individual.  Like this?  Something like that.  And we may take our friends with us, and give them places about the Court?  Undoubtedly. That's always done!  I'm convinced!  So am I!  Then the sooner we're off the better.  We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)--  Stop, stop--that won't do at all--ladies are not admitted.  What!  Not admitted. Not at present. Afterwards, perhaps. We'll see.  Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate us from our wives!  This is very awkward! Only for a time--a few months. Alter all, what is a few months?  But we've only been married half an hour!   Kind sir, you cannot have the heart Our lives to part From those to whom an hour ago We were united! Before our flowing hopes you stem, Ah, look at them, And pause before you deal this blow, All uninvited! You men can never understand That heart and hand Cannot be separated when We go a-yearning; You see, you've only women's eyes To idolize And only women's hearts, poor men, To set you burning! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!  Some kind of charm you seem to find In womankind-- Some source of unexplained delight (Unless you're jesting), But what attracts you, I confess, I cannot guess, To me a woman's face is quite Uninteresting! If from my sister I were torn, It could be borne-- I should, no doubt, be horrified, But I could bear it;-- But Marco's quite another thing-- He is my King, He has my heart and none beside Shall ever share it! Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!
EN433	0	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$I never killed my father. I'd be afeard to do that, except I was the like of yourself with blind rages tearing me within, for I'm thinking you should have had great tussling when the end was come.  We had not then. It was a hard woman was come over the hill, and if he was always a crusty kind when he'd a hard woman setting him on, not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up with him at all.  And isn't it a great wonder that one wasn't fearing you?  Up to the day I killed my father, there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no man giving me heed.  It was the girls were giving you heed maybe, and I'm thinking it's most conceit you'd have to be gaming with their like.  Not the girls itself, and I won't tell you a lie. There wasn't anyone heeding me in that place saving only the dumb beasts of the field.  And I thinking you should have been living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world.  The like of a king, is it? And I after toiling, moiling, digging, dodging from the dawn till dusk with never a sight of joy or sport saving only when I'd be abroad in the dark night poaching rabbits on hills, for I was a devil to poach, God forgive me, and I near got six months for going with a dung fork and stabbing a fish.  And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?  I did, God help me, and there I'd be as happy as the sunshine of St. Martin's Day, watching the light passing the north or the patches of fog, till I'd hear a rabbit starting to screech and I'd go running in the furze.
EN432	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$I never killed my father. I'd be afeard to do that, except I was the like of yourself with blind rages tearing me within, for I'm thinking you should have had great tussling when the end was come.  We had not then. It was a hard woman was come over the hill, and if he was always a crusty kind when he'd a hard woman setting him on, not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up with him at all.  And isn't it a great wonder that one wasn't fearing you?  Up to the day I killed my father, there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no man giving me heed.  It was the girls were giving you heed maybe, and I'm thinking it's most conceit you'd have to be gaming with their like.  Not the girls itself, and I won't tell you a lie. There wasn't anyone heeding me in that place saving only the dumb beasts of the field.  And I thinking you should have been living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world.  The like of a king, is it? And I after toiling, moiling, digging, dodging from the dawn till dusk with never a sight of joy or sport saving only when I'd be abroad in the dark night poaching rabbits on hills, for I was a devil to poach, God forgive me, and I near got six months for going with a dung fork and stabbing a fish.  And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?  I did, God help me, and there I'd be as happy as the sunshine of St. Martin's Day, watching the light passing the north or the patches of fog, till I'd hear a rabbit starting to screech and I'd go running in the furze.
EN431	0	Gawd, I can't stand this! I better beat it.  Well, who's the blond?  Dat vas Anna, Larry.  Your daughter, Anna?  Don't you tank she vas pooty gel, Larry?  Sure! A peach!  You bet you! Give me drink for take back--one port vine for Anna--she calabrate dis one time with me--and small beer for me.  Small beer for you, eh? She's reformin' you already.  You bet! You look tired, Anna. Veil, Ay make you take good long rest now. Come, you drink vine. It put new life in you. Skoal, Anna! You know dat Svedish word?  Skoal! Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!       Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."
EN430	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$'I'll try not to,'  'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong about me.'  'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN439	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.  Is it dead he is or living?  It's little you care if it's dead or living I am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead. Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half in your skin.
EN438	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$'I wonder where I put my glasses?'  'I'll look for them.'  'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes?'  'I suppose you couldn't help it.'  'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'  'Did _you_, Roger?'  'Of course. Didn't you, father?'  'No! I knew the old lady better.'  'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven. To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.  'I don't remember him, mater.'  'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you. I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen. That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever, Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers. I'll get my glasses.'  'Like to change your mother, Roger?'  'What do you think?'  'Not going, Roger?'  'Yes, I thought--'  'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'  'A what? You and me!'  'Why not?'  'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.  'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'  'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'  'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'  'I suppose so.'  'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'  'I didn't. Good-night, father.'  'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have a chat with you?'  'I thought we had had it.'  'No such luck.'  'I like your uniform, Roger,'  'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'  'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell you that I'm proud of you?'  'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'  'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till you were twenty?'  'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'  'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'  'Me?'  'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'  'Often.'  'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'  'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'  'So is mine,'  'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are thinking, Roger.'  'Do you? Same here.'  'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'  'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'  'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath, "Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'  'No.'  'Who?'  'You.'  'Just how I feel.'  'It's pretty ghastly, father.'  'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'  'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'  'You soon shut me up.'  'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'  'They say the same about you.'  'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person?'  'How did you know that?'  'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'  'Are you?'

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not.

There they are now at the door.  The gods save you.  getting up and courtesy-ing. -- The gods save and keep you kindly, and stand between you and all harm for ever.  Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.

The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$I never killed my father. I'd be afeard to do that, except I was the like of yourself with blind rages tearing me within, for I'm thinking you should have had great tussling when the end was come.  We had not then. It was a hard woman was come over the hill, and if he was always a crusty kind when he'd a hard woman setting him on, not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up with him at all.  And isn't it a great wonder that one wasn't fearing you?  Up to the day I killed my father, there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no man giving me heed.  It was the girls were giving you heed maybe, and I'm thinking it's most conceit you'd have to be gaming with their like.  Not the girls itself, and I won't tell you a lie. There wasn't anyone heeding me in that place saving only the dumb beasts of the field.  And I thinking you should have been living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world.  The like of a king, is it? And I after toiling, moiling, digging, dodging from the dawn till dusk with never a sight of joy or sport saving only when I'd be abroad in the dark night poaching rabbits on hills, for I was a devil to poach, God forgive me, and I near got six months for going with a dung fork and stabbing a fish.  And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?  I did, God help me, and there I'd be as happy as the sunshine of St. Martin's Day, watching the light passing the north or the patches of fog, till I'd hear a rabbit starting to screech and I'd go running in the furze.
EN227	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.
EN224	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother. I was just like her when I was that age.  And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.  Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I think the show is about to begin. Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical! Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical! Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks! Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks! Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled, Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld, The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man, Aerial Artists from far-off Japan, Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun, Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!  Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old, to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcel post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife.
EN225	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Six yards of stuff for to make a yellow gown. A pair of lace boots with lengthy heels on them and brassy eyes. A hat is suited for a wedding-day. A fine tooth comb. To be sent with three barrels of porter in Jimmy Farrell's creel cart on the evening of the coming Fair to Mister Michael James Flaherty. With the best compliments of this season. Margaret Flaherty.  Where's himself?  He's coming. To Mister Sheamus Mulroy, Wine and Spirit Dealer, Castlebar.  I didn't see him on the road.  How would you see him and is dark night this half hour gone by?  I stood a while outside wondering would I have a right to pass on or to walk in and see you,  and I could hear the cows breathing, and sighing in the stillness of the air, and not a step moving any place from this gate to the bridge.  It's above at the cross-roads he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him to Kate Cassidy's wake.  And he's going that length in the dark night?  He is surely, and leaving me lonesome on the scruff of the hill. Isn't it long the nights are now, Shawn Keogh, to be leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of day?  If it is, when we're wedded in a short while you'll have no call to complain, for I've little will to be walking off to wakes or weddings in the darkness of the night.  You're making mighty certain, Shaneen, that I'll wed you now.  Aren't we after making a good bargain, the way we're only waiting these days on Father Reilly's dispensation from the bishops, or the Court of Rome.

Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.

Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$Of the child that is born, O Baltasar, I begged a woman to tell us the news; I said in the east we had seen His star, And had ridden fast and had ridden far To find and worship the King of the Jews.  Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star Is standing still over this lowly hut.  Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!  What ho, within!  Sirs, whom seek ye?   We have journeyed from afar Led by the shining of yon splendid star. We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.   We seek a new-born King, Gold, frankincense to him we bring. And many a kingly offering.  Behold, the child is clothed in light!   Our journey ends, passed is the night.   Now let us make no more delay, But worship Him right worthily.   Hail, hail, dear child Of a maiden meek and mild. See, he merries! See, he smiles, my sweeting, I give thee greeting! Have a bob of cherries.   Hail, little One we've sought, See, a bird I've brought, See its feathers gay. Hail, little One adored, Hail, blessed King and Lord, Star of the day!   Hail, little One, so dear, My heart is full of cheer, A little ball I bring, Reach forth thy fingers gay, And take the ball and play, My blessed King. I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings, And here a scepter full of gems, For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!   And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    The greatest gift is yet ungiven, The gift that cometh straight from Heaven. O, Heavenly King, Heart's love we bring.   Not gold nor gems from land or sea Is worth the love we offer Thee.   And lowly folk who have no gold, Nor gift to offer that is meet, May bring the dearest thing of all-- A loving heart and service sweet.
EN341	0	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$If we did, my lady, the first thing we should do would be to elect a head. Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?
EN340	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me.

There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$In the regrettable slang of the servants' hall, my lady, the master is usually referred to as the Gov.  I see. You--  Yes, I understand that is what they call me.  You didn't even take your meals with the family?  No, my lady, I dined apart.  You, girl, also? Did you dine with Crichton?  No, your ladyship.  With whom?  I took my bit of supper with--with Daddy and Polly and the rest.  Dear old Daddy--he was our monkey. You remember our monkey, Agatha?  Rather! What a funny old darling he was.  And don't you think Polly was the sweetest little parrot, Mary?  Ah! I understand; animals you had domesticated?  Quite so--quite so.  The servants' teas that used to take place here once a month--  They did not seem natural on the island, my lady, and were discontinued by the Gov.'s orders.  A clear proof, Loam, that they were a mistake here.  I admit it frankly. I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I think of going over to the Tories.  I am delighted to hear it.  Thank you, Crichton, thank you; that is all.  One moment. Young people, Crichton, will be young people, even on an island; now, I suppose there was a certain amount of--shall we say sentimentalising, going on? Yes, my lady, there was.  Mother!  Which gentleman? You, girl, tell me.  If you please, my lady--  The fact is--  It was him--Mr. Ernest, your ladyship.  With which lady?  I have already told you, Lady Brocklehurst, that Ernest and I--  Yes, now; but you were two years on the island. Was it this lady?  No, your ladyship.  Then I don't care which of the others it was. Well, I suppose that will do.  Do! I hope you are ashamed of yourself, mother. You are an excellent fellow, Crichton; and if, after we are married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.  Oh no, impossible--  Why impossible? Do you see why it should be impossible, my man?  Yes, my lady. I had not told you, my lord, but as soon as your lordship is suited I wish to leave service.  What will you do, Crichton?  Shall I withdraw, my lord?  Horrid of me, wasn't it? But if one wasn't disagreeable now and again, it would be horribly tedious to be an old woman. He will soon be yours, Mary, and then--think of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to me. On that understanding, my dear, don't you think we might--?  Quite so--quite so. To wish you every dear happiness.  The same to you, my lady.  Do you despise me, Crichton? You are the best man among us.  On an island, my lady, perhaps; but in England, no.  Then there's something wrong with England.  My lady, not even from you can I listen to a word against England.  Tell me one thing: you have not lost your courage?  No, my lady.
EN343	0	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$There's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them, and he not reckoning them at all.  Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's gone?  It is surely.  That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath.  He was a great man surely, stranger, and isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man, and he mad dying?  It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.  I heard tell this day, Nora Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself.  It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.  I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in a lonesome place you live itself.  It's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men, for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day, Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.  Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man?  What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?
EN342	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned. Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?  What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
EN345	1	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN344	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN228	0	Gawd, I can't stand this! I better beat it.  Well, who's the blond?  Dat vas Anna, Larry.  Your daughter, Anna?  Don't you tank she vas pooty gel, Larry?  Sure! A peach!  You bet you! Give me drink for take back--one port vine for Anna--she calabrate dis one time with me--and small beer for me.  Small beer for you, eh? She's reformin' you already.  You bet! You look tired, Anna. Veil, Ay make you take good long rest now. Come, you drink vine. It put new life in you. Skoal, Anna! You know dat Svedish word?  Skoal! Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!       Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$If we did, my lady, the first thing we should do would be to elect a head. Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?
EN229	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Six yards of stuff for to make a yellow gown. A pair of lace boots with lengthy heels on them and brassy eyes. A hat is suited for a wedding-day. A fine tooth comb. To be sent with three barrels of porter in Jimmy Farrell's creel cart on the evening of the coming Fair to Mister Michael James Flaherty. With the best compliments of this season. Margaret Flaherty.  Where's himself?  He's coming. To Mister Sheamus Mulroy, Wine and Spirit Dealer, Castlebar.  I didn't see him on the road.  How would you see him and is dark night this half hour gone by?  I stood a while outside wondering would I have a right to pass on or to walk in and see you,  and I could hear the cows breathing, and sighing in the stillness of the air, and not a step moving any place from this gate to the bridge.  It's above at the cross-roads he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him to Kate Cassidy's wake.  And he's going that length in the dark night?  He is surely, and leaving me lonesome on the scruff of the hill. Isn't it long the nights are now, Shawn Keogh, to be leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of day?  If it is, when we're wedded in a short while you'll have no call to complain, for I've little will to be walking off to wakes or weddings in the darkness of the night.  You're making mighty certain, Shaneen, that I'll wed you now.  Aren't we after making a good bargain, the way we're only waiting these days on Father Reilly's dispensation from the bishops, or the Court of Rome.
EN358	1	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN359	1	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso.

Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School.

It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--
EN268	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night.  You should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and Spain.  We were great surely, with wide and windy acres of rich Munster land.  Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?  Is it me?  Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?  I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in the naked parish where I grew a man.  If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking, and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.  I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't fearing you at all.  You've said the like of that, maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.  I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine prancing women making laughter with the men.  If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.  You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you single now?  What would I want wedding so young?  We're alike, so.

The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.

Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my nose. It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about the rain, and Darcy the devil choke him--and the towering church. Give me that whisky. Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all?  Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.  Is it that?  It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a bad wife in the house.  Is it herself, master of the house, and she a grand woman to talk?  It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still. Let you wait now a short while, and it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. Is that somebody above?  There's a voice speaking on the path.  Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying. Be falling to sleep now and don't let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life.

It's above at the cross-roads he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him to Kate Cassidy's wake.  And he's going that length in the dark night?  He is surely, and leaving me lonesome on the scruff of the hill. Isn't it long the nights are now, Shawn Keogh, to be leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of day?

And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.  Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?  And so do I.  And so do you, hey?  Yes, sir; that is our wish.  Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.  You said you could give us anything we wished for.  But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine.

EN464	0	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.  Is it dead he is or living?

You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead. Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half in your skin.

EN467	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my nose. It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about the rain, and Darcy the devil choke him--and the towering church. Give me that whisky. Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all?  Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.  Is it that?  It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a bad wife in the house.  Is it herself, master of the house, and she a grand woman to talk?  It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still. Let you wait now a short while, and it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. Is that somebody above?  There's a voice speaking on the path.  Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying. Be falling to sleep now and don't let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life. I wouldn't have told you at all but it's destroyed with the drouth I was.  Have no fear, master of the house. What is it I know of the like of you that I'ld be saying a word or putting out my
EN460	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.

I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.

The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Then I run, and I run, and I run, till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.  God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.  It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain
EN463	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$You stick to me, Brocky, and I'll pull you through.  Monsieur Fleury.  The chef.  Very charmed to see you, Monsieur Fleury.  Thank you very much.  Agatha--recitation!  Mr. Rolleston.  How do you do, Rolleston?  Mr. Tompsett.  Miss Fisher.  This is a pleasure, Miss Fisher.  If I might venture, Miss Fisher  Miss Simmons.  You are always welcome, Miss Simmons.  At last we meet. Won't you sit down?  Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Charmed to see you, Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Mr. Treherne, this is Fisher, my maid.  Your what, Mary?  My friend. Thomas.  How do you do, Thomas?  John.  How do you do, John?  Brocklehurst, this is John. I think you have already met on the door-step.  Jane.  Give me your hand, Jane.  Gladys.  How do you do, Gladys. You know my uncle?  Your hand, Gladys.  Tweeny.  So happy to see you.  John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce me.  That's an uncommon pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.  No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.  They are not all here, Crichton.  Odds and ends. Which is to recite?  And how are all at home?  Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?  No, no, the family. How's the baby?  Blooming, your lordship.  A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice little fellow.  Beg pardon, my lord, it's a girl.  A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.  Very delighted to see you, Crichton.  Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?  Milk and sugar, Crichton?  I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.  To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful. Oh, please do speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?  It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.  I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.  I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.  Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything?  I have no idea, my lady.  But you laughed.  My lady, he is the second son of a peer.  Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.
EN149	1	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was courting each other just like the rest of yeez.  Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.  Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at him?  Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez are. Will you look at the red color in his face?  If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.  Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's a fine girl, if I do say it myself.  Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain to spake her piece.  LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.  Blessed old Santa Claus, king of delights, What are you doing these long winter nights? Filling your budgets with trinkets and toys, Wonderful gifts for the girls and the boys. While you are planning for everything nice, Pray let me give you a bit of advice.  Don't take it hard if I say in your ear, Santa, I thought you were partial last year; Loading the rich folks with everything gay, Snubbing the poor ones who came in your way. Now of all times of the year I am sure This is the time to remember the poor.
EN148	1	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$Humph! He's original in that opinion.  I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.
EN042	0	Gawd, I can't stand this! I better beat it.  Well, who's the blond?  Dat vas Anna, Larry.  Your daughter, Anna?  Don't you tank she vas pooty gel, Larry?  Sure! A peach!  You bet you! Give me drink for take back--one port vine for Anna--she calabrate dis one time with me--and small beer for me.  Small beer for you, eh? She's reformin' you already.  You bet! You look tired, Anna. Veil, Ay make you take good long rest now. Come, you drink vine. It put new life in you. Skoal, Anna! You know dat Svedish word?  Skoal! Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!       Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself. Let you walk out throughthat door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's hungry you are, or wanting a bed.  Maybe himself would take her.  What would he do with me now?  Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth.  Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born yourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have surely.  We'll be going now, lady of the house--the rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning by the grace of God.  What good is a grand morning when I'm destroyed surely, and I going out to get my death walking the roads?  You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house, and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold, and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking on each day, and it passing you by. You'll be saying one time, "It's a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--  Go out of that door, I'm telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.
EN043	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$How is his lordship now?  A little easier, sir.  Crichton, send Fisher to me.  I have no pity for you girls, I--  Ernest, go away, and don't insult the broken-hearted.  And uncommon glad I am to go. Ta-ta, all of you. He asked me to say a few words. I came here to say a few words, and I'm not at all sure that I couldn't bring an action against him.  My poor sisters, come here. We must make this draw us closer together. I shall do my best to help you in every way. Just now I cannot think of myself at all.  But how unlike you, Mary.  It is my duty to protect my sisters.  I never knew her so sweet before, Agatha. (Cautiously.) What do you propose to do, Mary?  I propose when we are on the yacht to lend Fisher to you when I don't need her myself.  Fisher?  Of course, as the eldest, I have decided that it is my maid we shall take with us.  Mary, you toad.  Nothing on earth would induce Fisher to lift her hand for either me or Catherine.  I was afraid of it, Agatha. That is why I am so sorry for you.  Fisher, you heard what his lordship said?  Yes, my lady.  You have given me some satisfaction of late, Fisher, and to mark my approval I have decided that you shall be the maid who accompanies us.  I thank you, my lady.  That is all; you may go.  If you please, my lady, I wish to give notice.  Oh, certainly--you may go.  But why, Fisher?  I could not undertake, my lady, to wait upon three. We don't do it. Oh, my lady, to think that this affront--  I thought I told you to go, Fisher.  Serves you right.  It will be Simmons after all. Send Simmons to me.  My lady, might I venture to speak?  What is it?  I happen to know, your ladyship, that Simmons desires to give notice for the same reason as Fisher.  Oh!  Then, Catherine, we take Jeanne.  And Jeanne also, my lady.  We can't blame them. Could any maid who respected herself be got to wait upon three?  I suppose there are such persons, Crichton?  I have heard, my lady, that there are such.  Crichton, what's to be done? We sail in two days; could one be discovered in the time?  Surely you can think of some one?  There is in this establishment, your ladyship, a young woman--  Yes?  A young woman, on whom I have for some time cast an eye.  Do you mean as a possible lady's-maid?  I had thought of her, my lady, in another connection.  Ah!  But I believe she is quite the young person you require. Perhaps if you could see her, my lady--  I shall certainly see her. Bring her to me. You two needn't wait.  Needn't we? We see your little game, Mary.  We shall certainly remain and have our two-thirds of her.  This, my lady, is the young person.  Oh dear!  Come here, girl. Don't be afraid.  Her appearance, my lady, is homely, and her manners, as you may have observed, deplorable, but she has a heart of gold.  What is your position downstairs?  I'm a tweeny, your ladyship.  A what?  A tweeny; that is to say, my lady, she is not at present, strictly speaking, anything; a between maid; she helps the vegetable maid. It is she, my lady, who conveys the dishes from the one end of the kitchen table, where they are placed by the cook, to the other end, where they enter into the charge of Thomas and John.  I see. And you and Crichton are--ah--keeping company?  A butler don't keep company, my lady.  Does he not?  No, your ladyship, we butlers may--(he makes a gesture with his arms)--but we do not keep company.  I know what it is; you are engaged?

I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of it on the ridge of his skull, and he went down at my feet like an empty sack, and never let a grunt or groan from him at all.  And what way weren't you hanged, mister? Did you bury him then?  Aye. I buried him then. Wasn't I digging spuds in the field?  And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that you're out?  Never a one of them, and I walking forward facing hog, dog, or divil on the highway of the road.  It's only with a common week-day kind of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase, and that man should be a great terror when his temper's roused.  He should then. And where was it, mister honey, that you did the deed?  Oh, a distant place, master of the house, a windy corner of high, distant hills.  He's a close man, and he's right, surely.  That'd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a pot-boy, Michael James, if it's the truth you're seeking one at all.  The peelers is fearing him, and if you'd that lad in the house there isn't one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard.  Bravery's a treasure in a lonesome place, and a lad would kill his father, I'm thinking, would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on the flags of hell.  It's the truth they're saying, and if I'd that lad in the house, I wouldn't be fearing the loosed kharki cut-throats, or the walking dead.  Well, glory be to God!  Would you think well to stop here and be pot-boy, mister honey, if we gave you good wages, and didn't destroy you with the weight of work?  That'd be a queer kind to bring into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike.  Will you whisht? Who's speaking to you?
EN041	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--

You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?

Ay love your mo'der too much for ever do dat, Anna.$$$'I'll try not to,'  'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong about me.'  'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'

As one individual?  As one individual.  Like this?  Something like that.  And we may take our friends with us, and give them places about the Court?  Undoubtedly. That's always done!  I'm convinced!  So am I!  Then the sooner we're off the better.  We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)--  Stop, stop--that won't do at all--ladies are not admitted.  What!  Not admitted. Not at present. Afterwards, perhaps. We'll see.  Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate us from our wives!  This is very awkward! Only for a time--a few months. Alter all, what is a few months?  But we've only been married half an hour!   Kind sir, you cannot have the heart Our lives to part From those to whom an hour ago We were united! Before our flowing hopes you stem, Ah, look at them, And pause before you deal this blow, All uninvited!

Ah me, you men will never understand That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!  Some kind of charm you seem to find In womankind-- Some source of unexplained delight (Unless you're jesting), But what attracts you, I confess, I cannot guess, To me a woman's face is quite Uninteresting! If from my sister I were torn, It could be borne-- I should, no doubt, be horrified, But I could bear it;-- But Marco's quite another thing-- He is my King, He has my heart and none beside Shall ever share it!

It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee Peter Pan.

EN048	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$The tide, Crichton, is a postman who calls at our island twice a day for letters.  Thank you, sir.  Poor Crichton! I sometimes think he is losing his sense of humour.

It is only Crichton knocking down trees.  Mary, let us go and stand beside him.  Let a servant see that I am afraid!  Don't, then; but remember this, dear, they often drop on one from above.  Crichton, Crichton!  Did you call, my lady?  I! Why should I?  I made a mistake, your ladyship. If you are afraid of being alone, my lady--  Afraid! Certainly not. You may go.  I wish, Crichton, you could work without getting so hot.  I wish I could, my lady.  It makes me hot to look at you.  It almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship.  Anything I can do for you in that way, Crichton, I shall do with pleasure.  Thank you, my lady.  Don't give way, my lady, things might be worse.  My poor father.  If I could have given my life for his.  You did all a man could do. Indeed I thank you, Crichton. You are a man.  Thank you, my lady.  But it is all so awful. Crichton, is there any hope of a ship coming?  Of course there is, my lady.  Don't treat me as a child. I have got to know the worst, and to face it. Crichton, the truth.  We were driven out of our course, my lady; I fear far from the track of commerce.  Thank you; I understand.  You're a good pluckt 'un, my lady.  I shall try to be. Crichton, how dare you?  I beg your ladyship's pardon; but you are.  And until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for you ladies.  Mr. Ernest does no work.  But he will, my lady.  I doubt it.  No work--no dinner--will make a great change in Mr. Ernest.  No work--no dinner. When did you invent that rule, Crichton?  I didn't invent it, my lady. I seem to see it growing all over the island.  Crichton, your manner strikes me as curious.  I hope not, your ladyship.  You are not implying anything so unnatural, I presume, as that if I and my sisters don't work there will be no dinner for us?  If it is unnatural, my lady, that is the end of it.  If? Now I understand. The perfect servant at home holds that we are all equal now. I see.  My lady, can you think me so inconsistent?  That is it.  My lady, I disbelieved in equality at home because it was against nature, and for that same reason I as utterly disbelieve in it on an island.  I apologise.  There must always, my lady, be one to command and others to obey.  One to command, others to obey. Yes. Crichton!  What is it, my lady?  Look what I found.  Cocoa-nuts. Bravo!  They grows on trees.  Where did you think they grew?  I thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks.
EN049	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$'That movement again! Don't you want me to go on?'  'Let us stop.'  'Not unless he wishes it. Why are those words so important? Does the message end there? Is any one working against you? Some one antagonistic? Yes. Not one of ourselves surely? No. Is it any one we know? Yes. Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of this person's name A?--B?----'  'Is the second letter A?'  'FA. Fa----?'  'Is the word Father? Yes.'  'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'  'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'  'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly antagonistic, is he?'  'I am afraid he is.'  'But he must admit that we do get messages.'  'He says we think we do. He says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'  'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'  'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'  'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'  'He said it was.'  'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'  'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't thinking of it at all.'  'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'  'I'll go.'  'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'  'As to that--as to that----'  'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'  'No, don't.'  'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'  'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'  'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'  'You see, Dick and I were not very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'  'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'  'I'll go.'  'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'  'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'  'No, no, don't.'  'It would be all right, Don.'  'I don't know.'  'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel I--should like to be alone.'  'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'  'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening. I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'  'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather not. Thanks, awfully.'  'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'  'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'  'Dick's fishing-rods.'  'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'  'That's all right, Grace.'  'I think I shall go to Laura now.'  'Yes,'  'Poor child!'  'I'm afraid I hurt her.'  'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'  'Why not, Grace?'  'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father.'  'I daresay.'  'How you can read about the war nowadays!'  'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's just that I can't believe in it.'  'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was to me.'  'I don't know.'  'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'
EN389	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my nose. It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about the rain, and Darcy the devil choke him--and the towering church. Give me that whisky. Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all?  Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.  Is it that?  It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a bad wife in the house.  Is it herself, master of the house, and she a grand woman to talk?  It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still. Let you wait now a short while, and it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. Is that somebody above?  There's a voice speaking on the path.  Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying. Be falling to sleep now and don't let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life. I wouldn't have told you at all but it's destroyed with the drouth I was.  Have no fear, master of the house. What is it I know of the like of you that I'ld be saying a word or putting out my
EN388	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my nose.

Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn.

You did nothing at all.  That's an unkindly thing to be saying to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging before, and hell's gap gaping below.  You're only saying it. You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the windpipe of a screeching sow.  You're not speaking the truth.  Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?  Don't strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the like of that.  Is it killed your father?  With the help of God I did surely, and that the Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.  There's a daring fellow.  Oh, glory be to God!  That was a hanging crime, mister honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.  He was a dirty man, God forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up with him at all.  And you shot him dead?  I never used weapons. I've no license, and I'm a law-fearing man.  It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world it's bloody knives they use.  Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?  You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers swearing it had life?
EN384	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?
EN387	0	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$There's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them, and he not reckoning them at all.  Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's gone?  It is surely.  That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath.  He was a great man surely, stranger, and isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man, and he mad dying?  It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.  I heard tell this day, Nora Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself.  It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.  I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in a lonesome place you live itself.  It's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men, for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day, Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.  Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man?  What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?
EN386	1	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee Peter Pan.  I am that. Here's the little, fat body. And here's the four legs. I'll just stick the legs on with nails--and there he stands. Now, here's a little potato for a head, and an ould skinny carrot for a trunk. I'll stick them on with a hair pin. Now, I'll stick on the ears and put in the shoe-button eyes, and with this wee bit of black paper for a tailpiece, and there ye are. Mr. Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan as natural as life and twice as handsome.  Here's a doll baby I've dressed, but it's no head she has at all, at all.  Use a big yellow apple or a wee yellow punkin, and put on a baby cap--and there ye are. Stick in some buttons for eyes, and a wee nose and mouth of red paper--and stick the head on the body with some hair pins, and the quane herself niver had a better doll baby.  I'll put her right here on the table alongside of the iliphant.  It's nine o'clock, it is. Isn't it time for the children to be home?  It is that. And here they come now.  The Mulligans are coming now, as happy as can be, We've been to the Sunday School and saw the Christmas tree, Had a lark with Santa Claus and take a tip from me, We'll all be marching on Christmas!  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here, Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year, And we'll be marching on Christmas!  Patsy got a trumpet, little Micky got a drum, Matsy got a spinning top, you ought to hear it hum, Clarissa got a candy cane, oh, won't we have the fun, When we are marching on Christmas!

EN381	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$There's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them, and he not reckoning them at all.

But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$A bloody-handed murderer the like of...

Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.  It's a nice room, and if it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.  Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door, and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk at the wake.  And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?  Christopher Mahon.  Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.  God bless you all.  God bless you.  Are you wanting me to stop along with you and keep you from harm?  Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?  There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it too.  You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step off nimble this time when there's none.  Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...  Go on, then, to Father Reilly, and let him put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.  If I meet the Widow Quin...  Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your noise.

EN382	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$'I'll try not to,'  'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong about me.'  'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN143	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself. Let you walk out throughthat door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's hungry you are, or wanting a bed.  Maybe himself would take her.  What would he do with me now?  Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth.  Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born yourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have surely.  We'll be going now, lady of the house--the rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning by the grace of God.  What good is a grand morning when I'm destroyed surely, and I going out to get my death walking the roads?  You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house, and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold, and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking on each day, and it passing you by. You'll be saying one time, "It's a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--  Go out of that door, I'm telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.
EN142	0	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.

The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN141	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself. Let you walk out throughthat door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's hungry you are, or wanting a bed.  Maybe himself would take her.  What would he do with me now?

The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?  Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big, tall little girl.  A great, big tall little girl, hey?  And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.  Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?  And so do I.  And so do you, hey?  Yes, sir; that is our wish.  Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.  You said you could give us anything we wished for.  But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.  That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.  Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.  Marble?  Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.  We have a marble-top table in the front hall.  Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.  But I have to stand here by the open window.  Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?  Yes, all of us.  All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine. Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll see what I can do for you.

Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat.

Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.

We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Of the child that is born, O Baltasar, I begged a woman to tell us the news; I said in the east we had seen His star, And had ridden fast and had ridden far To find and worship the King of the Jews.  Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star Is standing still over this lowly hut.  Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!  What ho, within!  Sirs, whom seek ye?   We have journeyed from afar Led by the shining of yon splendid star. We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.   We seek a new-born King, Gold, frankincense to him we bring. And many a kingly offering.  Behold, the child is clothed in light!   Our journey ends, passed is the night.   Now let us make no more delay, But worship Him right worthily.   Hail, hail, dear child Of a maiden meek and mild. See, he merries! See, he smiles, my sweeting, I give thee greeting! Have a bob of cherries.   Hail, little One we've sought, See, a bird I've brought, See its feathers gay. Hail, little One adored, Hail, blessed King and Lord, Star of the day!   Hail, little One, so dear, My heart is full of cheer, A little ball I bring, Reach forth thy fingers gay, And take the ball and play, My blessed King. I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings, And here a scepter full of gems, For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!   And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    The greatest gift is yet ungiven, The gift that cometh straight from Heaven. O, Heavenly King, Heart's love we bring.   Not gold nor gems from land or sea Is worth the love we offer Thee.   And lowly folk who have no gold, Nor gift to offer that is meet, May bring the dearest thing of all-- A loving heart and service sweet.

But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.   I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite, If any wonders you have seen this night?  I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light  Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.  Tell me, for thou art native of this place, What dost thou know about the King of Grace-- King of the Jews?   Aye, in Jerusalem He dwells, and not in Bethlehem. He sits upon his mighty judgment throne, Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.   I mean a new-born King, of love and peace; His is the star--His reign shall never cease.   All things tonight seem passing strange to me, I have just read an ancient prophecy That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town, Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown, Of one called Councillor of King David's line Whose coming is foretold in words divine. And now you come with words of mystery! Why should thy questions, which are dark to me, Cause me to think of Him?   The star! The star! No more it moves about the heavens afar, It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray, For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!   His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within And seek protection in my humble inn.    Three kings came riding from far away, Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar; Three wise men out of the east were they, And they traveled by night and they slept by day, For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.   The star was so beautiful, large and clear, That all other stars of the sky Became a white mist in the atmosphere; And by this they knew that the coming was near Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.
EN145	0	Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$In the regrettable slang of the servants' hall, my lady, the master is usually referred to as the Gov.  I see. You--  Yes, I understand that is what they call me.  You didn't even take your meals with the family?  No, my lady, I dined apart.  You, girl, also? Did you dine with Crichton?  No, your ladyship.  With whom?  I took my bit of supper with--with Daddy and Polly and the rest.  Dear old Daddy--he was our monkey. You remember our monkey, Agatha?  Rather! What a funny old darling he was.  And don't you think Polly was the sweetest little parrot, Mary?  Ah! I understand; animals you had domesticated?  Quite so--quite so.  The servants' teas that used to take place here once a month--  They did not seem natural on the island, my lady, and were discontinued by the Gov.'s orders.  A clear proof, Loam, that they were a mistake here.  I admit it frankly. I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I think of going over to the Tories.  I am delighted to hear it.  Thank you, Crichton, thank you; that is all.  One moment. Young people, Crichton, will be young people, even on an island; now, I suppose there was a certain amount of--shall we say sentimentalising, going on? Yes, my lady, there was.  Mother!  Which gentleman? You, girl, tell me.  If you please, my lady--  The fact is--  It was him--Mr. Ernest, your ladyship.  With which lady?  I have already told you, Lady Brocklehurst, that Ernest and I--  Yes, now; but you were two years on the island. Was it this lady?  No, your ladyship.  Then I don't care which of the others it was. Well, I suppose that will do.  Do! I hope you are ashamed of yourself, mother. You are an excellent fellow, Crichton; and if, after we are married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.  Oh no, impossible--  Why impossible? Do you see why it should be impossible, my man?  Yes, my lady. I had not told you, my lord, but as soon as your lordship is suited I wish to leave service.  What will you do, Crichton?  Shall I withdraw, my lord?  Horrid of me, wasn't it? But if one wasn't disagreeable now and again, it would be horribly tedious to be an old woman. He will soon be yours, Mary, and then--think of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to me. On that understanding, my dear, don't you think we might--?  Quite so--quite so. To wish you every dear happiness.  The same to you, my lady.  Do you despise me, Crichton? You are the best man among us.  On an island, my lady, perhaps; but in England, no.  Then there's something wrong with England.  My lady, not even from you can I listen to a word against England.  Tell me one thing: you have not lost your courage?  No, my lady.
EN144	0	I'll do it, Annie--for your sake--if you say it's needful for ye.  God bless you for that, David!  The ice is breakin' up to no'the'ard, sir. There's a clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond, the lookout says.  A clear passage? To no'the'ard?  Yes, sir.  Then get her ready and we'll drive her through.  Aye, aye, sir.  David! David!  Will the men turn to willin' or must we drag 'em out?  They'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God into 'em, sir. They're meek as lambs.  KEENEY. Then drive 'em--both watches. [_With grim determination._] They's whale t'other side o' this floe and we're agoin' to git 'em.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir.  And I was agoin' home like a yaller dog!  David!  Woman, you ain't adoin' right when you meddle in men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I got to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in. I got to git the ile, I tell ye. David! Aren't you going home?  You ain't well. Go and lay down a mite. I got to git on deck.  David!  Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? Annie! What is it? Don't you know me, Annie?  You said--you was agoin' mad--God!  Whales, sir--a whole school of 'em--off the star-b'd quarter 'bout five miles away--big ones!  Are you lowerin' the boats?  MATE. Yes, sir.  I'm acomin' with ye.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir. You'll git the ile now right enough, sir.  Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git the ile. [I know you're foolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind--be you? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while longer, Annie--then we'll turn home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?  All ready, sir.  Comin', sir?$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?
EN262	0	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN263	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$'I have come back, John, It hasn't seemed very long, has it?'  'No, not long, Ellen. Had you a nice walk?'  'I haven't been for a walk. Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'  'Yes, it was to a wedding.'  'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'  'Tell me, Ellen.'  'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'  'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'  'I thought you might be a little troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet strings.'  'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'  'It _is_ funny, John. I ran back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.'  'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'  'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'  'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'  'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'  'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too old yet.'  'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.'  'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard nothing.'  'Dering?'  'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'  'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'  'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'  'They have all gone to the war, John.'  'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'  'Oh, John!'  'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'  'Yes, I know, John.'  He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes here. He is a captain.'  'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'  'She has soon forgotten.'  'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'  'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'  'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'  'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'  'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may even have killed each other.'  'They hadn't known, Ellen.'  'I daresay they knew.'  'Billy boy and Karl!'  'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'  'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'  'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'  'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here, John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'  'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'  'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.'  'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'  'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'  'No, no, let's pretend.'  'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little touchy about that.'  'Not a word!'  'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'  'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'  'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'  'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'  'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'  'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'  'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'

You gat moonlight at night, maybe; see steamer pass; see schooner make sail--see everytang dat's pooty. You need take rest like dat. You work too hard for young gel already. You need vacation, yes!  It sounds good to hear you tell it. I'd sure like a trip on the water, all right. It's the barge idea has me stopped. Well, I'll go down with you and have a look--and maybe I'll take a chance. Gee, I'd do anything once.  Ye go, eh?  What's the rush? Wait a second. Gee, I'm thirsty.  Ay'm sorry, Anna. What you tank you like for drink, eh?  I'll take a--[ I don't know. What'a they got here?  Ay don't tank dey got much fancy drink for young gel in dis place, Anna. Yinger ale--sas'prilla, maybe.  Make it sas, then.  CAy tal you, Anna, we calabrate, yes--dis one time because we meet after many year. Dey gat good port wine, Anna. It's good for you. Ay tank--little bit--for give you appetite. It ain't strong, neider. One glass don't go to your head, Ay promise.  All right! I'll take port.  Ay go gat him.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--
EN261	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$'That movement again! Don't you want me to go on?'  'Let us stop.'  'Not unless he wishes it. Why are those words so important? Does the message end there? Is any one working against you? Some one antagonistic? Yes. Not one of ourselves surely? No. Is it any one we know? Yes. Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of this person's name A?--B?----'  'Is the second letter A?'  'FA. Fa----?'  'Is the word Father? Yes.'  'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'  'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'  'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly antagonistic, is he?'  'I am afraid he is.'  'But he must admit that we do get messages.'  'He says we think we do. He says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'  'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'  'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'  'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'  'He said it was.'  'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'  'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't thinking of it at all.'  'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'  'I'll go.'  'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'  'As to that--as to that----'  'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'  'No, don't.'  'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'  'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'  'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'  'You see, Dick and I were not very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'  'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'  'I'll go.'  'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'  'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'  'No, no, don't.'  'It would be all right, Don.'  'I don't know.'  'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel I--should like to be alone.'  'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'  'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening. I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'  'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather not. Thanks, awfully.'  'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'  'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'  'Dick's fishing-rods.'  'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'  'That's all right, Grace.'  'I think I shall go to Laura now.'  'Yes,'  'Poor child!'  'I'm afraid I hurt her.'  'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'  'Why not, Grace?'  'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father.'  'I daresay.'  'How you can read about the war nowadays!'  'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's just that I can't believe in it.'  'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was to me.'  'I don't know.'  'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'
EN266	1	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold.  Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.  God rest his soul.  Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.  The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.  I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.  Thank you kindly, lady of the house.  Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.  I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.  Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?  There's no offence, lady of the house?  No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all?
EN267	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$I perceive, from the tea cups, Crichton, that the great function is to take place here.  Yes, sir.  The servants' hall coming up to have tea in the drawing-room! No wonder you look happy, Crichton.  No, sir.  Do you know, Crichton, I think that with an effort you might look even happier. You don't approve of his lordship's compelling his servants to be his equals--once a month?  It is not for me, sir, to disapprove of his lordship's radical views.  Certainly not. And, after all, it is only once a month that he is affable to you.  On all other days of the month, sir, his lordship's treatment of us is everything that could be desired. Tea cups! Life, Crichton, is like a cup of tea; the more heartily we drink, the sooner we reach the dregs.  Thank you, sir.  as we do when we have need of an ally). Crichton, in case I should be asked to say a few words to the servants, I have strung together a little speech. I was wondering where I should stand.  with the best intentions, gives him a footstool to stand on, and departs, happily unconscious that ERNEST in some dudgeon has kicked the footstool across the room.)  Suppose you were all little fishes at the bottom of the sea  And how are my little friends to-day?  Don't be silly, Ernest. If you want to know how we are, we are dead. Even to think of entertaining the servants is so exhausting.  Besides which, we have had to decide what frocks to take with us on the yacht, and that is such a mental strain.  You poor over-worked things. Rest your weary limbs.  But why have you a footstool in your hand?  Yes?  Why? You see, as the servants are to be the guests I must be butler. I was practising. This is a tray, observe.  Tea, my lady? It is only you, Ernest; I thought there was some one here.  Had a very tiring day also, Mary?  Dreadfully. Been trying on engagement-rings all the morning.  What's that? Is it Brocklehurst?  You have given your warm young heart to Brocky?  I don't wish to fatigue you, Mary, by insisting on a verbal answer, but if, without straining yourself, you can signify Yes or No, won't you make the effort?  The ring! Then I am too late, too late! (Fixing LADY MARY sternly, like a prosecuting counsel.) May I ask, Mary, does Brocky know? Of course, it was that terrible mother of his who pulled this through. Mother does everything for Brocky. Still, in the eyes of the law you will be, not her wife, but his, and, therefore, I hold that Brocky ought to be informed. Now--  If you girls are shamming sleep in the expectation that I shall awaken you in the manner beloved of ladies, abandon all such hopes.  You impertinent boy.  I knew that was it, though I don't know everything. Agatha, I'm not young enough to know everything.  Young enough?  Don't you see? I'm not young enough to know
EN264	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned. Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?  What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
EN265	0	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$The tide, Crichton, is a postman who calls at our island twice a day for letters.  Thank you, sir.  Poor Crichton! I sometimes think he is losing his sense of humour. Come along, Agatha.  How horribly still it is.  It is best when it is still.  Mary, I have heard that they are always very still just before they jump.  Don't.  It is only Crichton knocking down trees.  Mary, let us go and stand beside him.  Let a servant see that I am afraid!  Don't, then; but remember this, dear, they often drop on one from above.  Crichton, Crichton!  Did you call, my lady?  I! Why should I?  I made a mistake, your ladyship. If you are afraid of being alone, my lady--  Afraid! Certainly not. You may go.  I wish, Crichton, you could work without getting so hot.  I wish I could, my lady.  It makes me hot to look at you.  It almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship.  Anything I can do for you in that way, Crichton, I shall do with pleasure.  Thank you, my lady.  Don't give way, my lady, things might be worse.  My poor father.  If I could have given my life for his.  You did all a man could do. Indeed I thank you, Crichton. You are a man.  Thank you, my lady.  But it is all so awful. Crichton, is there any hope of a ship coming?  Of course there is, my lady.  Don't treat me as a child. I have got to know the worst, and to face it. Crichton, the truth.  We were driven out of our course, my lady; I fear far from the track of commerce.  Thank you; I understand.  You're a good pluckt 'un, my lady.  I shall try to be. Crichton, how dare you?  I beg your ladyship's pardon; but you are.  And until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for you ladies.  Mr. Ernest does no work.  But he will, my lady.  I doubt it.  No work--no dinner--will make a great change in Mr. Ernest.  No work--no dinner. When did you invent that rule, Crichton?  I didn't invent it, my lady. I seem to see it growing all over the island.  Crichton, your manner strikes me as curious.  I hope not, your ladyship.  You are not implying anything so unnatural, I presume, as that if I and my sisters don't work there will be no dinner for us?  If it is unnatural, my lady, that is the end of it.  If? Now I understand. The perfect servant at home holds that we are all equal now. I see.  My lady, can you think me so inconsistent?  That is it.  My lady, I disbelieved in equality at home because it was against nature, and for that same reason I as utterly disbelieve in it on an island.  I apologise.  There must always, my lady, be one to command and others to obey.  One to command, others to obey. Yes. Crichton!  What is it, my lady?  Look what I found.  Cocoa-nuts. Bravo!  They grows on trees.  Where did you think they grew?  I thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks.
EN316	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.  Is it dead he is or living?  It's little you care if it's dead or living I am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke, and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that you'll put in your foot through it again.  It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man, master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads?  Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life, I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.  The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a ditch.  What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead. Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half in your skin.
EN317	1	Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.
EN314	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother. I was just like her when I was that age.  And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.  Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I think the show is about to begin. Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical! Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical! Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks! Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks! Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled, Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld, The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man, Aerial Artists from far-off Japan, Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun, Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!  Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old, to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcel post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife.

Let you be making yourself easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming again.  Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.  There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?  It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!  Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.  I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?   Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.  Is it not dead you are?  How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?

You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house, and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth....

You'll be saying one time, "It's a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--  Go out of that door, I'm telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.
EN313	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.
EN310	0	Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.  Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.  It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.  Here they are, daddy.  Now, where's the tree?  There she is. Isn't she a beauty?  Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.  There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.  Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!  Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!  Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!    Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!  Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?  Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.  And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.  Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.  And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.  Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?
EN311	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.  Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.   Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.  Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.  The whole tin of them?  Patsy and Matsy, And Teddy Magee, Nora Eudora, And Micky Machree, Bridget Honora, And sweet Mary Ann, Melissa, Clarissa,  And wee Peter Pan.  And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?  All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.  Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.  I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.  Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.  If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
EN318	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself. Let you walk out throughthat door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's hungry you are, or wanting a bed.  Maybe himself would take her.  What would he do with me now?  Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth.  Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born yourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have surely.  We'll be going now, lady of the house--the rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning by the grace of God.  What good is a grand morning when I'm destroyed surely, and I going out to get my death walking the roads?  You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house, and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold, and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking on each day, and it passing you by. You'll be saying one time, "It's a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--  Go out of that door, I'm telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.

Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star Is standing still over this lowly hut.  Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!  What ho, within!  Sirs, whom seek ye?   We have journeyed from afar Led by the shining of yon splendid star. We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.   We seek a new-born King, Gold, frankincense to him we bring. And many a kingly offering.  Behold, the child is clothed in light!   Our journey ends, passed is the night.   Now let us make no more delay, But worship Him right worthily.   Hail, hail, dear child Of a maiden meek and mild. See, he merries! See, he smiles, my sweeting, I give thee greeting! Have a bob of cherries.   Hail, little One we've sought, See, a bird I've brought, See its feathers gay. Hail, little One adored, Hail, blessed King and Lord, Star of the day!   Hail, little One, so dear, My heart is full of cheer, A little ball I bring, Reach forth thy fingers gay, And take the ball and play, My blessed King. I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings, And here a scepter full of gems, For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!   And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    The greatest gift is yet ungiven, The gift that cometh straight from Heaven. O, Heavenly King, Heart's love we bring.   Not gold nor gems from land or sea Is worth the love we offer Thee.   And lowly folk who have no gold, Nor gift to offer that is meet, May bring the dearest thing of all-- A loving heart and service sweet.

I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.  Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?  Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.  And don't you have any other place to go this year?  I hope not.

I'm thinking it's myself will be wheezing that time with lying down under the Heavens when the night is cold; but you've a fine bit of talk, stranger, and it's with yourself I'll go.  You think it's a grand thing you're after doing with your letting on to be dead, but what is it at all? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this place, and she not making a talk with the men passing? And what way will yourself live from this day, with none to care for you? What is it you'll have now but a black life, Daniel Burke, and it's not long I'm telling you, till you'll be lying again under that sheet, and you dead surely.

There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.

I got drunk that night, I got drunk in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races beyond--and the third day they found Darcy....

God spare Darcy, he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome.  Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you coming from Aughrim?  There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he running after them this way and that.  Far down, stranger?  A piece only.  Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself.  I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.  I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.

You poor over-worked things. Rest your weary limbs.  But why have you a footstool in your hand?  Yes?  Why? You see, as the servants are to be the guests I must be butler. I was practising. This is a tray, observe.  Tea, my lady? It is only you, Ernest; I thought there was some one here.  Had a very tiring day also, Mary?  Dreadfully. Been trying on engagement-rings all the morning.  What's that? Is it Brocklehurst?  You have given your warm young heart to Brocky?  I don't wish to fatigue you, Mary, by insisting on a verbal answer, but if, without straining yourself, you can signify Yes or No, won't you make the effort?  The ring! Then I am too late, too late! (Fixing LADY MARY sternly, like a prosecuting counsel.) May I ask, Mary, does Brocky know? Of course, it was that terrible mother of his who pulled this through. Mother does everything for Brocky. Still, in the eyes of the law you will be, not her wife, but his, and, therefore, I hold that Brocky ought to be informed. Now--  If you girls are shamming sleep in the expectation that I shall awaken you in the manner beloved of ladies, abandon all such hopes.  You impertinent boy.  I knew that was it, though I don't know everything. Agatha, I'm not young enough to know everything.  Young enough?  Don't you see? I'm not young enough to know
EN032	0	I don't remember nothing about her. What was she like? Tell me.  Ay tal you all about everytang--and you tal me all tangs happen to you. But not here now. Dis ain't good place for young gel, anyway. Only no good sailor fallar come here for gat drunk. You come with me, Anna. You need lie down, gat rest.  Where're you going?  CHRIS--Come. Ve gat on board.  On board your barge, you mean? Nix for mine! Do you think that's a good place for a young girl like me--a coal barge?  Yes, Ay tank. You don't know how nice it's on barge, Anna. Tug come and ve gat towed out on voyage--yust water all round, and sun, and fresh air, and good grub for make you strong, healthy gel. You see many tangs you don't see before. You gat moonlight at night, maybe; see steamer pass; see schooner make sail--see everytang dat's pooty. You need take rest like dat. You work too hard for young gel already. You need vacation, yes!  It sounds good to hear you tell it. I'd sure like a trip on the water, all right. It's the barge idea has me stopped. Well, I'll go down with you and have a look--and maybe I'll take a chance. Gee, I'd do anything once.  Ye go, eh?  What's the rush? Wait a second. Gee, I'm thirsty.  Ay'm sorry, Anna. What you tank you like for drink, eh?  I'll take a--[ I don't know. What'a they got here?  Ay don't tank dey got much fancy drink for young gel in dis place, Anna. Yinger ale--sas'prilla, maybe.  Make it sas, then.  CAy tal you, Anna, we calabrate, yes--dis one time because we meet after many year. Dey gat good port wine, Anna. It's good for you. Ay tank--little bit--for give you appetite. It ain't strong, neider. One glass don't go to your head, Ay promise.  All right! I'll take port.  Ay go gat him.$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?
EN031	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.
EN030	1	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."
EN037	1	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$There's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them, and he not reckoning them at all.  Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's gone?  It is surely.  That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath.  He was a great man surely, stranger, and isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man, and he mad dying?  It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.  I heard tell this day, Nora Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself.  It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.  I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in a lonesome place you live itself.  It's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men, for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day, Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.  Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man?  What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?

I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.  It's a she, eh?  Yes.  Young?  Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other thing I know. So there!  Carmody?  Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the state from your town.  Miss Howard.  Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.  I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----  We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the last train, didn't you?  Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.  Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me----  Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.  No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.  I--I didn't know----  Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more than a moment.

It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$That's five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It's not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke, and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good.  What was it you got?  Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.  Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.  It's a pitiful thing to be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me, Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.  It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist, but it's a fine life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....  Son of God deliver us.  Now you'll not marry her the time I'm rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.

Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.  You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.  Yes, my lady.  And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought that--that father needed to be kept in his place?  I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for the house.  Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our gratitude.  If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.  Oh dear, what a tiring day.  I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.  I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.  Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.  I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master, and the same persons might not be servants.  Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature would decide.  I wonder-- This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev. This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.  John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell, which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat. What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings, and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark'--  Please don't describe our garments.  --'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up.)  But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father.  Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--  Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.  --'By night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--  And Ernest is sitting on it.  H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar.'  Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep?  No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward. Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea.  The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.  Anything wrong, sir?

Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  Hello, what is it?  It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$The tide, Crichton, is a postman who calls at our island twice a day for letters.  Thank you, sir.  Poor Crichton! I sometimes think he is losing his sense of humour. Come along, Agatha.  How horribly still it is.  It is best when it is still.  Mary, I have heard that they are always very still just before they jump.  Don't.  It is only Crichton knocking down trees.  Mary, let us go and stand beside him.  Let a servant see that I am afraid!  Don't, then; but remember this, dear, they often drop on one from above.  Crichton, Crichton!  Did you call, my lady?  I! Why should I?  I made a mistake, your ladyship. If you are afraid of being alone, my lady--  Afraid! Certainly not. You may go.  I wish, Crichton, you could work without getting so hot.  I wish I could, my lady.  It makes me hot to look at you.  It almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship.  Anything I can do for you in that way, Crichton, I shall do with pleasure.  Thank you, my lady.  Don't give way, my lady, things might be worse.  My poor father.  If I could have given my life for his.  You did all a man could do. Indeed I thank you, Crichton. You are a man.  Thank you, my lady.  But it is all so awful. Crichton, is there any hope of a ship coming?  Of course there is, my lady.  Don't treat me as a child. I have got to know the worst, and to face it. Crichton, the truth.  We were driven out of our course, my lady; I fear far from the track of commerce.  Thank you; I understand.  You're a good pluckt 'un, my lady.  I shall try to be. Crichton, how dare you?  I beg your ladyship's pardon; but you are.  And until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for you ladies.  Mr. Ernest does no work.  But he will, my lady.  I doubt it.  No work--no dinner--will make a great change in Mr. Ernest.  No work--no dinner. When did you invent that rule, Crichton?  I didn't invent it, my lady. I seem to see it growing all over the island.  Crichton, your manner strikes me as curious.  I hope not, your ladyship.  You are not implying anything so unnatural, I presume, as that if I and my sisters don't work there will be no dinner for us?  If it is unnatural, my lady, that is the end of it.  If? Now I understand. The perfect servant at home holds that we are all equal now. I see.  My lady, can you think me so inconsistent?  That is it.  My lady, I disbelieved in equality at home because it was against nature, and for that same reason I as utterly disbelieve in it on an island.  I apologise.  There must always, my lady, be one to command and others to obey.  One to command, others to obey. Yes. Crichton!  What is it, my lady?  Look what I found.  Cocoa-nuts. Bravo!  They grows on trees.  Where did you think they grew?  I thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks.
EN403	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--

I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.

There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.

Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does.

I do feel sort of--nutty, to-night. I feel old.  Old?  Sure--like I'd been living a long, long time--out here in the fog. I don't know how to tell you yust what I mean. It's like I'd come home after a long visit away some place. It all seems like I'd been here before lots of times--on boats--in this same fog. You must think I'm off my base.  Anybody feel funny dat vay in fog.  But why d'you s'pose I feel so--so--like I'd found something I'd missed and been looking for--'s if this was the right place for me to fit in? And I seem to have forgot--everything that's happened--like it didn't matter no more. And I feel clean, somehow--like you feel yust after you've took a bath. And I feel happy for once--yes, honest!--happier than I ever been anywhere before! It's nutty for me to feel that way, don't you think?  Ay tank Ay'm damn fool for bring you on voyage, Anna.

At last we meet. Won't you sit down?  Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Charmed to see you, Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Mr. Treherne, this is Fisher, my maid.  Your what, Mary?  My friend. Thomas.  How do you do, Thomas?  John.  How do you do, John?  Brocklehurst, this is John. I think you have already met on the door-step.  Jane.  Give me your hand, Jane.  Gladys.  How do you do, Gladys. You know my uncle?  Your hand, Gladys.  Tweeny.  So happy to see you.  John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce me.  That's an uncommon pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.  No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.  They are not all here, Crichton.  Odds and ends. Which is to recite?  And how are all at home?  Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?  No, no, the family. How's the baby?  Blooming, your lordship.  A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice little fellow.  Beg pardon, my lord, it's a girl.  A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.  Very delighted to see you, Crichton.  Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?  Milk and sugar, Crichton?  I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.  To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful. Oh, please do speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?  It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.  I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.  I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.  Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything?  I have no idea, my lady.  But you laughed.  My lady, he is the second son of a peer.  Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.
EN105	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.

You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?

It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about the rain, and Darcy the devil choke him--and the towering church. Give me that whisky. Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all?  Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.  Is it that?  It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a bad wife in the house.  Is it herself, master of the house, and she a grand woman to talk?  It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still. Let you wait now a short while, and it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. Is that somebody above?  There's a voice speaking on the path.  Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying. Be falling to sleep now and don't let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life.

The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.  I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  No, I cannot see a single thing.  Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  I can't see a thing.  Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?  Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.  Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.  Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?  Yes, I believe it is.$$$At last we have arrived at our destination. This is the Ducal Palace, and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor resides. As a Castilian hidalgo of ninety-five quarterings, I regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse. As a Castilian hidalgo of that description, I should have preferred to ride through the streets of Venice; but owing, I presume, to an unusually wet season, the streets are in such a condition that equestrian exercise is impracticable. No matter. Where is our suite? Your Grace, I am here.  Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when you address His Grace? My love, it is so small a matter! Still, you may as well do it.  The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian hidalgo.  My child, you are hard upon our suite.  Papa, I've no patience with the presumption of persons in his plebeian position. If he does not appreciate that position, let him be whipped until he does.  And you'll discover never A tale so free from every doubt-- All probable, possible shadow of doubt-- All possible doubt whatever!  A tale free from every doubt, etc.  Then do you mean to say that I am married to one of two gondoliers, but it is impossible to say which?  Without any doubt of any kind whatever. But be reassured: the nurse to whom your husband was entrusted is the mother of the musical young man who is such a past-master of that delicately modulated instrument (indicating the drum). She can, no doubt, establish the King's identity beyond all question.  Heavens, how did he know that?  My young friend, a Grand Inquisitor is always up to date. His mother is at present the wife of a highly respectable and old-established brigand, who carries on an extensive practice in the mountains around Cordova. Accompanied by two of my emissaries, he will set off at once for his mother's address. She will return with them, and if she finds any difficulty in making up her mind, the persuasive influence of the torture chamber will jog her memory.

There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$hand to stay you at all?  Stranger.  Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.  I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.  You were middling long, lady of the house.  There was no sign from himself?  No sign at all, lady of the house.  Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.  I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.  Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man, stranger, or will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain.  Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.  That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor tailor you are with it.  If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.  Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.  It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed, Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.

The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.  Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.  But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?$$$This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.   I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite, If any wonders you have seen this night?  I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light  Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.  Tell me, for thou art native of this place, What dost thou know about the King of Grace-- King of the Jews?   Aye, in Jerusalem He dwells, and not in Bethlehem. He sits upon his mighty judgment throne, Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.   I mean a new-born King, of love and peace; His is the star--His reign shall never cease.   All things tonight seem passing strange to me, I have just read an ancient prophecy That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town, Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown, Of one called Councillor of King David's line Whose coming is foretold in words divine. And now you come with words of mystery! Why should thy questions, which are dark to me, Cause me to think of Him?   The star! The star! No more it moves about the heavens afar, It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray, For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!   His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within And seek protection in my humble inn.    Three kings came riding from far away, Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar; Three wise men out of the east were they, And they traveled by night and they slept by day, For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.   The star was so beautiful, large and clear, That all other stars of the sky Became a white mist in the atmosphere; And by this they knew that the coming was near Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.
EN100	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Oh Tweeny, Tweeny!  Have I offended of your feelings again, sir?  A little.  I'm full o' vulgar words and ways; and though I may keep them in their holes when you are by, as soon as I'm by myself out they comes in a rush like beetles when the house is dark. I says them gloating-like, in my head--'Blooming' I says, and 'All my eye,' and 'Ginger,' and 'Nothink'; and all the time we was being wrecked I was praying to myself, 'Please the Lord it may be an island as it's natural to be vulgar on.'  That's the kind I am, sir. I'm 'opeless. You'd better give me up.  I won't give you up. It is strange that one so common should attract one so fastidious; but so it is. There is something about you, Tweeny, there is a je ne sais quoi about you.  Is there, is there? Oh, I am glad.  We shall fight your vulgarity together.

He produces an odd lens from his pocket, and tries to focus the sun's rays.)  Why, what's that?  That's the glass from my watch and one from Mr. Treherne's, with a little water between them. I'm hoping to kindle a fire with it.  Oh sir!  Danger! Crichton, a tiger-cat!  Where?  It is at our heels.  Look out, Crichton.  H'sh!  It will be on us in a moment. Listen!  The grass is moving. It's coming.  Father.  Mary--Catherine--Agatha. Oh dear, my dears, my dears, oh dear!  Darling.  Sweetest.  Love.  Glad to see you, sir.  Uncle, uncle, dear old uncle.  Ernest thought you were a tiger-cat.  Oh, did you? I knew you at once, Ernest; I knew you by the way you ran.  My lord, I am glad.  But you are also idling, Crichton. We mustn't waste time. To work, to work.  Yes, sir.  Ernest, you be a little more civil. Crichton, let me help.  Is that--but I suppose I'm dreaming again. It isn't by any chance a pot on top of a fire, is it?  Indeed, it is, dearest. It is our supper.  I have been dreaming of a pot on a fire for two days. There 's nothing in it, is there?  Sniff, uncle.  It smells of onions!  Father, you have boots!  So he has.  Of course I have.  You are actually wearing boots, uncle. It's very unsafe, you know, in this climate.  Is it?  We have all abandoned them, you observe. The blood, the arteries, you know.  I hadn't a notion.  O Lord, yes.  Father, he is trying to get your boots from you. There is nothing in the world we wouldn't give for boots.  I only wanted the loan of them.  If you lend them to any one, it will be to us, won't it, father.  Certainly, my child.  Oh, very well. I don't want your old boots. You don't think you could spare me one boot?  I do not.  Quite so. Well, all I can say is I'm sorry for you.  Father, we thought we should never see you again.  I was washed ashore, my dear, clinging to a hencoop. How awful that first night was.  Poor father.  When I woke, I wept. Then I began to feel extremely hungry. There was a large turtle on the beach. I remembered from the Swiss Family Robinson that if you turn a turtle over he is helpless. My dears, I crawled towards him, I flung myself upon him the nasty, spiteful brute.

That dame was here told me you was captain of a coal barge--and you wrote me you was yanitor of a building!  Oh, Ay work on land long time as yanitor. Yust short time ago Ay got dis yob cause Ay vas sick, need open air.  Sick? You? You'd never think it.  And, Anna, dis ain't real sailor yob. Dis ain't real boat on sea.

You feel better now, dough, don't you? You look little tired, dat's all!  I am. Tired to death. I need a long rest and I don't see much chance of getting it.  What you mean, Anna?  Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?

Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.  I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.  This light shall burn on Christmas Day, For Him who in the manger lay, And all are welcome at my door, The high, the low, the rich, the poor, And every heart shall sing again Of peace on earth, good will to men.  Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?   Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty, Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty? A three-legged stool and a table to match it, But the door of the shanty is always unlatched. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!  Our nate little house, it looks out on the street, There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete. Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat, There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat. Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!   It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks we can be having afterwards.  Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?  He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till marnin'.
EN459	0	Three weeks of your days might be long, surely, yet seven years are a short space for the like of Naisi and myself.  If they're a short space there aren't many the like of you. Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out every morning till she'd meet a stranger and see the flame of courtship leaping up within his eye? Tell me now, are you well pleased that length with the same man snorting next you at the dawn of day?  Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw- ing light across the branches at the dawn of day? It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for a short space we have the same things only. Yet the earth itself is a silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and talker.  Well, go, take your choice. Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to Conchubor in Emain. Conchubor's a wrinkled fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes falling downward from his shining crown; Naisi should be stale and weary. Yet there are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living on without a touch of kindness from your eyes and voice. It's a poor thing to be so lonesome you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.  Are there no women like yourself could be your friends in Emain?  There are none like you, Deirdre. It's for that I'm asking are you going back this night with Fergus?  I will go where Naisi chooses.  It's Naisi, Naisi, is it? Then, I tell you, you'll have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he looking on yourself. Would you credit it, my father used to be in the broom and heather kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping out above their heads, and now she'd scare a raven from a carcase on a hill. Queens get old, Deirdre, with their white and long arms going from them, and their backs hooping. I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust is in the air. I'll give you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as ugly and old as Conchubor? You've no answer? . . . . It's because Naisi killed him. Think of that and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor- ing, or the night you hear strange stories of the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster either.  Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.  He is welcome. Let you rest, Fergus, you should be hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.  It's a sunny nook you've found in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and Naisi back to Emain.  They've answered? They would go?  They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks; and to this day the old men have nothing so heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the lonesome mornings with birds crying on the bogs. Let you come this day, for there's no place but Ireland where the Gael can have peace always. It's true, surely. Yet we're better this place while Conchubor's in Emain Macha.  There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal. I am your surety with Conchubor. You'll not be young always, and it's time you were making yourselves ready for the years will come, building up a homely dun beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your children from the princes' wives. It's little joy wandering till age is on you and your youth is gone away, so you'd best come this night, for you'd have great pleasure putting out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland, surely."  It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.  Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if a timid woman could turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of kings. Let you be thinking on the years to come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice beside some king of Emain. Wouldn't it be a poor story if a queen the like of you should have no thought but to be scraping up her hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of kings?  I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well, Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake of your own years, so you'll not be saying till your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was scooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see a queen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what I'm saying. You'd do well to come back to men and women are your match and comrades, and not be lingering until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow up within your eyes. . . . You're here years and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN458	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$You stick to me, Brocky, and I'll pull you through.  Monsieur Fleury.  The chef.  Very charmed to see you, Monsieur Fleury.  Thank you very much.  Agatha--recitation!  Mr. Rolleston.  How do you do, Rolleston?  Mr. Tompsett.  Miss Fisher.  This is a pleasure, Miss Fisher.  If I might venture, Miss Fisher  Miss Simmons.  You are always welcome, Miss Simmons.  At last we meet. Won't you sit down?  Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Charmed to see you, Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Mr. Treherne, this is Fisher, my maid.  Your what, Mary?  My friend. Thomas.  How do you do, Thomas?  John.  How do you do, John?  Brocklehurst, this is John. I think you have already met on the door-step.  Jane.  Give me your hand, Jane.  Gladys.  How do you do, Gladys. You know my uncle?  Your hand, Gladys.  Tweeny.  So happy to see you.  John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce me.  That's an uncommon pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.  No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.  They are not all here, Crichton.  Odds and ends. Which is to recite?  And how are all at home?  Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?  No, no, the family. How's the baby?  Blooming, your lordship.  A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice little fellow.  Beg pardon, my lord, it's a girl.  A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.  Very delighted to see you, Crichton.  Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?  Milk and sugar, Crichton?  I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.  To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful. Oh, please do speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?  It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.  I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.  I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.  Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything?  I have no idea, my lady.  But you laughed.  My lady, he is the second son of a peer.  Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.
EN109	1	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with me.  And where is he now?  Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.  Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay for Mrs. O'Toole.  I can't drink any tay. I'm that injured I can't drink at all, at all.  A drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.  Yis, mum.  I was out in me cabbage garden picking a bit of cabbage for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water. And I'm almost killed entirely--and it's all the fault of your goat, Mrs. Mulligan.  There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things easy.  I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan. Sure I'm thinking I'll be after spindin' the rist of me life standing up on me two fate.  So the goat struck ye, did he?  He did.  My, my, the trouble I've had all along of that Shamus O'Brien. He's an awful goat, is Shamus O'Brien.   Here's the tea, mum.  Thank ye kindly, Bridget. Here, Kathleen, take a cup of tay and let it soothe your wounded feelings.  Sure, it's more than me feelings that is wounded, Mrs. Mulligan.  Maw, ain't it time we were starting for the entertainment?  My, my, I've been that excited about the misdeeds of that rascal Shamus O'Brien that I had forgotten the Christmas entertainment entirely.  Sure, your family looks as though they were going out in society, Mollie Mulligan.  hey are that. They're on their way to the fine church entertainment at the Sunday School down the strate.  Maw, here comes Matsy with the goat.  Matsy Mulligan, tie that goat in the back yard and tie all his four fate together. I'll tach him a lesson, if it's the last thing I ever do. Patsy, go out and help your brother tie up Shamus O'Brien.
EN108	0	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was courting each other just like the rest of yeez.  Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.  Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at him?  Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez are. Will you look at the red color in his face?  If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.  Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's a fine girl, if I do say it myself.  Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain to spake her piece.  LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.

Set aside the dull enigma, We shall guess it all too soon; Failure brings no kind of stigma-- Dance we to another tune!  String the lyre and fill the cup, Lest on sorrow we should sup.  Hop and skip to Fancy's fiddle, Hands across and down the middle-- Life's perhaps the only riddle That we shrink from giving up!    Bridegroom and bride! Knot that's insoluble, Voices all voluble Hail it with pride. Bridegroom and bride! We in sincerity Wish you prosperity, Bridegroom and bride! When a merry maiden marries, Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries; Every sound becomes a song, All is right, and nothing's wrong! From to-day and ever after Let our tears be tears of laughter. Every sigh that finds a vent Be a sigh of sweet content! When you marry, merry maiden, Then the air with love is laden; Every flower is a rose, Every goose becomes a swan, Every kind of trouble goes Where the last year's snows have gone! Sunlight takes the place of shade When you marry, merry maid!  When a merry maiden marries, Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries; Every sound becomes a song, All is right, and nothing's wrong. Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow, Get ye gone until to-morrow; Jealousies in grim array, Ye are things of yesterday! When you marry, merry maiden, Then the air with joy is laden; All the corners of the earth Ring with music sweetly played, Worry is melodious mirth, Grief is joy in masquerade;
EN405	1	Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  Well, I----  Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  Well, I----  If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  Neither do I.  Neither do I.  Neither do any of us.  I don't want to miss nothing neither.  No, und I don't neither.  Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  Well, what is Anita's secret.  She wouldn't tell me.  Oh!  She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret.  It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  Allee samee hang mine.  I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  I wonder what has become of Anita?  I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  So are all of us.  We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.

Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee Peter Pan.

EN421	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold.  Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.  God rest his soul.  Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.  The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.  I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.  Thank you kindly, lady of the house.  Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.  I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.  Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?  There's no offence, lady of the house?  No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all?
EN422	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is that I have cast a favourable eye.  As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit us.  My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.  Unfortunately, that is not what we want.  And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the ladies'-maids for our evening meals.  She dresses Fisher's hair?  Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.  Does!  Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.  What alters!  Which alters.  Mary?  I shall certainly have her.  We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make a lady's-maid of you.  Oh lawks!  We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of Crichton.  It will undoubtedly increase the young person's chances.  Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she will make the necessary arrangements.  My lady!  By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.  You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?  Certainly. But-- You ain't going, sir?  No.  Then neither ain't I.  YOU must.  Leave him! Not me.  Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your wages.  I ain't going.  I feared this, my lady.  Nothing'll budge me.  Leave the room.  Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with her.  I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.  The ingrate! The smug! The fop!  What is it now, father?  That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid.  Hurrah!  Darling father, rather than you should lose Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.  Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without three maids.  Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the usual perquisites.  Any one will do.  My lord!  The ingrate! The puppy!  I ask a favour of a servant?--never!  Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--  I beg your pardon.  But think of the joy to Tweeny.  Crichton, do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality?  My lord, I have found a man.  Already? Who is he?  Yourself?  Father, how good of him.  Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.  My lady--a valet's hand!  I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?  Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an answer.  My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that Thomas and John were equal to me.  But father says if we were to return to nature--
EN423	1	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.   I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite, If any wonders you have seen this night?  I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light  Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.  Tell me, for thou art native of this place, What dost thou know about the King of Grace-- King of the Jews?   Aye, in Jerusalem He dwells, and not in Bethlehem. He sits upon his mighty judgment throne, Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.   I mean a new-born King, of love and peace; His is the star--His reign shall never cease.   All things tonight seem passing strange to me, I have just read an ancient prophecy That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town, Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown, Of one called Councillor of King David's line Whose coming is foretold in words divine. And now you come with words of mystery! Why should thy questions, which are dark to me, Cause me to think of Him?   The star! The star! No more it moves about the heavens afar, It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray, For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!   His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within And seek protection in my humble inn.    Three kings came riding from far away, Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar; Three wise men out of the east were they, And they traveled by night and they slept by day, For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.   The star was so beautiful, large and clear, That all other stars of the sky Became a white mist in the atmosphere; And by this they knew that the coming was near Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.
EN424	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night.  You should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and Spain.  We were great surely, with wide and windy acres of rich Munster land.  Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?  Is it me?  Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?  I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in the naked parish where I grew a man.  If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking, and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.  I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't fearing you at all.  You've said the like of that, maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.  I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine prancing women making laughter with the men.  If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.  You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you single now?  What would I want wedding so young?  We're alike, so.
EN425	0	Gawd, I can't stand this! I better beat it.  Well, who's the blond?  Dat vas Anna, Larry.  Your daughter, Anna?  Don't you tank she vas pooty gel, Larry?  Sure! A peach!  You bet you! Give me drink for take back--one port vine for Anna--she calabrate dis one time with me--and small beer for me.  Small beer for you, eh? She's reformin' you already.  You bet! You look tired, Anna. Veil, Ay make you take good long rest now. Come, you drink vine. It put new life in you. Skoal, Anna! You know dat Svedish word?  Skoal! Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!       Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$I never married with one, let alone with a couple or three.  Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn. Were you off east, young fellow, fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the Boers?  I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week.  He's done nothing, so. If you didn't commit murder or a bad, nasty thing, or false coining, or robbery, or butchery, or the like of them, there isn't anything that would be worth your troubling for to run from now. You did nothing at all.  That's an unkindly thing to be saying to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging before, and hell's gap gaping below.  You're only saying it. You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the windpipe of a screeching sow.  You're not speaking the truth.  Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?  Don't strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the like of that.  Is it killed your father?  With the help of God I did surely, and that the Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.  There's a daring fellow.  Oh, glory be to God!  That was a hanging crime, mister honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.  He was a dirty man, God forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up with him at all.  And you shot him dead?  I never used weapons. I've no license, and I'm a law-fearing man.  It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world it's bloody knives they use.  Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?  You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers swearing it had life?
EN426	1	Naisi and his brothers are well pleased with this place; and what would take them back to Conchubor in Ulster?  Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing. I'm in dread Conchubor wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna. I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but those have a great love for yourself have a right to be in dread always.  Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi. And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the woods?  It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high throne of Ireland. . . . It's that would save you, surely.  There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and the things old men foretold.  Was there little power in what you did the night you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the big nobles did dread the blackness of your luck? It was power enough you had that night to bring distress and anguish; and now I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll not stir stick or straw to aid me.  Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham, if you have will itself to guard Naisi.  Naisi is it? I didn't care if the crows were stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day. It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and you waking up in a cold bed, without the man you have your heart on, I am raging now. Yet there is more men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would fill you up with dread.Let you end; such talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live after him. It's well you know it's this day I'm dreading seven years, and I fine nights watching the heifers walking to the haggard with long shadows on the grass; or the time I've been stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for a happy and sleepy queen?  And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi chooses?  I've dread going or staying, Lavarcham. It's lonesome this place, having happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day will this day match yesterday, and will to- morrow take a good place beside the same day in the year that's gone, and wondering all times is it a game worth playing, living on until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone for ever.  If it's that ails you, I tell you there's little hurt getting old, though young girls and poets do be storming at the shapes of age. There's little hurt getting old, saving when you're looking back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing the young you have a love for breaking up their hearts with folly. Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll come you'll have more joy having the senses of an old woman and you with your little grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have this night putting on the red mouth and the white arms you have, to go walking lonesome byways with a gamey king.  It's little joy of a young woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this day, surely. But what use is in our talking when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and Fergus with him?  I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the moon over to take a new path in the sky. You'll not stop him this day, and isn't it a strange story you were a plague and torment, since you were that height, to those did hang their lifetimes on your voice. Don't think bad of my crying. I'm not the like of many and I'd see a score of naked corpses and not heed them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself in your hour of joy when the end is coming surely.  Fergus's men are calling you. You were seen on the path, and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.  Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a morning is the like of this. Yet if you are a spy itself I'll go and give my word that's wanting surely.  So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.  I've heard news of Fergus; what brought you from Ulster?  The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my skull. Was there ever a man crossed nine waves after a fool's wife and he not away in his head?  It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's civility in speech with queens.  It's a long while, surely. It's three weeks I am losing my manners beside the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog. Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.$$$ï»¿ Good evening to you, lady of the house.  Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be out in the rain falling.  It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.  Is it walking on your feet, stranger?  On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all!  It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.  Is it departed he is?  It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for the winter.  It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.  He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.  Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is not tidied, or laid out itself?  I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.  It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.  He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.
EN427	1	I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.  You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.  Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.  I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.  She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such dastard words.  Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.  France will hack her way through her.  My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.  I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.  Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?  Bonaparte would have acted quickly.  Bonaparte!  The paper, Sire.  Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.  The least delay----  Overmuch reflection----  I wish to be alone.  Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte, coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four, to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_ I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?  A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany.  A friend--a consort! I would hear you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.  You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.  It was all done for you.  So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.  You would not have me sign?  I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long.  I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.  My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have many homes, and the fairest is in France.  If that were true, Germany would care less for you.  If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you say you fight for me. Find some other reason.  The jealousies of nations----  All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."  Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.$$$You stick to me, Brocky, and I'll pull you through.  Monsieur Fleury.  The chef.  Very charmed to see you, Monsieur Fleury.  Thank you very much.  Agatha--recitation!  Mr. Rolleston.  How do you do, Rolleston?  Mr. Tompsett.  Miss Fisher.  This is a pleasure, Miss Fisher.  If I might venture, Miss Fisher  Miss Simmons.  You are always welcome, Miss Simmons.  At last we meet. Won't you sit down?  Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Charmed to see you, Mademoiselle Jeanne.  Mr. Treherne, this is Fisher, my maid.  Your what, Mary?  My friend. Thomas.  How do you do, Thomas?  John.  How do you do, John?  Brocklehurst, this is John. I think you have already met on the door-step.  Jane.  Give me your hand, Jane.  Gladys.  How do you do, Gladys. You know my uncle?  Your hand, Gladys.  Tweeny.  So happy to see you.  John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce me.  That's an uncommon pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.  No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.  They are not all here, Crichton.  Odds and ends. Which is to recite?  And how are all at home?  Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?  No, no, the family. How's the baby?  Blooming, your lordship.  A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice little fellow.  Beg pardon, my lord, it's a girl.  A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.  Very delighted to see you, Crichton.  Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?  Milk and sugar, Crichton?  I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.  To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful. Oh, please do speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?  It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.  I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.  I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.  Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything?  I have no idea, my lady.  But you laughed.  My lady, he is the second son of a peer.  Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.
EN428	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$And now tell me, have you been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.  No, my lady; his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.  What's that? No equality? Can't you see, Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would be equal?  If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--  Go on.  The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.  It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense.  Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been striving to point out to your lordship.  What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking daggers.  The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.  How are you, Fisher?  I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at all.  Oh dear, who says so?  His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea.  But why not?  If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me--  So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?  No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.  Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the question.  No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.  For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.  But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under weigh.  Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this voyage have but one maid between them.  My lord!  My mind is made up.  I cordially agree.  And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of-- Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.  The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--  I have it now--(not he).  Crichton.  One maid among three grown women!  Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful kitchenmaid--  I can't blame you, George.  Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself, Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you, darling, before you sail.  Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?  One maid among three of us. What's to be done?  Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.  Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?  Are you aware that dresses button up the back?  How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage?  Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds?
EN429	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$Plenty of children there are in our city, Who have no fathers or mothers to pity; Plenty of people whose working and heeding Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing. Now, if I came every year in December, These are the ones I would surely remember.  Once on a beautiful Christmas you know Jesus our Saviour was born here below, Patiently stooping to hunger and pain, So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame; Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed All His poor brothers and sisters who need.  Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it, You would remember and certainly do it; This year, at least, when you empty your pack, Pray give a portion to all who may lack. Then, if there's anything left and you can Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.    Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!  She takes after her own mother. I was just like her when I was that age.  And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.  Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I think the show is about to begin. Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical! Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical! Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks! Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks! Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled, Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld, The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man, Aerial Artists from far-off Japan, Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun, Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!  Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old, to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcel post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife.

Well, when I made up my mind to come to see you, I thought you was a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I could visit a while and rest up--till I felt able to get back on the job again.  But Ay gat place, Anna--nice place. You rest all you want, py yiminy! You don't never have to vork as nurse gel no more. You stay with me, py golly!  Then you're really glad to see me--honest?

'If you would like to take Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the garden.'  'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'  'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'  'But there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'  'Let me, dear,'  'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'  'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is. There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew, he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go to the alder pool, Barbara.'  'We won't go there, dear.'  'Did I do all right, Ellen?'  'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'  'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion! I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'  'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to you; you like that, don't you?'  'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No, I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'  'Barbara?'  'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'  'Which bit shall I read?'  'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.' 'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun to laugh already.'  'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'  'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish? Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'  'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'  'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'  'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but something prevents him.'  'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'  'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better. Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'  'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little light?'  'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it helps one to concentrate.'   'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you still there?'  'I think I felt a movement.'  'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'  'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'  'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'  'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'  'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'  'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with A?--with B? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the fourth word Welcome? Yes.'  'Love Bade Me Welcome.'
EN212	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$Come along with me now, lady of the house, and it's not my blather you'll be hearing only, but you'll be hearing the herons crying out over the black lakes, and you'll be hearing the grouse and the owls with them, and the larks and the big thrushes when the days are warm, and it's not from the like of them you'll be hearing a talk of getting old like Peggy Cavanagh, and losing the hair off you, and the light of your eyes, but it's fine songs you'll be hearing when the sun goes up, and there'll be no old fellow wheezing, the like of a sick sheep, close to your ear.  I'm thinking it's myself will be wheezing that time with lying down under the Heavens when the night is cold; but you've a fine bit of talk, stranger, and it's with yourself I'll go.  You think it's a grand thing you're after doing with your letting on to be dead, but what is it at all? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this place, and she not making a talk with the men passing? And what way will yourself live from this day, with none to care for you? What is it you'll have now but a black life, Daniel Burke, and it's not long I'm telling you, till you'll be lying again under that sheet, and you dead surely.  Sit down now and take a little taste of the stuff, Micheal Dara. There's a great drouth on me, and the night is young.  And it's very dry I am, surely, with the fear of death you put on me, and I after driving mountain ewes since the turn of the day.  I was thinking to strike you, Micheal Dara, but you're a quiet man, God help you, and I don't mind you at all.  Your good health, Micheal Dara.  God reward you, Daniel Burke, and may you have a long life, and a quiet life, and good health with it.

And vhen deir boys grows up, go to sea, dey sit and vait some more. Any gel marry sailor, she's crazy fool! Your mo'der she tal you same tang if she vas alive.  Funny! I do feel sort of--nutty, to-night. I feel old.  Old?  Sure--like I'd been living a long, long time--out here in the fog. I don't know how to tell you yust what I mean. It's like I'd come home after a long visit away some place. It all seems like I'd been here before lots of times--on boats--in this same fog. You must think I'm off my base.  Anybody feel funny dat vay in fog.  But why d'you s'pose I feel so--so--like I'd found something I'd missed and been looking for--'s if this was the right place for me to fit in? And I seem to have forgot--everything that's happened--like it didn't matter no more. And I feel clean, somehow--like you feel yust after you've took a bath. And I feel happy for once--yes, honest!--happier than I ever been anywhere before! It's nutty for me to feel that way, don't you think?  Ay tank Ay'm damn fool for bring you on voyage, Anna.  You talk--nutty to-night yourself. You act's if you was scared something was going to happen.  CHRIS--Only God know dat, Anna.  Then it'll be Gawd's will, like the preachers say-what does happen.  No! Dat ole davil, sea, she ain't God! "Ahoy!"  What's that?  Py golly, dat scare me for minute. It's only some fallar hail, Anna--loose his course in fog. Must be fisherman's power boat.

Dey been five days in open boat--four fallars--only one left able stand up. Come, Anna. Go gat oder fallar, Yohnson.  Yes, sir.  Row, ye divil! Row! What's this tub? Well, we're safe anyway--with the help of God. Is it losing the small wits ye iver had, ye are? Deck-scrubbing scut! I'm bate out--bate out entirely.  Here you are. Here's a drink for you. You need it, I guess.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'

It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$I never married with one, let alone with a couple or three.  Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn. Were you off east, young fellow, fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the Boers?  I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week.  He's done nothing, so. If you didn't commit murder or a bad, nasty thing, or false coining, or robbery, or butchery, or the like of them, there isn't anything that would be worth your troubling for to run from now. You did nothing at all.  That's an unkindly thing to be saying to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging before, and hell's gap gaping below.  You're only saying it. You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the windpipe of a screeching sow.  You're not speaking the truth.  Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?  Don't strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the like of that.  Is it killed your father?  With the help of God I did surely, and that the Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.  There's a daring fellow.  Oh, glory be to God!  That was a hanging crime, mister honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.  He was a dirty man, God forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up with him at all.  And you shot him dead?  I never used weapons. I've no license, and I'm a law-fearing man.  It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world it's bloody knives they use.  Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?  You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers swearing it had life?
EN216	0	Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  You can keep a secret, can't you?  Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  Yes. But how did you know?  Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  Well, I just guessed it.  Then why don't you guess how old I am?  Cute, ain't you?  Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  Cross my heart.  Listen, then; here's the secret.  He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  Yes, he is.  Honest?  Honest injun!  With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  Tonight?  Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  Fly.  Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?  Really and truly wings.  I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  He only bought them this year.  Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?  Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.  I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  You ought to see the work I've done today.  Here on the boat?$$$The tide, Crichton, is a postman who calls at our island twice a day for letters.  Thank you, sir.  Poor Crichton! I sometimes think he is losing his sense of humour. Come along, Agatha.  How horribly still it is.  It is best when it is still.  Mary, I have heard that they are always very still just before they jump.  Don't.  It is only Crichton knocking down trees.  Mary, let us go and stand beside him.  Let a servant see that I am afraid!  Don't, then; but remember this, dear, they often drop on one from above.  Crichton, Crichton!  Did you call, my lady?  I! Why should I?  I made a mistake, your ladyship. If you are afraid of being alone, my lady--  Afraid! Certainly not. You may go.  I wish, Crichton, you could work without getting so hot.  I wish I could, my lady.  It makes me hot to look at you.  It almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship.  Anything I can do for you in that way, Crichton, I shall do with pleasure.  Thank you, my lady.  Don't give way, my lady, things might be worse.  My poor father.  If I could have given my life for his.  You did all a man could do. Indeed I thank you, Crichton. You are a man.  Thank you, my lady.  But it is all so awful. Crichton, is there any hope of a ship coming?  Of course there is, my lady.  Don't treat me as a child. I have got to know the worst, and to face it. Crichton, the truth.  We were driven out of our course, my lady; I fear far from the track of commerce.  Thank you; I understand.  You're a good pluckt 'un, my lady.  I shall try to be. Crichton, how dare you?  I beg your ladyship's pardon; but you are.  And until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for you ladies.  Mr. Ernest does no work.  But he will, my lady.  I doubt it.  No work--no dinner--will make a great change in Mr. Ernest.  No work--no dinner. When did you invent that rule, Crichton?  I didn't invent it, my lady. I seem to see it growing all over the island.  Crichton, your manner strikes me as curious.  I hope not, your ladyship.  You are not implying anything so unnatural, I presume, as that if I and my sisters don't work there will be no dinner for us?  If it is unnatural, my lady, that is the end of it.  If? Now I understand. The perfect servant at home holds that we are all equal now. I see.  My lady, can you think me so inconsistent?  That is it.  My lady, I disbelieved in equality at home because it was against nature, and for that same reason I as utterly disbelieve in it on an island.  I apologise.  There must always, my lady, be one to command and others to obey.  One to command, others to obey. Yes. Crichton!  What is it, my lady?  Look what I found.  Cocoa-nuts. Bravo!  They grows on trees.  Where did you think they grew?  I thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks.
EN215	0	Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.  I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!  I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.  Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.  I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.  Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. I won't stand it--I can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.  It's the ice and the cold and the silence--they'd make any one look strange.  In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.  But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.$$$'You don't show it.'  'That is because of our awkward relationship.'  'We have got to go through with it.'  'There's no way out.'  'No.'  'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'  'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'  'There is a war on, Roger.'  'That needn't make any difference.'  'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of you, my boy.'  'Father, if any one were to hear you!'  'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return, Roger?'  'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'  'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'  'I--I forget.'  'Come on, Roger.'  'Is this fair, father?'  'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'  'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'  'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm glad you tell her everything.'  'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'  'Aren't there, Roger!'  'Best not to tell her.'  'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or anything?'  'No thanks,' 'Any little debts, for instance?'  'That's all right now. Mother--'  'She did?'  'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'  'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'  'How did you know?'  'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'  'No.'  'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''  'Good lord, father!'  'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all different now.'  'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'  'No! Not about yourself?'  'No. At least--'  'Just as you like, Roger.'  'It blew over long ago.'  'Then there's no need?'  'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'  'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'  'Not now. She--you know what women are.'  'Yes, yes.'  'You needn't mention it to mother.'  'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'  'I never--of course you are not young.'  'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it till quite lately.'  'That you're old?' 'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'  'What made you know?'  'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.'  'You!'  'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you, I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and tried to run a mile.'  'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'  'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up. The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'  'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share, taking care of mother and Emma.'  'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head of the house now.'  'Father!'  'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is the head of it.'  'Me? Fudge.'  'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger, though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog, is being damned daily on parade.'  'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'  'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'  'Shut up, father!'  'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon, confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'
EN214	1	I'll do it, Annie--for your sake--if you say it's needful for ye.  God bless you for that, David!  The ice is breakin' up to no'the'ard, sir. There's a clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond, the lookout says.  A clear passage? To no'the'ard?  Yes, sir.  Then get her ready and we'll drive her through.  Aye, aye, sir.  David! David!  Will the men turn to willin' or must we drag 'em out?  They'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God into 'em, sir. They're meek as lambs.  KEENEY. Then drive 'em--both watches. [_With grim determination._] They's whale t'other side o' this floe and we're agoin' to git 'em.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir.  And I was agoin' home like a yaller dog!  David!  Woman, you ain't adoin' right when you meddle in men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I got to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in. I got to git the ile, I tell ye. David! Aren't you going home?  You ain't well. Go and lay down a mite. I got to git on deck.  David!  Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? Annie! What is it? Don't you know me, Annie?  You said--you was agoin' mad--God!  Whales, sir--a whole school of 'em--off the star-b'd quarter 'bout five miles away--big ones!  Are you lowerin' the boats?  MATE. Yes, sir.  I'm acomin' with ye.  MATE. Aye, aye, sir. You'll git the ile now right enough, sir.  Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git the ile. [I know you're foolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind--be you? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while longer, Annie--then we'll turn home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?  All ready, sir.  Comin', sir?$$$No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all the same mopin' and lazin' in it. It's the bad luck I've been havin' altogether this last year since your mother died. Who's to do the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. hat a fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a millionaire! Mary, dear, it's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most. What are you sniffin' at?  I was thinking--of Mamma.  It's late you are with your tears, and her cold in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!  Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself?  Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I beat him.  Slow poke!  You didn't beat me, neither!  I did, too!  You did not! You didn't play fair. You tripped me comin' up the steps. Brick-top! Cheater!  You're a liar! You stumbled over your own big feet, clumsy bones! And I beat you fair Didn't I, Papa?  You did, darlin', and fair, too. Sure it's you can beat the divil himself!  See? Liar!  Did you get the plug for me I told you?
EN352	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."

It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.  Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?  It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your wages soon, I'll be bound.  Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.  Five dollars a week--for a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted, thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
EN219	0	Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  Oh, show me.  I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  It isn't anything scary, is it?  Of course not. There; what do you think of that?  Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  Of course he is. That is our secret.  Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  What are you going to do when you get to America?  I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  Take the monkey's place?  Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way and say, "Give-a de monk de cent!"  Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.$$$'Not I.'  'Young gentlemen, how disgraceful!'  'Harum-scarums!'  'Does he know about you two?'  'He often forgets, I'll tell him again. Grandfather, Barbara and I have something to say to you. It's this.'  'I know--I know. There's nothing like it. I'm very glad, Barbara.'  'You see, dear, I've loved Billy boy since the days when he tried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I held on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at school at marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroom had always to take the name of Billy. "Do you, woman, take this man Billy--" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answer diffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, "I should rather think she does."'  'Don't forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldn't find the ring!'  'Were you married here, sir?'  'Yes, at the village church.'  'So were my father and mother.'  'I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some of the furniture.'  'I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?'  'No, just the same.'  'I hoped you would say that.'  'But, Billy, I'm to have such a dream of a wedding gown. Granny is going with me to London, to choose it'--laying her head on the Colonel's shoulder--'if you can do without her for a day, dear.'  'I shall go with you, I couldn't trust you and granny to choose the gown.'  'You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out and about enjoying ourselves.'  'They all say that. But that is the time when I'm not lonely, Karl. It's then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It all comes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and it's so real, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to see them; I don't know they haven't been here, Billy, till your granny tells me afterwards.' 'Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.'  'It isn't often she leaves you for so long, dear.'  'She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes, she has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'A wedding?'  'It's curious how he harps on that.'  'She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.'  'Not to-day, dear.'  'Best not to worry him.'  'But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.'  'Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?'  'You were there, Barbara.'  'No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.'  'She was there, too.'  'Any one else?'  'There was that soldier.'  'A soldier also!'  'Just those three.'  'But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.'  'They were all there; but there were only three.'  'Odd.'  'Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right. She is the one for you.'  'She is the one for me.'  'If there had been a wedding, wouldn't she have taken the Colonel with her?'  'Of course she would.'  'You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.'  'Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, very likely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on their wedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are all pretty on their wedding day.' 'You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!'  'Yes, I have; yes, I have!'  'I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to you about Billy boy and me, and you haven't been able to wait; you have hurried on the wedding!'  'Bravo, Barbara, you've got it.'  'That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.'  'Our wedding, Billy!'  'It doesn't explain those other people, though.'  'What is it, dear?'  'I can't quite remember, but I think that is why she didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy is to be there, my love.'  'Not at my wedding!'  'Grandfather!'  'There's something sad about it.'  'There can't be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Granny didn't say it was a sad wedding, did she?'  'She was smiling.'  'Of course she was.'  'But I think that was only to please the nurse.'  'That nurse again! Dear, don't think any more about it. There's no wedding.'  'Is there not?'  'I told you! There is a wedding!'  'It's Barbara's wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbara's wedding?'

You didn't even take your meals with the family?  No, my lady, I dined apart.  You, girl, also? Did you dine with Crichton?  No, your ladyship.  With whom?  I took my bit of supper with--with Daddy and Polly and the rest.  Dear old Daddy--he was our monkey. You remember our monkey, Agatha?  Rather! What a funny old darling he was.  And don't you think Polly was the sweetest little parrot, Mary?  Ah! I understand; animals you had domesticated?  Quite so--quite so.  The servants' teas that used to take place here once a month--  They did not seem natural on the island, my lady, and were discontinued by the Gov.'s orders.  A clear proof, Loam, that they were a mistake here.  I admit it frankly. I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I think of going over to the Tories.  I am delighted to hear it.  Thank you, Crichton, thank you; that is all.  One moment. Young people, Crichton, will be young people, even on an island; now, I suppose there was a certain amount of--shall we say sentimentalising, going on? Yes, my lady, there was.  Mother!  Which gentleman? You, girl, tell me.  If you please, my lady--  The fact is--  It was him--Mr. Ernest, your ladyship.  With which lady?  I have already told you, Lady Brocklehurst, that Ernest and I--  Yes, now; but you were two years on the island. Was it this lady?  No, your ladyship.  Then I don't care which of the others it was. Well, I suppose that will do.  Do! I hope you are ashamed of yourself, mother. You are an excellent fellow, Crichton; and if, after we are married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.  Oh no, impossible--  Why impossible? Do you see why it should be impossible, my man?  Yes, my lady. I had not told you, my lord, but as soon as your lordship is suited I wish to leave service.  What will you do, Crichton?  Shall I withdraw, my lord?  Horrid of me, wasn't it? But if one wasn't disagreeable now and again, it would be horribly tedious to be an old woman. He will soon be yours, Mary, and then--think of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to me. On that understanding, my dear, don't you think we might--?  Quite so--quite so. To wish you every dear happiness.  The same to you, my lady.  Do you despise me, Crichton? You are the best man among us.  On an island, my lady, perhaps; but in England, no.  Then there's something wrong with England.  My lady, not even from you can I listen to a word against England.  Tell me one thing: you have not lost your courage?  No, my lady.

Act II   SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside. The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the silence at regular intervals.  As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an Anna! Anna!  Yes, here I am. What d'you want?  Don't you come turn in, Anna? It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in fog, Ay tank.  Why not? I love this fog! Honest! It's so----Funny and still. I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.  Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py yingo!  Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting so's I love it, the little I've seen.  Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm glad it makes you feel good again. You like live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?  Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man. I don't wonder you always been a sailor.  Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.  I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.  You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you to sleep.  I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about things.  CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act funny to-night, Anna.  Say, what're you trying to do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here.$$$I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was courting each other just like the rest of yeez.  Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.  Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at him?  Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez are. Will you look at the red color in his face?  If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.  Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's a fine girl, if I do say it myself.  Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain to spake her piece.  LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.  Blessed old Santa Claus, king of delights, What are you doing these long winter nights? Filling your budgets with trinkets and toys, Wonderful gifts for the girls and the boys. While you are planning for everything nice, Pray let me give you a bit of advice.  Don't take it hard if I say in your ear, Santa, I thought you were partial last year; Loading the rich folks with everything gay, Snubbing the poor ones who came in your way.

EN354	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$'That's better,'  'I think I'll go to my room now. You will come up, mater?'  'Yes, dear. I shan't be five minutes, John.'  'More like half an hour.'  'There is nothing wrong, is there? I thought I noticed a--a----'  'A certain liveliness, my dear. No, we were only having a good talk.'  'What about, John?'  'About the war,'  'About tactics and strategy, wasn't it, Roger?'  'Yes.'  'The fact is, Ellen, I have been helping Roger to take his first trench.' With a big breath, 'And we took it too, together, didn't we, Roger?'  'You bet,'  'Though I suppose,' sighing, 'it is one of those trenches that the enemy retake during the night.'  'Oh, I--I don't know, father.'  'Whatever are you two talking about?'  'Aha, it is very private. We don't tell you everything, you know, Ellen.'  'Come on, mater, it's only his beastly sarcasm again. 'Night, father; I won't see you in the morning.'  ''Night,'  'Good-night, dear father.'  'A beautiful morning, Dering.'  'Too much sun, sir. The roses be complaining, and, to make matters worse, Miss Barbara has been watering of them--in the heat of the day.'  'Has she? She means well. Dering, you heard it, didn't you?'  'What was that, sir?'  'The thunderstorm--early this morning.'  'There was no thunderstorm, sir.'  'That is what they all say. It was at four o'clock. I got up and looked out at the window. The evening primroses were very beautiful.'  'I don't hold much with evening primroses, sir; but I was out and about at four; there was no thunderstorm.'  'I suppose I just thought there was one. Perhaps it was some thunderstorm of long ago that I heard. They do come back, you know.'  'Do they, sir?'  'I am glad to see you moving about in the garden, Dering, with everything just as usual.'  'Thank you, sir.'  'No, don't go. I am--a little troubled, Dering.'  'Everything be all right, sir.'  'I'm glad of that,' the Colonel says with relief. 'It is pleasant to see that you have come back, Dering. Why did you go away for such a long time?'  'Me, sir?' Dering is a little aggrieved. 'I haven't had a day off since Christmas.'  'Haven't you? I thought--'  'Is everything just as usual, Dering?'  'Yes, sir. There never were a place less changed than this.'  'That's true.' The Colonel is appeased. 'Thank you, Dering, for saying that.' But next moment he has lowered his voice again. 'Dering, there is nothing wrong, is there? Is anything happening that I am not being told about?'  'Not that I know of, sir.'  'That is what they all say, but--I don't know. Dering, I feel as if I was needed somewhere. I don't know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is every one?'  'They're all about, sir. There's a cricket match on at the village green.'  'Is there?'  'If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices. You were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.'  'Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggest score I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred, but I wouldn't let them. I was pretty good at steering them through the slips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didn't matter where point stood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.'  'That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snap you regular at point.'  'Did he? I daresay he did. I can't play now, but I like to watch it still.' 'Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I don't understand it, Dering. When I got there the green was all dotted with them--it's the prettiest sight and sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, one and two at a time; they weren't given out, you know, they went as if they had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--and then they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps were left lying about. Why is it?'  'It's just fancy, sir, I saw Master Will oiling his bat yesterday.'
EN355	0	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.  Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her, but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.  How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags." That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take.  A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an infamous proposal.  The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know them, Sire. Your signature?  I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.  There are a hundred gates to open that way.  My guns shall open them.  You can think of no easier road, Sire?  I think of it night and day.  One further north--through Belgium?  If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.  On the contrary, Sire----  Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor, by my plighted word.  Yet, Sire----  No, no! I will not so stain my name.$$$I knew rightly. And I was thinking, and I coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass.  I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. It's other things than the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.  It is surely, God help us all!  You're saying that, stranger, as if you were easy afeard.  Is it myself, lady of the house, that does be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have mercy on him--in the year that's gone.  You knew Darcy?  Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?  There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?  It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist, I'm destroyed surely."

It's later, surely, and I hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his brothers, are above chasing hares for two days or three, and the same awhile since when the moon was full.  The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself, it wasn't my wish brought them or could send them away.  If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her, and she turning a woman that was meant to be a queen.  Who'd check her like was meant to have her pleasure only, the way if there were no warnings told about her you'd see troubles coming when an old king is taking her, and she without a thought but for her beauty and to be straying the hills.  The gods help the lot of us. . . . Shouldn't she be well pleased getting the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled in his years itself? I don't know what he wanted putting her this wild place to be breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast- ing her supper and she with no patience for her food at all.  Is she coming from the glen? She is not. But whisht -- there's two men leaving the furze -- it's Conchubor and Fergus along with him. Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this night and herself abroad.  Are they close by?  Crossing the stream, and there's herself on the hillside with a load of twigs. Will I run out and put her in order before they'll set eyes on her at all?  You will not.

Where is Deirdre?  trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh. She does be all times straying around picking flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long as she's gathering new life I've a right not to heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will. A night with thunder coming is no night to be abroad.  She's used to every track and pathway, and the lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to singe the beauty of her like.

The mats and hangings are in this press, Conchubor. She wouldn't wish to be soiling them, she said, running out and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and it raining since the night of Samhain.

If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise to marry a big king and she a score only. Let you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll get little good seeing her this night, for with all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.$$$'I'll try not to,'  'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong about me.'  'You're all right.'  'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were to turn out to be a funk!'  'Father, how did you know?'  'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so as to help you.'  'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'  'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement.'  'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'  'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the trenches.'  'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'  'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'  'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'  'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for you more openly.'  'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'  'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'  'That's the ticket, father.'  'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'  'I suppose it would.'  'Well, what do you say?'  'I know she would like it.'  'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'  'Lord, yes!'  'But to gratify her.'  'I should be so conscious.'  'So should I.'  'How far would you go?'  'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in that.'  'It all depends on the way one says these things.'  'I should be quite casual.'  'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'  'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother would beam if you called me "dear father"'  'I don't think so?'  'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'  'It's so effeminate.'  'Not if you say it casually.'  'How does one say a thing like that casually?'  'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of that sort.'  'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do anything.'  'How do you mean?'  'You wouldn't paw me?'  'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when," he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?' 'They were French.'  'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'  'Why do you tell it to me?'  'Because it's a good story.'  'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father, that is barred.'  'What is barred?'  'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'  'Really, father--'  'Hold your tongue.'  'I must say, father--'  'Be quiet, I tell you.'  'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'  'My fault,'  'But whatever is the matter?'  'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'  'Why the dickens should I?'  'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'  'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'  'Do you like my joke, father?'  'Roger, you scoundrel!'
EN050	1	Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.  All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged.  I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?  France invades little Belgium.  Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down. Beware of Belgium!  Your Imperial Majesty has signed?  Thus  Sire!  Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.  But, Sire----  You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.  You were the friend of Austria.  I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.  Nay, Sire----  And so, there will be no war.  Sire, we beg----  These are my commands.  The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!  Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you. You! You have come here to mock me!  Oh, no.  I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was before the war.  It was you who made the war, O Emperor!  Belgium?  There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.  I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.  It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.  In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.  She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo, with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.  France, Russia?  They are here around your walls.  My people?  I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.  Do they curse me?  None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done your bidding.  The women curse me?  Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their Father and could do no wrong.  And you?  I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you farewell.  God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.  If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.$$$How is his lordship now?  A little easier, sir.  Crichton, send Fisher to me.  I have no pity for you girls, I--  Ernest, go away, and don't insult the broken-hearted.  And uncommon glad I am to go. Ta-ta, all of you. He asked me to say a few words. I came here to say a few words, and I'm not at all sure that I couldn't bring an action against him.  My poor sisters, come here. We must make this draw us closer together. I shall do my best to help you in every way. Just now I cannot think of myself at all.  But how unlike you, Mary.  It is my duty to protect my sisters.  I never knew her so sweet before, Agatha. (Cautiously.) What do you propose to do, Mary?  I propose when we are on the yacht to lend Fisher to you when I don't need her myself.  Fisher?  Of course, as the eldest, I have decided that it is my maid we shall take with us.  Mary, you toad.  Nothing on earth would induce Fisher to lift her hand for either me or Catherine.  I was afraid of it, Agatha. That is why I am so sorry for you.  Fisher, you heard what his lordship said?  Yes, my lady.  You have given me some satisfaction of late, Fisher, and to mark my approval I have decided that you shall be the maid who accompanies us.  I thank you, my lady.  That is all; you may go.  If you please, my lady, I wish to give notice.  Oh, certainly--you may go.  But why, Fisher?  I could not undertake, my lady, to wait upon three. We don't do it. Oh, my lady, to think that this affront--  I thought I told you to go, Fisher.  Serves you right.  It will be Simmons after all. Send Simmons to me.  My lady, might I venture to speak?  What is it?  I happen to know, your ladyship, that Simmons desires to give notice for the same reason as Fisher.  Oh!  Then, Catherine, we take Jeanne.  And Jeanne also, my lady.  We can't blame them. Could any maid who respected herself be got to wait upon three?  I suppose there are such persons, Crichton?  I have heard, my lady, that there are such.  Crichton, what's to be done? We sail in two days; could one be discovered in the time?  Surely you can think of some one?  There is in this establishment, your ladyship, a young woman--  Yes?  A young woman, on whom I have for some time cast an eye.  Do you mean as a possible lady's-maid?  I had thought of her, my lady, in another connection.  Ah!  But I believe she is quite the young person you require. Perhaps if you could see her, my lady--  I shall certainly see her. Bring her to me. You two needn't wait.  Needn't we? We see your little game, Mary.  We shall certainly remain and have our two-thirds of her.  This, my lady, is the young person.  Oh dear!  Come here, girl. Don't be afraid.  Her appearance, my lady, is homely, and her manners, as you may have observed, deplorable, but she has a heart of gold.  What is your position downstairs?  I'm a tweeny, your ladyship.  A what?  A tweeny; that is to say, my lady, she is not at present, strictly speaking, anything; a between maid; she helps the vegetable maid. It is she, my lady, who conveys the dishes from the one end of the kitchen table, where they are placed by the cook, to the other end, where they enter into the charge of Thomas and John.  I see. And you and Crichton are--ah--keeping company?  A butler don't keep company, my lady.  Does he not?  No, your ladyship, we butlers may--(he makes a gesture with his arms)--but we do not keep company.  I know what it is; you are engaged?
EN059	1	Sire----  Is that the paper?  It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.  When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.  At last, this little paper----  Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----  Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany, when I have signed! And yet----  Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?  Afraid!  Oh, Sire!  I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."  That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword must speak.  There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.  For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire, your signature!  What of Britain?  This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk, draws near!  The Day! To The Day! But when?  Now, if she wants it!  There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued. Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain. Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in just now.  If I was sure of that!  I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers.  These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It is a land that in the past has done things.  In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies Britain's greatness.

'Young gentlemen, how disgraceful!'  'Harum-scarums!'  'Does he know about you two?'  'He often forgets, I'll tell him again. Grandfather, Barbara and I have something to say to you. It's this.'  'I know--I know. There's nothing like it. I'm very glad, Barbara.'  'You see, dear, I've loved Billy boy since the days when he tried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I held on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at school at marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroom had always to take the name of Billy. "Do you, woman, take this man Billy--" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answer diffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, "I should rather think she does."'  'Don't forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldn't find the ring!'  'Were you married here, sir?'  'Yes, at the village church.'  'So were my father and mother.'  'I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some of the furniture.'  'I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?'  'No, just the same.'  'I hoped you would say that.'  'But, Billy, I'm to have such a dream of a wedding gown. Granny is going with me to London, to choose it'--laying her head on the Colonel's shoulder--'if you can do without her for a day, dear.'  'I shall go with you, I couldn't trust you and granny to choose the gown.'  'You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out and about enjoying ourselves.'  'They all say that. But that is the time when I'm not lonely, Karl. It's then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It all comes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and it's so real, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to see them; I don't know they haven't been here, Billy, till your granny tells me afterwards.' 'Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.'  'It isn't often she leaves you for so long, dear.'  'She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes, she has gone down to the village to a wedding.'  'A wedding?'  'It's curious how he harps on that.'  'She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.'  'Not to-day, dear.'  'Best not to worry him.'  'But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.'  'Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?'  'You were there, Barbara.'  'No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.'  'She was there, too.'  'Any one else?'  'There was that soldier.'  'A soldier also!'  'Just those three.'  'But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.'  'They were all there; but there were only three.'  'Odd.'  'Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right. She is the one for you.'  'She is the one for me.'  'If there had been a wedding, wouldn't she have taken the Colonel with her?'  'Of course she would.'  'You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.'  'Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, very likely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on their wedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are all pretty on their wedding day.' 'You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!'  'Yes, I have; yes, I have!'  'I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to you about Billy boy and me, and you haven't been able to wait; you have hurried on the wedding!'  'Bravo, Barbara, you've got it.'  'That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.'  'Our wedding, Billy!'  'It doesn't explain those other people, though.'  'What is it, dear?'  'I can't quite remember, but I think that is why she didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy is to be there, my love.'  'Not at my wedding!'  'Grandfather!'  'There's something sad about it.'  'There can't be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Granny didn't say it was a sad wedding, did she?'  'She was smiling.'  'Of course she was.'  'But I think that was only to please the nurse.'  'That nurse again! Dear, don't think any more about it. There's no wedding.'  'Is there not?'  'I told you! There is a wedding!'  'It's Barbara's wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbara's wedding?'
EN058	0	you walking into my big, empty halls. I've made all sure to have you, and yet all said there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss you and have great troubles in the end. It's for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll come quickly; and you may take the word of a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any other, the like of what I'm bringing you in wildness and confusion in my own mind.  I cannot go, Conchubor.  It is my pleasure to have you, and I a man is waiting a long while on the throne of Ulster. Wouldn't you liefer be my com- rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve, than to be in this place and you a child always?  You don't know me and you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor. . . . I'm a long while watching the days getting a great speed passing me by. I'm too long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be living always.  Call Fergus to come with me. This is your last night upon Slieve Fuadh.  Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor. Isn't it a poor thing I should be hastened away, when all these troubles are foretold? Leave me a year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.  It's much to have me two score and two weeks waiting for your voice in Emain, and you in this place growing lonesome and shy. I'm a ripe man and in great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and we'll make Emain ready in the morning.  Do not call him, Conchubor. . . . Promise me a year of quiet. . . . It's one year I'm asking only.  You'd be asking a year next year, and the years that follow. Fergus! Fergus! Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers that must say the word. Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our people when the night is young.  The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late already, and it's no work the High King to be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path- ways when the floods are rising with the rain.  glad that he has made his decision -- Keep your rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.  Your rules are kept always.  The gods shield you.  Wasn't I saying you'd do it? You've brought your marriage a sight nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.  It wasn't I did it. Will you take me from this place, Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?  He'd have us tracked in the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen in spite of you, and I and mine would be destroyed for ever.  Are there none can go against Conchubor?  Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.  Would Fergus go against him?  He would, maybe, and his temper roused. Would Naisi and his brothers?  Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . . In the end of all there is none can go against Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking, for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.  Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham? Will the night be stormy in the hills?  looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've seen these years gone by.  Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the tables for our feet, and take out the skillets of silver, and the golden cups we have, and our two flasks of wine.  What ails you?  Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call dawdling this night. Lay them out quickly; I'm going into the room to put on the rich dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.  Putting on dresses at this hour, and it dark and drenching with the weight of rain! Are you away in your head?  I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in her house in Connaught. If Conchubor'll make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen who is a master, taking her own choice and making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . . Lay out your mats and hangings where I can stand this night and look about me. Lay out the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the goats of the west. I will not be a child or plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the richest, for I will not be brought down to Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing on the heath.$$$Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with me.  And where is he now?  Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.  Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay for Mrs. O'Toole.  I can't drink any tay. I'm that injured I can't drink at all, at all.  A drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.  Yis, mum.  I was out in me cabbage garden picking a bit of cabbage for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water. And I'm almost killed entirely--and it's all the fault of your goat, Mrs. Mulligan.  There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things easy.  I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan. Sure I'm thinking I'll be after spindin' the rist of me life standing up on me two fate.  So the goat struck ye, did he?  He did.  My, my, the trouble I've had all along of that Shamus O'Brien. He's an awful goat, is Shamus O'Brien.   Here's the tea, mum.  Thank ye kindly, Bridget. Here, Kathleen, take a cup of tay and let it soothe your wounded feelings.  Sure, it's more than me feelings that is wounded, Mrs. Mulligan.  Maw, ain't it time we were starting for the entertainment?  My, my, I've been that excited about the misdeeds of that rascal Shamus O'Brien that I had forgotten the Christmas entertainment entirely.  Sure, your family looks as though they were going out in society, Mollie Mulligan.  hey are that. They're on their way to the fine church entertainment at the Sunday School down the strate.  Maw, here comes Matsy with the goat.  Matsy Mulligan, tie that goat in the back yard and tie all his four fate together. I'll tach him a lesson, if it's the last thing I ever do. Patsy, go out and help your brother tie up Shamus O'Brien.
EN349	0	I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past when I've been throwing a line for salmon or watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice, and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.  I knew it, Naisi. . . . And take my word, Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no peace from this out in the woods.  She's not seen it. . . . Deirdre's no thought of getting old or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days, and she with spirits would keep bravery and laughter in a town with plague.  That humour'll leave her. But we've no call going too far, with one word borrowing another. Will you come this night to Emain Macha?  I'll not go, Fergus. I've had dreams of getting old and weary, and losing my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were dreams only. What are Conchubor's seals and all your talk of Emain and the fools of Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain? We'll stay this place till our lives and time are worn out. It's that word you may take in your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.  And you won't go, surely.  I will not. . . . I've had dread, I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the autumn and the springtime, even when there's a bird in every bush making his own stir till the fall of night; but this talk's brought me ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on the young trees, and we'll be so ever and always, though we'd live the age of the eagle and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers? My message is for them also.  You'll see them above chasing otters by the stream.  It isn't much I was mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.  You've heard my words to Fergus? Leave troubling, and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh, where the salmon will be running with the tide.  With the tide in a little while we will be journeying again, or it is our own blood maybe will be running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the winter and the summer pass quickly, and what way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?  We'll have the joy is highest till our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of great deeds could take us back to Emain.  It isn't to great deeds you're going but to near troubles, and the shortening of your days the time that they are bright and sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre, could not hold you away?  I've said we'd stay in Alban always.  There's no place to stay always. . . . It's a long time we've had, pressing the lips together, going up and down, resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest. . . . It's a long time we've had, but the end has come, surely.   Would you have us go to Emain, though if any ask the reason we do not know it, and we journeying as the thrushes come from the north, or young birds fly out on a dark sea?  There's reason all times for an end that's come. And I'm well pleased, Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the time the sun has a low place, and the moon has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you and I are well lodged our last day, where there is a light behind the clear trees, and the berries on the thorns are a red wall.  If our time in this place is ended, come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the woods of the east, for it's right to be away from all people when two lovers have their love only. Come away and we'll be safe always.  There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world. . . . . And it's in the quiet woods I've seen them digging our grave, throwing out the clay on leaves are bright and withered.  Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little corner between the daytime and the long night.  It's this hour we're between the daytime and a night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't it a better thing to be following on to a near death, than to be bending the head down, and dragging with the feet, and seeing one day a blight showing upon love where it is sweet and tender.  If a near death is coming what will be my trouble losing the earth and the stars over it, and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright crown? Come away into the safety of the woods.  There are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is no way to keep life, or love with it, a short space only. . . . It's for that there's nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleeping. . . . It's for that we're setting out for Emain Macha when the tide turns on the sand.$$$He's a hog on two legs.  You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.  You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.   Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future. We have to wait, you know. We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us.  Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.  Is it--about her sickness?  Yes.  Then--it's serious?  It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.  Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?  Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.
EN348	0	Is it dreaming I am?  Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.  To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same. Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me. Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.  Cut that.  But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?  Sure.  And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow?  Never you mind. Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what you been through.  Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work, darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak. We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!  Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and lie down. You must want to sleep.  Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now. Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand for the last two days we was in it. And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan be wan, tired as I am!  Gee, ain't you a hard guy! But never mind that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.  The hell I am!  Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough stuff when ladies are around.  Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk? Aisy, now! You're not the old Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his cabin with him, no less! But I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of you!$$$Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?  Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.  But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.  Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?  Oh, yes, mum.  Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.  Yes, mum.  Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.  Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.  It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.  The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.  I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.  Me goat, is it?  It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.  My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
EN498	1	Here's health, then, to herself and you!  Here's to the years when you were young as she!  Naisi!  This is the High King's. . . . I see his mark on the rim. Does Conchubor come lodging here?  Who says it's Conchubor's? How dare young fools the like of you -- come prying around, running the world into troubles for some slip of a girl? What brings you this place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.  Is the rain easing?  The clouds are breaking. . . . I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.  Open the door and we'll go forward to the little cabin between the ash-tree and the rocks. Lift the bolt and pull it.  Naisi! Do not leave me, Naisi. I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.  And it is you who go around in the woods making the thrushes bear a grudge against the heavens for the sweetness of your voice singing.  It is with me you've spoken, surely. Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes, into the little hut where we eat, and serve them with what is best and sweetest. I have many thing for Naisi only.  I will do it, and I ask their pardon. I have fooled them here.  Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk into our hut for a little. You will have a supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well pleased to be doing your wish.  Come to this stool, Naisi. If it's low itself the High King would sooner be on it this night than on the throne of Emain Macha.  You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up from all the men of Ulster.  Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons of Usna, and have a little grave by herself, and a story will be told for ever?  It's a long while men have been talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts, and the beauty that has no equal; there are many know it, and there are kings would give a great price to be in my place this night and you grown to a queen.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi. . . . I was in the woods at the full moon and I heard a voice singing. Then I gathered up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a song, and you standing out beyond your brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?  Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe looking for a lamb that had been taken away from her, and one time seeing new gold on the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all times dreading Emain.  Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you born for great company.  This night I have the best company in the whole world.  It is I who have the best company, for when you're queen in Emain you will have none to be your match or fellow.  I will not be queen in Emain.  Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.  It's for that maybe I'm called Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi. . . . . It should be a sweet thing to have what is best and richest, if it's for a short space only.  And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.  You must not go, Naisi, and leave me to the High King, a man is aging in his dun, with his crowds round him, and his silver and gold. I will not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a near death. I'm a long while in the woods with my own self, and I'm in little dread of death, and it earned with riches would make the sun red with envy, and he going up the heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and she wasting away. Isn't it a small thing is foretold about the ruin of our- selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming and great ruin in the end?$$$It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my nose. It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about the rain, and Darcy the devil choke him--and the towering church. Give me that whisky. Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all?  Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.  Is it that?  It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a bad wife in the house.  Is it herself, master of the house, and she a grand woman to talk?  It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still. Let you wait now a short while, and it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. Is that somebody above?  There's a voice speaking on the path.  Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying. Be falling to sleep now and don't let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life. I wouldn't have told you at all but it's destroyed with the drouth I was.  Have no fear, master of the house. What is it I know of the like of you that I'ld be saying a word or putting out my
