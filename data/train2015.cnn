EN042	1	And say, "How clever!" At whatsoever She condescends to say!  Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, To be a regular Royal Queen! No half-and-half affair, I mean, But a right-down regular Royal Queen!   Now, pray, what is the cause of this remarkable hilarity? This sudden ebullition of unmitigated jollity? Has anybody blessed you with a sample of his charity? Or have you been adopted by a gentleman of quality?  Replying, we sing As one individual, As I find I'm a king, To my kingdom I bid you all. I'm aware you object To pavilions and palaces, But you'll find I respect Your Republican fallacies.  As they know we object To pavilions and palaces, How can they respect Our Republican fallacies?    For every one who feels inclined, Some post we undertake to find Congenial with his frame of mind-- And all shall equal be.  The Chancellor in his peruke-- The Earl, the Marquis, and the Dook, The Groom, the Butler, and the Cook-- They all shall equal be.  The Aristocrat who banks with Coutts-- The Aristocrat who hunts and shoots-- The Aristocrat who cleans our boots-- They all shall equal be!  The Noble Lord who rules the State-- The Noble Lord who cleans the plate--  The Noble Lord who scrubs the grate-- They all shall equal be!  The Lord High Bishop orthodox-- The Lord High Coachman on the box--  The Lord High Vagabond in the stocks-- They all shall equal be! For every one, etc.  Sing high, sing low, Wherever they go, They all shall equal be!  CHORUS. Wherever they go, They all shall equal be!  The Earl, the Marquis, and the Dook, The Groom, the Butler, and the Cook, The Aristocrat who banks with Coutts, The Aristocrat who cleans the boots, The Noble Lord who rules the State, The Noble Lord who scrubs the grate, The Lord High Bishop orthodox, The Lord High Vagabond in the stocks--$$$Now let the loyal lieges gather round-- The Prince's foster-mother has been found! She will declare, to silver clarion's sound, The rightful King--let him forthwith be crowned!  She will declare, etc.   Speak, woman, speak--  We're all attention!  The news we seek-  This moment mention.  To us they bring--  His foster-mother.  Is he the King?  Or this my brother?  Speak, woman, speak, etc.    The Royal Prince was by the King entrusted To my fond care, ere I grew old and crusted; When traitors came to steal his son reputed, My own small boy I deftly substituted! The villains fell into the trap completely-- I hid the Prince away--still sleeping sweetly: I called him "son" with pardonable slyness-- His name, Luiz! Behold his Royal Highness!  Luiz!  Casilda!  Get out, sir!  A hit, sir?  Take that, sir!  It's tit, sir,  For tat, sir!   When two doughty heroes thunder, All the world is lost in wonder; When such men their temper lose, Awful are the words they use!  Tall snobs, small snobs, rich snobs and needy ones!  Whom are you alluding to?  Where are you intruding to?  Fat snobs, thin snobs, swell snobs and seedy ones!  I rather think you err. To whom do you refer?  To you, sir!  To me, sir?  I do, sir!  We'll see, sir!  I jeer, sir! Grimace, sir!  Look here, sir-- A face, sir!   When two heroes, once pacific, Quarrel, the effect's terrific! What a horrible grimace! What a paralysing face!  Big bombs, small bombs, etc.  He has insulted me, and, in a breath, This day we fight a duel to the death!  You mean, of course, by duel A Statutory Duel.  Why, what's that?
EN043	0	Don't bring Hannibal in till I know where she's put Edward!  Bad dog! Bad dog!  Maud, do take him out! Tie him up. Here! No--something stronger! Poor darling Edward! You are a bad dog!  Edward began it, Ella. Bad dog! Bad dog!  Tie him up outside. Here, take my scarf. Where is my poor treasure? Catch! His ear's torn; I saw it.  Now! He smells horrible. Bad dog--getting into ponds to fight!  Tie him up, Maud. I must try in here.  Smell him, Bertie! You might have that pond drained, Squire!  All right! I've bound him up!  May I come in?  Just a second! I've got nothing on.  Oh! There you are!  I was just going to wade in----  Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in!  Done him good, little beast!  Why didn't you go in, Tommy?  Well, I would--only she----  I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful mouth!  Bad dog!  We must simply thank her tremendously! I shall never forget the way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist!  All right! Here's a bell!  The bleeding's stopped. Shall I send him in to you?  Oh, please! Poor darling!  Look! Hannibal's loose! Maud--Tommy. You!  Yes, I know--you'd like to! You SHALL bite him when it's safe. Oh! my darling, you DO---- Have you tied him properly this time?  With Bertie's braces.  Oh! but----  It's all right; they're almost leather.      By Jove! No. It was topping.  Her clothes must be ruined. That pond--ugh! Tommy, do have it drained.  I don't remember her face in church.  Ah! Yes. Who is she? Pretty woman!  I must get the Vet. to Edward. Tommy, do exert yourself!$$$We do!  There!  Well, Dick, we wouldn't go for to hurt any fellow creature's feelings, but you can't expect a chap with such a name as Dick Deadeye to be a popular character--now can you?  No.  It's asking too much, ain't it?  It is. From such a face and form as mine the noblest sentiments sound like the black utterances of a depraved imagination It is human nature--I am resigned.   But, tell me--who's the youth whose faltering feet With difficulty bear him on his course?  That is the smartest lad in all the fleet--Ralph Rackstraw!  Ha! That name! Remorse! remorse! The Nightingale Sighed for the moon's bright ray And told his tale In his own melodious way! He sang "Ah, well-a-day!"  He sang "Ah, well-a-day!" The lowly vale For the mountain vainly sighed, To his humble wail The echoing hills replied. They sang "Ah, well-a-day!"  They sang "Ah, well-a-day!"  I know the value of a kindly chorus, But choruses yield little consolation When we have pain and sorrow too before us! I love--and love, alas, above my station!  He loves--and loves a lass above his station!  Yes, yes, the lass is much above his station!    A maiden fair to see, The pearl of minstrelsy, A bud of blushing beauty; For whom proud nobles sigh, And with each other vie To do her menial's duty. To do her menial's duty.  A suitor, lowly born, With hopeless passion torn, And poor beyond denying, Has dared for her to pine At whose exalted shrine A world of wealth is sighing. A world of wealth is sighing.  Unlearned he in aught Save that which love has taught (For love had been his tutor); Oh, pity, pity me-- Our captain's daughter she, And I that lowly suitor! And he that lowly suitor!  Ah, my poor lad, you've climbed too high: our worthy captain's child won't have nothin' to say to a poor chap like you. Will she, lads?  No, no.
EN040	1	Things are seldom what they seem, Skim milk masquerades as cream; Highlows pass as patent leathers; Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.  Very true, So they do. Black sheep dwell in every fold; All that glitters is not gold; Storks turn out to be but logs; Bulls are but inflated frogs.  So they be, Frequentlee.  Drops the wind and stops the mill; Turbot is ambitious brill; Gild the farthing if you will, Yet it is a farthing still.  Yes, I know. That is so. Though to catch your drift I'm striving, It is shady--it is shady; I don't see at what you're driving, Mystic lady--mystic lady. Stern conviction's o'er me stealing, That the mystic lady's dealing In oracular revealing.  Stern conviction's o'er him stealing, That the mystic lady's dealing In oracular revealing. Yes, I know-- That is so!   Though I'm anything but clever, I could talk like that for ever: Once a cat was killed by care; Only brave deserve the fair. Very true, So they do.  Wink is often good as nod; Spoils the child who spares the rod; Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers; Dogs are found in many mangers.  Frequentlee,$$$Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.  Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence. They're all so singularly kind and considerate. You don't find them wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying "It's my turn now." No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and never seem to grudge it.  It makes one feel quite selfish. It almost seems like taking advantage of their good nature.  How nice they were about the double rations.  Most considerate. Ah! there's only one thing wanting to make us thoroughly comfortable.  And that is?  The dear little wives we left behind us three months ago.  Yes, it is dull without female society. We can do without everything else, but we can't do without that.  And if we have that in perfection, we have everything. There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.    Take a pair of sparkling eyes, Hidden, ever and anon, In a merciful eclipse-- Do not heed their mild surprise-- Having passed the Rubicon, Take a pair of rosy lips; Take a figure trimly planned-- Such as admiration whets-- (Be particular in this); Take a tender little hand, Fringed with dainty fingerettes, Press it--in parenthesis;-- Ah! Take all these, you lucky man-- Take and keep them, if you can!  Take a pretty little cot-- Quite a miniature affair-- Hung about with trellised vine, Furnish it upon the spot With the treasures rich and rare I've endeavoured to define. Live to love and love to live-- You will ripen at your ease, Growing on the sunny side-- You're a dainty man to please If you are not satisfied. Ah! Take my counsel, happy man; Act upon it, if you can!  Here we are, at the risk of our lives, From ever so far, and we've brought your wives-- And to that end we've crossed the main, And don't intend to return again!
EN041	1	That's your concern. Don't lie about your poverty. You've a steady well-paid job, and plenty of money to throw away on drunken sprees, I'll bet. The weekly fee at the Hill Farm is only seven dollars. You can easily afford that--the price of a few rounds of drinks.  Seven dollars! And I'll have to pay a woman to come in--and the four of the children eatin' their heads off! Glory be to God, I'll not have a penny saved for me old age--and then it's the poor-house!  Don't talk nonsense!  Ah, doctor, it's the truth I'm tellin' you!  Well, perhaps I can get the Society to pay half for your daughter--if you're really as hard up as you pretend. They're willing to do that where it seems necessary.  Ah, Doctor, thank you.  Then it's all settled?  I'll do my best for Eileen, if it's needful--and you'll not be tellin' them people about it at all, Doctor?  Not unless you force me to.  And they'll pay the half, surely?  I'll see what I can do--for your daughter's sake, not yours, understand!  God bless you, Doctor! It's the whole of it they ought to be payin', I'm thinkin', and them with bags of money. 'Tis them builds the hospitals and why should they be wantin' the poor like me to support them?  Bah! I'll telephone to Doctor Stanton to-morrow morning. Then I'll know something definite when I come to see your daughter in the afternoon.  You'll be comin' again tomorrow? Leave it to the likes of you to be drainin' a man dry.  There's someone knocking.$$$I'll see, surely! I'll see myself and Anna married this day, I'm telling you! It's quare fool's blather you have about the sea done this and the sea done that. You'd ought to be shamed to be saying the like, and you an old sailor yourself. I'm after hearing a lot of it from you and a lot more that Anna's told me you do be saying to her, and I'm thinking it's a poor weak thing you are, and not a man at all!  You see if Ay'm man--maybe quicker'n you tank.  Yerra, don't be boasting. I'm thinking 'tis out of your wits you've got with fright of the sea. You'd be wishing Anna married to a farmer, she told me. That'd be a swate match, surely! Would you have a fine girl the like of Anna lying down at nights with a muddy scut stinking of pigs and dung? Or would you have her tied for life to the like of them skinny, shrivelled swabs does be working in cities?  Dat's lie, you fool!  'Tis not. 'Tis your own mad notions I'm after telling. But you know the truth in your heart, if great fear of the sea has made you a liar and coward itself. The sea's the only life for a man with guts in him isn't afraid of his own shadow! 'Tis only on the sea he's free, and him roving the face of the world, seeing all things, and not giving a damn for saving up money, or stealing from his friends, or any of the black tricks that a landlubber'd waste his life on. 'Twas yourself knew it once, and you a bo'sun for years.  You vas crazy fool, Ay tal you!  You've swallowed the anchor. The sea give you a clout once knocked you down, and you're not man enough to get up for another, but lie there for the rest of your life howling bloody murder. Isn't it myself the sea has nearly drowned, and me battered and bate till I was that close to hell I could hear the flames roaring, and never a groan out of me till the sea gave up and it seeing the great strength and guts of a man was in me?  Yes, you vas hell of fallar, hear you tal it!  You'll be calling me a liar once too often, me old bucko! Wasn't the whole story of it and my picture itself in the newspapers of Boston a week back? Sure I'd like to see you in the best of your youth do the like of what I done in the storm and after. 'Tis a mad lunatic, screeching with fear, you'd be this minute!  Ho-ho! You vas young fool! In ole years when Ay was on windyammer, Ay vas through hundred storms vorse'n dat! Ships vas ships den--and men dat sail on dem vas real men. And now what you gat on steamers? You gat fallars on deck don't know ship from mudscow. And below deck you gat fallars yust know how for shovel coal--might yust as veil vork on coal vagon ashore!  Is it casting insults at the men in the stokehole ye are, ye old ape? God stiffen you! Wan of them is worth any ten stock-fish-swilling Square-heads ever shipped on a windbag!

And how do I look, Nora?  Ye look like a Christmas angel, so you do. Your hair curled just lovely and your striped stockings will be the admiration and envy of the entire Sunday School.   Oh, Nora Eudora, come on quick. Teddy Magee fell in the rain-barrel and it's drownded dead he is intirely.  In the rain-barrel? How did he get in the rain-barrel?  Sure, I was washing him, I was. And he was that slippery with the soap that he slid through me fingers and down to the bottom of the barrel.  Oh, the poor little Teddy Magee.  And how de yeez like me new sash, Peter Pan?  Scwumptious.  It's a tidy cover off'n a bureau, and I don't want to wear it at all, at all. Folks'll be after thinking I'm a bureau. Don't it look funny, Peter Pan?  Scwumptious.  I'm not going to wear it, so I'm not.   Mary Ann Mulligan, and what are yeez trying to do with your nice new sash?  I ain't going to wear no tidy cover. Folks'll be after thinking I'm a bureau.  Sure they'll think worse than that if yeez take it off. That's what comes of yer growing so fast. Yer skirt is fer six years old, and yer waist is fer six years old, and so you have to wear the sash to help out the other two years. Sashes are awful stylish, anyhow. It's pretty, too, ain't it, Peter Pan?  Scwumptious.  It's lucky for him that there wasn't any more water in the rain-barrel, or he would have been drownded dead sure. Patsy, yeez had no business to let him drop. Nora, you go out and finish him. Where's Clarissa?  Here I am, maw.  Well, you're all ready. That's one. Nora and Patsy and Matsy are all ready. That makes four. Mary Ann, are you all fixed?  Yes, mum, but I don't like me sash at all, at all. Folks will all know it's a bureau tidy, it's got fringe and everything.

But here in me kitchen I'm queen With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub.  Oh, give me a nice little home, And plenty of suds in me tub, And I will be happy all day, With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub!  Maw, don't you think it's most time fer us to be going?  Time to be going, is it? Well, I should hope not. Sure, half of the children are not dry yet, and the other half are not dressed. Bridget Honora, darlin', look in the other room and see how they're coming on.  I think we ought to be there early, so as we can get a good seat on the front row. I don't want to miss nothing.  True for you, Matsy, and I don't want yeez to be missing anything either. It ain't like as if yeez go to a fine Christmas entertainment ivery night of yer lives.  It's the first one any of us ever went to at all, at all. Do yeez think they be after having moving pictures?  Of course not. Not in a Sunday School, Matsy. But belike they'll have a fine, grand Christmas tree with singin' and spaches and fine costumes and prisints for every one. Bridget Honora!  Yes, maw?  Come here.  Melissa and Micky Machree have been scrubbed until they shine. They're sitting in the window drying in the sun. Mary Ann is cleaning Peter Pan in the lard bucket, and Patsy is washing Teddy Magee in the rain-barrel. Nora is curling Clarissa's hair with the poker, and somebody's untied the goat.  Untied the goat, is it? Matsy Mulligan, put on yer hat at once and see what's become of Shamus O'Brien. He's a good goat, is Shamus, but he's like the late Mr. Mulligan, he has a rovin' disposition and a tremenjous appetite. Hurry now, Matsy.$$$Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye These floral tributes extraordinary?  For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri, The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.  They're coming here, as we have heard but lately, To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.  Do all you maidens love them?  Passionately!  These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!  But what of us, who one and all adore you?  Have pity on our passion, we implore you!  These gentlemen must make their choice before you;  In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.  When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty-- Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.  Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.  With pleasure, nobody contradicente!  For the merriest fellows are we, tra la, That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;  With loving and laughing, And quipping and quaffing, We're happy as happy can be, tra la-- With loving and laughing, etc. With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la, And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la; And Jealousy yellow, Unfortunate fellow, We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la-- And Jealousy yellow, etc.  See, see, at last they come to make their choice-- Let us acclaim them with united voice.    Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti! Accept our love, our homage, and our duty. Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!  We're called gondolieri, But that's a vagary, It's quite honorary The trade that we ply. For gallantry noted Since we were short-coated, To beauty devoted, Giuseppe\Are Marco and I;  When morning is breaking, Our couches forsaking, To greet their awaking With carols we come. At summer day's nooning, When weary lagooning, Our mandolins tuning, We lazily thrum.  When vespers are ringing, To hope ever clinging, With songs of our singing A vigil we keep, When daylight is fading, Enwrapt in night's shading, With soft serenading We sing them to sleep.  We're called gondolieri, etc.
EN044	0	Attacking across open ground: four machine bullets got me at one go off.  Weren't you veree frightened when they ordered you to attack?  It was great. We did laugh that morning. They got me much too soon, though--a swindle.  You laughed?  Yes. And what do you think was the first thing I was conscious of next morning? My old Colonel bending over me and giving me a squeeze of lemon. If you knew my Colonel you'd still believe in things. There is something, you know, behind all this evil. After all, you can only die once, and, if it's for your country--all the better!  No; I believe in nothing, not even in my country. My heart is dead.  Yes; you think so, but it isn't, you know, or you wouldn't have 'been crying when I met you.  If it were not dead, do you think I could live my life-walking the streets every night, pretending to like strange men; never hearing a kind word; never talking, for fear I will be known for a German? Soon I shall take to drinking; then I shall be "Kaput" veree quick. You see, I am practical; I see things clear. To-night I am a little emotional; the moon is funny, you know. But I live for myself only, now. I don't care for anything or anybody.  All the same; just now you were pitying your folk at home, and prisoners and that.  Yees; because they suffer. Those who suffer are like me--I pity myself, that's all; I am different from your English women. I see what I am doing; I do not let my mind become a turnip just because I am no longer moral.  Nor your heart either, for all you say.  Ni-ice boy, you are veree obstinate. But all that about love is 'umbog. We love ourselves, noting more.  No; we don't only love ourselves; there is more. I can't explain, but there's something great; there's kindness--and--and-----  Take them--I will not haf your English money--take them.  Defeat! Der Vaterland! Defeat!.... One shillin'!$$$Sullen night is laughing day-- All the year is merry May!  And now our lives are going to begin in real earnest! What's a bachelor? A mere nothing--he's a chrysalis. He can't be said to live--he exists.  What a delightful institution marriage is! Why have we wasted all this time? Why didn't we marry ten years ago?  Because you couldn't find anybody nice enough.  Because you were waiting for us.  I suppose that was the reason. We were waiting for you without knowing it. Hallo!  Good morning.  If this gentleman is an undertaker it's a bad omen.  Ceremony of some sort going on?  He is an undertaker! No--a little unimportant family gathering. Nothing in your line.  Somebody's birthday, I suppose?  Yes, mine!  And mine!  And mine!  And mine!  Curious coincidence! And how old may you all be?  It's a rude question--but about ten minutes. Remarkably fine children! But surely you are jesting?  In other words, we were married about ten minutes since.  Married! You don't mean to say you are married?  Oh yes, we are married.  What, both of you?  All four of us.  Bless my heart, how extremely awkward!  You don't mind, I suppose?  You were not thinking of either of us for yourself, I presume? Oh, Giuseppe, look at him--he was. He's heart-broken!  No, no, I wasn't! I wasn't!  Now, my man we don't want anything in your line to-day, and if your curiosity's satisfied--you can go!  You mustn't call me your man. It's a liberty. I don't think you know who I am.  Not we, indeed! We are jolly gondoliers, the sons of Baptisto Palmieri, who led the last revolution. Republicans, heart and soul, we hold all men to be equal. As we abhor oppression, we abhor kings: as we detest vain-glory, we detest rank: as we despise effeminacy, we despise wealth. We are Venetian gondoliers--your equals in everything except our calling, and in that at once your masters and your servants.
EN045	0	Well, God bless who's here! And how is the world treating you this afternoon, Anna's father?  Pooty goot--if it ain't for some fallars.  Meaning me, do you? Well, if you ain't the funny old crank of a man! Where's herself? Where's Anna, I'm after asking you?  She go down end of dock.  I'll be going down to her, then. But first I'm thinking I'll take this chance when we're alone to have a word with you. And that word is soon said. I'm marrying your Anna before this day is out, and you might as well make up your mind to it whether you like it or no.  Ho-ho! Dat's easy for say!  You mean I won't? Is it the like of yourself will stop me, are you thinking?  Yes, Ay stop it, if it come to vorst.  God help you!  But ain't no need for me do dat. Anna--  Is it Anna you think will prevent me?  Yes.  And I'm telling you she'll not. She knows I'm loving her, and she loves me the same, and I know it.  Ho-ho! She only have fun. She make big fool of you, dat's all!  That's a lie in your throat, divil mend you!  No, it ain't lie. She tal me yust before she go out she never marry fallar like you.  I'll not believe it. 'Tis a great old liar you are, and a divil to be making a power of trouble if you had your way. But 'tis not trouble I'm looking for, and me sitting down here. Let us be talking it out now as man to man. You're her father, and wouldn't it be a shame for us to be at each other's throats like a pair of dogs, and I married with Anna. So out with the truth, man alive. What is it you're holding against me at all?$$$Sure, he has. Who do you think takes care of the reindeer, and who waters the doll-tree and picks the dolls?  Picks the dolls? Do the dolls grow on trees?  Yes, indeed, right next door to the taffy cottage, down Chocolate Lane. I take care of the marble bushes and the popgun trees. You just ought to see our wonderful gardens.  Oh, I'd love to see them.  We've got a Teddy-bear garden, and a tool garden, and a  furniture garden, and a game garden, and a candy garden, though most of the candy comes from mines.  The mines?  Sure. We dig out just the kind we want. We have caramel mines, and vanilla mines and mines full of chocolate almonds, and rivers of fig paste and strawberry ice cream soda. They flow right through the picture-book garden.  Oh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.  And I help take care of it. I have fourteen little brothers, and we're all twins.  And have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice-a, fine-a wife?  Of course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever heard of my mother. Her name is Mary.  Mary? Mary what?  Why, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone knew that.  And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night before Christmas?  Oh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and takes care of the gardens.  But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd be with your father.  Ah, that is a secret. You mustn't tell anyone.  How can I tell anyone when I don't know myself.  Well, maybe I'll tell you.

They flow right through the picture-book garden.  Oh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.  And I help take care of it. I have fourteen little brothers, and we're all twins.  And have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice-a, fine-a wife?  Of course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever heard of my mother. Her name is Mary.  Mary? Mary what?  Why, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone knew that.  And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night before Christmas?  Oh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and takes care of the gardens.  But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd be with your father.  Ah, that is a secret. You mustn't tell anyone.  How can I tell anyone when I don't know myself.  Well, maybe I'll tell you.$$$Methought I heard a whir of wings on high.   I see naught save the snow and starry sky.   We've come a long and mighty step today, From o'er the frosty hills and far away.  Look, father, dost thou see that shining star That seems to stand above the town so far? 'Tis like a wondrous blossom on a stem, And see, it ever shines o'er Bethlehem!   A brighter star, I'm sure I never saw-- And perfect form, without a speck or flaw.   A stranger star! It never shone before, It standeth still above that stable door.  Look ye, I've found a little lamb new-born.  Poor little beastie! Wrap him well and warm.  An ill night to be born in, frost and snow, Naught but cold skies above, cold earth below. I marvel any little creature should be born On such a night.   I found it all forlorn, Crying beside its mother in the storm.  Hark, I thought I heard a sound of mighty wings! Listen! Is it the winter sky that sings?  Nay, gran'ther, I heard naught. You're old and gray And weary with the miles you've walked today.   At noon I met a man who tarried in the shade, He led a mule, and riding it a maid-- A maiden with a face I'll ne'er forget, A wondrous face, I seem to see it yet Lit with an inward shining, as if God Had set a lighted lamp within her soul. Many have passed all day, but none like these, And no face have I ever seen like hers.   Belike the man and maid were strangers here, And come to Bethlehem at the king's command.   Methinks I met that very man and maid-- A maiden with such wondrous dove-like eyes, I saw them near this place, all tired and worn, Trudging about the town, seeking an inn.   And did they find one?   Nay, not so!  For every inn was crowded to its doors. Hard by Deborah's inn there is a little barn, All full of cattle, oxen, cooing doves-- I showed it to them, and they went therein.   Mother, that star! That wondrous, wondrous light,

As office boy I made such a mark That they gave me the post of a junior clerk.

EN079	0	No--of course I ain't. Well, I'll tell you. I'm a governess, see? I take care of kids for people and learn them things.  A governess, is it? You must be smart, surely.  But let's not talk about me. Tell me about the wreck, like you promised me you would.  'Twas this way, Miss. Two weeks out we ran into the divil's own storm, and she sprang wan hell of a leak up for'ard. The skipper was hoping to make Boston before another blow would finish her, but ten days back we met up with another storm the like of the first, only worse. Four days we was in it with green seas raking over her from bow to stern. That was a terrible time, God help us. And if 'twasn't for me and my great strength, I'm telling you--and it's God's truth--there'd been mutiny itself in the stokehole. 'Twas me held them to it, with a kick to wan and a clout to another, and they not caring a damn for the engineers any more, but fearing a clout of my right arm more than they'd fear the sea itself.  You did some hard work, didn't you?  I did that! I'm a divil for sticking it out when them that's weak give up. But much good it did anyone! 'Twas a mad, fightin' scramble in the last seconds with each man for himself. I disremember how it come about, but there was the four of us in wan boat and when we was raised high on a great wave I took a look about and divil a sight there was of ship or men on top of the sea.  Then all the others was drowned?  BURKE--They was, surely.  What a terrible end!  A terrible end for the like of them swabs does live on land, maybe. But for the like of us does be roaming the seas, a good end, I'm telling you--quick and clane.  Yes, clean. That's yust the word for--all of it--the way it makes me feel.  The sea, you mean? I'm thinking you have a bit of it in your blood, too. Your Old Man wasn't only a barge rat--begging your pardon--all his life, by the cut of him.  No, he was bo'sun on sailing ships for years. And all the men on both sides of the family have gone to sea as far back as he remembers, he says. All the women have married sailors, too.  Did they, now? They had spirit in them. It's only on the sea you'd find rale men with guts is fit to wed with fine, high-tempered girls the like of yourself.$$$And you must not forget the leetla Dutch twins, and my cousin Tomasso, and Hulda and Meeny and Sergius and Ah Goo and Sano San and Needla and Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike and all the rest.  Whew! That's a big order. But we won't forget a single soul on Christmas Day. And now I've got to go and put the finishing touches on--you know what!  Why, he's gone.  The sun has set, it's out of sight, so little Jack Frost will say good-night! itself if it was-a not nailed to the deck. Hurry, Anita!  I goIt's a awful good-a secret, Tomasso.  Ah, the great, grand-a lady moon. She looks at me, I look at her. Maybe she'll like a leetla serenade.  Sure, that's beautiful. It takes me back again to dear ould Ireland where the River Shannon flows.  What do you do in Ireland the night before Christmas, Biddy Mary?  Do you have a Christmas tree like we do in Germany?  We do not. We don't have any tree at all, at all.  And we don't get many presents. But it's a fine time we have for all that. Instead of getting presents, we have the fun of giving presents--and that's the finest thing in all the world, so it is, to make the other fellow happy. Sure, I just love to give presents.  You can give me some if you want to.  Und me also some.  But where would we be getting presents out here in the middle of the ocean? In dear ould Ireland sure it's a fine time we're after having on Christmas Day.  It is that. With the fiddles playing and the dancers dancing and the fine suppers upon the table.  In Russia we always set a table in front of the window and put a fine linen cloth on it. Here is the cloth, but we have no window.  Here, use this box as a table. Now, let us put the cloth on, so!

It's easy to see you've got Irish in you. Do you know what I think? I think you're a natural born kidder. All newspaper reporters are like that, I've heard.  You wrong me terribly. And it isn't charitable to remind me of my job. I hoped to forget all about it up here.  I think it's great to be able to write. I wish I could. You ought to be proud of it.  I'm not. You can't call it writing--not what I did--small town stuff. But I wanted to ask you something. Do you know when I'm to be moved away to the huts?  In a few days, I guess. Don't be impatient. What's the matter? Don't you like us here at the Sanatorium?  Oh--you--yes! I don't care for the atmosphere, though. All those people in bed out there on the porch seem so sick. It's depressing. I can't do anything for them--and--it makes me feel so helpless.  Well, it's the rules, you know. All the patients have to come here first until Doctor Stanton finds out whether they're well enough to be sent out to the huts and cottages. And remember you're a patient just like the ones in bed out there--even if you are up and about.  I know it. But I don't feel as I were--really sick like them.  None of them do, either.  Yes, I suppose it's that pipe dream that keeps us all going, eh?  Well, you ought to be thankful. You're very lucky, if you knew it. Shall I tell you a secret? I've seen your chart and _you've_ no cause to worry. Doctor Stanton joked about it. He said you were too uninteresting--there was so little the matter with you.$$$Attacking across open ground: four machine bullets got me at one go off.  Weren't you veree frightened when they ordered you to attack?  It was great. We did laugh that morning. They got me much too soon, though--a swindle.  You laughed?  Yes. And what do you think was the first thing I was conscious of next morning? My old Colonel bending over me and giving me a squeeze of lemon. If you knew my Colonel you'd still believe in things. There is something, you know, behind all this evil. After all, you can only die once, and, if it's for your country--all the better!  No; I believe in nothing, not even in my country. My heart is dead.  Yes; you think so, but it isn't, you know, or you wouldn't have 'been crying when I met you.  If it were not dead, do you think I could live my life-walking the streets every night, pretending to like strange men; never hearing a kind word; never talking, for fear I will be known for a German? Soon I shall take to drinking; then I shall be "Kaput" veree quick. You see, I am practical; I see things clear. To-night I am a little emotional; the moon is funny, you know. But I live for myself only, now. I don't care for anything or anybody.  All the same; just now you were pitying your folk at home, and prisoners and that.  Yees; because they suffer. Those who suffer are like me--I pity myself, that's all; I am different from your English women. I see what I am doing; I do not let my mind become a turnip just because I am no longer moral.  Nor your heart either, for all you say.  Ni-ice boy, you are veree obstinate. But all that about love is 'umbog. We love ourselves, noting more.  No; we don't only love ourselves; there is more. I can't explain, but there's something great; there's kindness--and--and-----  Take them--I will not haf your English money--take them.  Defeat! Der Vaterland! Defeat!.... One shillin'!

Mr. Snookie Ookums, let me introduce you to Mr. Jim Dandy, a stick of candy.  Would he mind if I'd take a bite out of his leg?  You bet he would. I'm alive now.  And here comes Teddy Bear and Jimmy Bear. They're alive, too. And look at the Baby Elephant.$$$Sure, he has. Who do you think takes care of the reindeer, and who waters the doll-tree and picks the dolls?  Picks the dolls? Do the dolls grow on trees?  Yes, indeed, right next door to the taffy cottage, down Chocolate Lane. I take care of the marble bushes and the popgun trees. You just ought to see our wonderful gardens.  Oh, I'd love to see them.  We've got a Teddy-bear garden, and a tool garden, and a  furniture garden, and a game garden, and a candy garden, though most of the candy comes from mines.  The mines?  Sure.

Well, children, what do you think of the Wishing Land?  It's awfully pretty.  It's perfectly gorgeous.  Wunnerful, simply wunnerful.  Here's where I grow my toys. See, there is the trumpet vine, and the candy tree and the dolly flowers. Whenever a little child makes a wish for anything like that, all I have to do is to come in here and pick a toy.

Yes, Little Buttercup, I'm sad and sorry-- My daughter, Josephine, the fairest flower That ever blossomed on ancestral timber, Is sought in marriage by Sir Joseph Porter, Our Admiralty's First Lord, but for some reason She does not seem to tackle kindly to it.  Ah, poor Sir Joseph! Ah, I know too well The anguish of a heart that loves but vainly! But see, here comes your most attractive daughter. I go--Farewell!  A plump and pleasing person!   Sorry her lot who loves too well, Heavy the heart that hopes but vainly, Sad are the sighs that own the spell, Uttered by eyes that speak too plainly; Heavy the sorrow that bows the head When love is alive and hope is dead!  Sad is the hour when sets the sun-- Dark is the night to earth's poor daughters, When to the ark the wearied one Flies from the empty waste of waters! Heavy the sorrow that bows the head When love is alive and hope is dead!    My child, I grieve to see that you are a prey to melancholy. You should look your best to-day, for Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., will be here this afternoon to claim your promised hand.  Ah, father, your words cut me to the quick. I can esteem-- reverence--venerate Sir Joseph, for he is a great and good man; but oh, I cannot love him! My heart is already given.  It is then as I feared. (Aloud.) Given? And to whom? Not to some gilded lordling?  No, father--the object of my love is no lordling. Oh, pity me, for he is but a humble sailor on board your own ship!

Meeny and Yakob and Hans and leetla Mieze have hung up their stockings for the good-a Saint Nicholas, but in Italy we set out our shoes, so! And we always get them full of presents.  I like stockings much better than shoes already, because the stockings can stretch yet, und if they stretch real, real wide out maybe we can get a baby piano or a automobile in our stockings. Jah, stockings is mooch better als shoes.  Here is my beautiful star. That will remind us of the Star of Bethlehem that led the three Wise Men across the hills and plains of Judea unto the little manger where, surrounded by cattle and oxen, amid the straw, the Lord of Heaven was born on Christmas Eve.  Und all the angels sang, "Peace on earth, good will to men," didn't they, Klinker?  Und all the shepherds heard them, and they followed the star and came to the manger to see the little Baby.  Let us all sit down here in front of the candle and the star, and see if old Santa Claus has forgotten us already. It's almost time for him to be coming. Oh, I do hope Santa Claus will come and visit us tonight. But of course he cannot go every place. Some children have to be left out.  Yes, that's so; but I hope it ain't us.

I am not fond of men at all. When you know--you are not fond of them.  Well, you hardly know them at their best, do you? You should see them in the trenches. By George! They're simply splendid--officers and men, every blessed soul. There's never been anything like it--just one long bit of jolly fine self-sacrifice; it's perfectly amazing.  I expect you are not the last at that. You see in them what you haf in yourself, I think.  Oh, not a bit; you're quite out! I assure you when we made the attack where I got wounded there wasn't a single man in my regiment who wasn't an absolute hero. The way they went in--never thinking of themselves--it was simply ripping.  It is the same too, perhaps, with--the enemy.  Oh, yes! I know that.  Ah! You are not a mean man. How I hate mean men!

Have I not hands and eyes and ears and limbs like another?  Aye, Aye!  True, I lack birth--  You've a berth on board this very ship.  Well said--I had forgotten that. Messmates--what do yousay? Do you approve my determination?  We do.  I don t.  What is to be done with this here hopeless chap? Let us sing him the song that Sir Joseph has kindly composed for us. Perhaps it will bring this here miserable creetur to a proper state of mind.  A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic fist should be ready to resist A dictatorial word. His nose should pant and his lip should curl, His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl, His bosom should heave and his heart should glow, And his fist be ever ready for a knock-down blow.$$$Dogs take to her. That's a sure sign.  Little things--one can always tell.  Something very attractive about her--what! Fine build of woman.  I shall get hold of her for parish work.  Ah! Excellent--excellent! Do!  Wonder if her husband shoots? She seems quite-er--quite----  Quite! Altogether charming; one of the nicest faces I ever saw.   Oh! Doctor--have you? is it----?  Right as rain! She held him like an angel--he just licked her, and never made a sound.  Poor darling! Can I----    Better leave 'em a minute. She's moppin' 'im off. Wonderful clever hands!  I say--who is she?  Who? Well--there you have me! All I know is she's a first-rate nurse--been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane. Nice woman, too--thorough good sort! Quite an acquisition here. H'm! Excuse me hurryin' off--very late. Good-bye, Rector. Good-bye, Lady Ella. Good-bye!    H'm! I suppose we ought to be a bit careful.   Beg pardon, sir. Is the little dog all right?  Yes.  Seein' you've missed your train, m'm, shall I wait, and take you 'ome again?  No.  Cert'nly, m'm.  Oh, Jarvis--what's the name of the people here?  Challenger's the name I've driven 'em in, my lady.  Challenger? Sounds like a hound. What's he like?  Wears a soft 'at, sir.  H'm! Ah!  Very nice gentleman, very nice lady. 'Elped me with my old mare when she 'ad the 'ighsteria last week--couldn't 'a' been kinder if they'd 'a' been angels from 'eaven. Wonderful fond o' dumb animals, the two of 'em. I don't pay no attention to gossip, meself.  Gossip? What gossip?  Did I make use of the word, m'm? You'll excuse me, I'm sure. There's always talk where there's newcomers. I takes people as I finds 'em.

Maw, don't you think it's most time fer us to be going?  Time to be going, is it? Well, I should hope not. Sure, half of the children are not dry yet, and the other half are not dressed. Bridget Honora, darlin', look in the other room and see how they're coming on.  I think we ought to be there early, so as we can get a good seat on the front row. I don't want to miss nothing.  True for you, Matsy, and I don't want yeez to be missing anything either. It ain't like as if yeez go to a fine Christmas entertainment ivery night of yer lives.  It's the first one any of us ever went to at all, at all. Do yeez think they be after having moving pictures?  Of course not. Not in a Sunday School, Matsy. But belike they'll have a fine, grand Christmas tree with singin' and spaches and fine costumes and prisints for every one. Bridget Honora!  Yes, maw?  Come here.  Melissa and Micky Machree have been scrubbed until they shine. They're sitting in the window drying in the sun. Mary Ann is cleaning Peter Pan in the lard bucket, and Patsy is washing Teddy Magee in the rain-barrel. Nora is curling Clarissa's hair with the poker, and somebody's untied the goat.  Untied the goat, is it? Matsy Mulligan, put on yer hat at once and see what's become of Shamus O'Brien. He's a good goat, is Shamus, but he's like the late Mr. Mulligan, he has a rovin' disposition and a tremenjous appetite. Hurry now, Matsy.$$$Now, sir, we're all ready for rehearsal of "Orpheus with his Lute."  "Orphoos with his loot!" That his loot, Mr Vane? Why didn't he pinch something more precious? Has this high-brow curtain-raiser of yours got any "pep" in it?  It has charm.  I'd thought of "Pop goes the Weasel" with little Miggs. We kind of want a cock-tail before "Louisa loses," Mr Vane.  Well, sir, you'll see.  This your lighting? It's a bit on the spiritool side. I've left my glass. Guess I'll sit in the front row. Ha'f a minute. Who plays this Orphoos?  George Fleetway.  Has he got punch?  It's a very small part.  Who are the others?  Guy Toone plays the Professor; Vanessa Hellgrove his wife; Maude Hopkins the faun.  H'm! Names don't draw.  They're not expensive, any of them. Miss Hellgrove's a find, I think.  Pretty?  Quite.  Arty?  No. Look here, Mr FRUST, it's no use your expecting another "Pop goes the Weasel."  We-ell, if it's got punch and go, that'll be enough for me. Let's get to it!  Mr Foreson?  Sir?  Beginners. Take your curtain down.  Some voice!  "Orpheus symbolized the voice of Beauty, the call of life, luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for ourselves. Probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less  Arty?  No. Look here, Mr FRUST, it's no use your expecting another "Pop goes the Weasel."  We-ell, if it's got punch and go, that'll be enough for me. Let's get to it!  Mr Foreson?  Sir?  Beginners.

Then you think's he'll stake me to that rest cure I'm after?  Surest thing you know. But where'd yuh get the idea he was a janitor?  He wrote me he was himself.  Well, he was lyin'. He ain't. He's captain of a barge--five men under him.  A barge? What kind of a barge?  Coal, mostly.  A coal barge! If that ain't a swell job to find your long lost Old Man working at! Gee, I knew something'd be bound to turn out wrong--always does with me. That puts my idea of his giving me a rest on the bum.  What d'yuh mean?  I s'pose he lives on the boat, don't he?  Sure. What about it? Can't you live on it, too?  Me? On a dirty coal barge! What d'you think I am?  What d'yuh know about barges, huh? Bet yuh ain't never seen one. That's what comes of his bringing yuh up inland--away from the old devil sea--where yuh'd be safe--Gawd!  His bringing me up! Is that what he tells people! I like his nerve! He let them cousins of my Old Woman's keep me on their farm and work me to death like a dog.  Well, he's got queer notions on some things. I've heard him say a farm was the best place for a kid.  Sure. That's what he'd always answer back--and a lot of crazy stuff about staying away from the sea--stuff I couldn't make head or tail to. I thought he must be nutty.  He is on that one point. So yuh didn't fall for life on the farm, huh?  I should say not! The old man of the family, his wife, and four sons--I had to slave for all of 'em. I was only a poor relation, and they treated me worse than they dare treat a hired girl. It was one of the sons--the youngest--started me--when I was sixteen. After that, I hated 'em so I'd killed 'em all if I'd stayed. So I run away--to St. Paul.$$$And say, "How clever!" At whatsoever She condescends to say!  Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, To be a regular Royal Queen! No half-and-half affair, I mean, But a right-down regular Royal Queen!   Now, pray, what is the cause of this remarkable hilarity? This sudden ebullition of unmitigated jollity? Has anybody blessed you with a sample of his charity? Or have you been adopted by a gentleman of quality?  Replying, we sing As one individual, As I find I'm a king, To my kingdom I bid you all. I'm aware you object To pavilions and palaces, But you'll find I respect Your Republican fallacies.

Yes, yes, I'll do all I can.  And don't take it to heart too much yourself. There's every hope, remember that. In six months she'll come back to you her old self again.  It's hard on a fellow--so suddenly--but I'll remember--and---- Good night, Doctor.  Good night.  Has he gone away?  Yes. He told me to tell you he'd be back to-morrow with definite information--about the sanatorium business.  Oho, he did, did he? Maybe I'll surprise him. I'm thinkin' it's lyin' he is about Eileen's sickness, and her lookin' as fresh as a daisy with the high colour in her cheeks when I saw her now.  That's silly, Mr. Carmody. Gaynor knows his business. He told me all about Eileen's sickness.  Did he now, the auld monkey! Small thanks to him to be tellin' our secrets to the town.  I didn't want to learn your affairs. He only told me because you'd said I and Eileen were engaged. You're the one who was telling--secrets.  Ara, don't be talkin'! That's no secret at all with the whole town watchin' Eileen and you spoonin' together from the time you was kids.  Well, the whole town is liable to find out----  To hell with the town and all in it! I've troubles enough of my own. So he told you he'd send Eileen away to the hospital? I've half a mind not to let him--and let him try to make me! (_With a frown._) But Eileen herself says she's wantin' to go, now. (_Angrily._) It's all that divil's notion he put in her head that the children'd be catchin' her sickness that makes her willin' to go.$$$Methought I heard a whir of wings on high.   I see naught save the snow and starry sky.   We've come a long and mighty step today, From o'er the frosty hills and far away.  Look, father, dost thou see that shining star That seems to stand above the town so far? 'Tis like a wondrous blossom on a stem, And see, it ever shines o'er Bethlehem!   A brighter star, I'm sure I never saw-- And perfect form, without a speck or flaw.   A stranger star! It never shone before, It standeth still above that stable door.  Look ye, I've found a little lamb new-born.  Poor little beastie! Wrap him well and warm.  An ill night to be born in, frost and snow, Naught but cold skies above, cold earth below. I marvel any little creature should be born On such a night.   I found it all forlorn, Crying beside its mother in the storm.  Hark, I thought I heard a sound of mighty wings! Listen! Is it the winter sky that sings?  Nay, gran'ther, I heard naught. You're old and gray And weary with the miles you've walked today.   At noon I met a man who tarried in the shade, He led a mule, and riding it a maid-- A maiden with a face I'll ne'er forget, A wondrous face, I seem to see it yet Lit with an inward shining, as if God Had set a lighted lamp within her soul. Many have passed all day, but none like these, And no face have I ever seen like hers.   Belike the man and maid were strangers here, And come to Bethlehem at the king's command.   Methinks I met that very man and maid-- A maiden with such wondrous dove-like eyes, I saw them near this place, all tired and worn, Trudging about the town, seeking an inn.   And did they find one?   Nay, not so!  For every inn was crowded to its doors. Hard by Deborah's inn there is a little barn, All full of cattle, oxen, cooing doves-- I showed it to them, and they went therein.   Mother, that star! That wondrous, wondrous light,

Allow me to present--  The young lady one of us married?  CAS. Gentlemen, I am the most obedient servant of one of you. Oh, Luiz!  I am now about to address myself to the gentleman whom my daughter married; the other may allow his attention to wander if he likes, for what I am about to say does not concern him. Sir, you will find in this young lady a combination of excellences which you would search for in vain in any young lady who had not the good fortune to be my daughter. There is some little doubt as to which of you is the gentleman I am addressing, and which is the gentleman who is allowing his attention to wander; but when that doubt is solved, I shall say , "Take her, and may she make you happier than her mother has made me."  Sir!  If possible. And now there is a little matter to which I think I am entitled to take exception. I come here in state with Her Grace the Duchess and Her Majesty my daughter, and what do I find? Do I find, for instance, a guard of honour to receive me? No!  No.  The town illuminated? No!  No.   Refreshment provided? No!  No.  A Royal salute fired? No!  No.  Triumphal arches erected? No!  No.  The bells set ringing?  No.  Yes--one--the Visitors', and I rang it myself. It is not enough! It is not enough!

That's all very well in its way, but it is not enough.$$$I forget nothing, haughty lady. I love you desperately, my life is in your hand--I lay it at your feet! Give me hope, and what I lack in education and polite accomplishments, that I will endeavour to acquire. Drive me to despair, and in death alone I shall look for consolation. I am proud and cannot stoop to implore. I have spoken and I wait your word.  You shall not wait long. Your proffered love I haughtily reject. Go, sir, and learn to cast your eyes on some village maiden in your own poor rank--they should be lowered before your captain's daughter.   Refrain, audacious tar, Your suit from pressing, Remember what you are, And whom addressing! I'd laugh my rank to scorn In union holy, Were he more highly born Or I more lowly! Proud lady, have your way, Unfeeling beauty! You speak and I obey, It is my duty! I am the lowliest tar That sails the water, And you, proud maiden, are My captain's daughter! My heart with anguish torn Bows down before her, She laughs my love to scorn, Yet I adore her!   Can I survive this overbearing Or live a life of mad despairing, My proffered love despised, rejected? No, no, it's not to be expected! (Calling off.) Messmates, ahoy! Come here! Come here!   Aye, aye, my boy, What cheer, what cheer? Now tell us, pray, Without delay, What does she say-- What cheer, what cheer?  The maiden treats my suit with scorn, Rejects my humble gift, my lady; She says I am ignobly born, And cuts my hopes adrift, my lady. Oh, cruel one.  She spurns your suit? Oho! Oho! I told you so, I told you so.   Shall { we } submit? Are { we } but slaves? they they Love comes alike to high and low-- Britannia's sailors rule the waves, And shall they stoop to insult? No!  You must submit, you are but slaves; A lady she! Oho! Oho! You lowly toilers of the waves, She spurns you all--I told you so!  My friends, my leave of life I'm taking, For oh, my heart, my heart is breaking. When I am gone, oh, prithee tell The maid that, as I died, I loved her well!
EN017	0	It's a wonder you wouldn't stop this machine grinding itself to bits, Mr. Murray.  I was hoping the darn thing would bust. It keeps you from talking to me. That's the real music.  It's easy to see you've got Irish in you. Do you know what I think? I think you're a natural born kidder. All newspaper reporters are like that, I've heard.  You wrong me terribly. And it isn't charitable to remind me of my job. I hoped to forget all about it up here.  I think it's great to be able to write. I wish I could. You ought to be proud of it.  I'm not. You can't call it writing--not what I did--small town stuff. But I wanted to ask you something. Do you know when I'm to be moved away to the huts?  In a few days, I guess. Don't be impatient. What's the matter? Don't you like us here at the Sanatorium?  Oh--you--yes! I don't care for the atmosphere, though. All those people in bed out there on the porch seem so sick. It's depressing. I can't do anything for them--and--it makes me feel so helpless.  Well, it's the rules, you know. All the patients have to come here first until Doctor Stanton finds out whether they're well enough to be sent out to the huts and cottages. And remember you're a patient just like the ones in bed out there--even if you are up and about.  I know it. But I don't feel as I were--really sick like them.  None of them do, either.  Yes, I suppose it's that pipe dream that keeps us all going, eh?  Well, you ought to be thankful. You're very lucky, if you knew it. Shall I tell you a secret? I've seen your chart and _you've_ no cause to worry. Doctor Stanton joked about it. He said you were too uninteresting--there was so little the matter with you.$$$Well, I haf just one shilling now!  I say, what's your name?  May. Well, I call myself that. It is no good asking yours.  You're a distrustful little soul; aren't you?  I haf reason to be, don't you think?  Yes. I suppose you're bound to think us all brutes.  Well, I haf a lot of reasons to be afraid all my time. I am dreadfully nervous now; I am not trusding anybody. I suppose you haf been killing lots of Germans?  We never know, unless it happens to be hand to hand; I haven't come in for that yet.  But you would be very glad if you had killed some.  Oh, glad? I don't think so. We're all in the same boat, so far as that's concerned. We're not glad to kill each other--not most of us. We do our job--that's all.  Oh! It is frightful. I expect I haf my brothers killed.  Don't you get any news ever?  News? No indeed, no news of anybody in my country. I might not haf a country; all that I ever knew is gone; fader, moder, sisters, broders, all; never any more I shall see them, I suppose, now. The war it breaks and breaks, it breaks hearts. [She gives a little snarl] Do you know what I was thinking when you came up to me? I was thinking of my native town, and the river in the moonlight. If I could see it again I would be glad. Were you ever homeseeck?  Yes, I have been--in the trenches. But one's ashamed with all the others.  Ah! Yees! Yees! You are all comrades there. What is it like for me here, do you think, where everybody hates and despises me, and would catch me and put me in prison, perhaps. [Her breast heaves.]  Sorry--sorry.
EN016	1	Whoa, there, Jimmie! Oh, Grandpa, I do love my pony. It's the best of all my presents.  Well, it's time you put him in his stall.  I'm going to call my pony after Mr. ----. 'Cause he looks just like him.  And what are you going to call your pony, Snookums?  Going to call him Elizabeth, after you, Grandma.  That's my baby!  Grandma, we'd better get our hats and coats. It's nearly time for the car to be after us.  Come, Grandpa. It's nearly eight o'clock.  But I don't like to leave the children.  And we don't like to have you leave us, either. My, this has been the grandest Christmas day I've ever seen.  Come, Grandma.  Come, children. I'm glad you've had such a happy Christmas. You got everything you wanted, didn't you?  Yes, everything. My, I wish Christmas would come every day.  Tell us the story about old Saint Nick, Grandpa.  Do you want to hear that old chestnut again?  Oh, yes, yes!  Oh, that was just lovely.  I just wish I could see him. Just once!  And so do I. I'm going to catch him some Christmas Eve.  Me, too! Here, Grandpa, put on your coat and hat, or we'll be late for the dinner.  I'd rather stay here and talk to the children.  But Aunt Clara is expecting us.  And the auto is at the door.  Dumpling, are you sure you got everything you wanted for Christmas?  I can't think of anything else.  If you didn't, and if all three of you children can agree on anything else, it shall be yours if money can buy it.  Money can buy everything, can't it, Grandpa?  No, my dear, not quite everything.  But suppose we wish for something that money can't buy?  I'd try to get it for you some other way.$$$That's because they didn't know them. They didn't expect you at the party.  It was a surprise party, maw.  How was it a surprise party, Mary Ann?  They all looked surprised when we came in.  When I saw they weren't going to call out our names, I just rose up in me seat and took the whole nine of 'em by the hand and marched right up to Santa Claus. He looked real surprised at the bunch of us.  I should think he would.  "And who are you?" says he. "We're the ten little Mulligans from Mulligan Alley in Shantytown," says I, as cool as an icicle. "And we're ready for our presents, if it's all the same to you," says I. I thought they was going to fire us out, but what did he do but dive way down in the bottom of the sack and give every last one of us a present?  And then he gave us bags of candy and oranges and apples and peanuts and popcorn and a candy cane, and then they had a show and Bridget Honora spoke a piece, she did.  How did ye happen to spake a piece, Bridget Honora?  I just stood up and told 'em I knowed one. There ain't nuthin' bashful about me. And I kind o' thought we ought to do something to help pay fer the good things they gave us.  That's me good little Bridget Honora.  Oh, wee! Lookee there! Where'd she come from?  Santa Claus was after being here while you were away and he left it for you.  Is it all for me?  It's the Mulligan dolly. It's fer all ten of yeez.  She can have my share. I don't want no dolls.  Oh, look at the efulunt. Look at the efulunt.  That is Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan from the sunny shores of Africa, way down in Louisiana.  Who's he fur? Who's he fur?
EN011	0	Not for mine. I'm full up. And you-- Had anythin' to eat lately?  Not since this morning on the train.  Then yuh better go easy on it, hadn't yuh?  Guess you're right. I got to meet someone, too. But my nerves is on edge after that rotten trip.  Yuh said yuh was just outa the hospital?  Two weeks ago. The joint I was in out in St. Paul got raided. That was the start. The judge give all us girls thirty days. The others didn't seem to mind being in the cooler much. Some of 'em was used to it. But me, I couldn't stand it. It got my goat right--couldn't eat or sleep or nothing. I never could stand being caged up nowheres. I got good and sick and they had to send me to the hospital. It was nice there. I was sorry to leave it, honest!  Did yuh say yuh got to meet someone here?  Yes. Oh, not what you mean. It's my Old Man I got to meet. Honest! It's funny, too. I ain't seen him since I was a kid--don't even know what he looks like--yust had a letter every now and then. This was always the only address he give me to write him back. He's yanitor of some building here now--used to be a sailor.  Janitor!  Sure. And I was thinking maybe, seeing he ain't never done a thing for me in my life, he might be willing to stake me to a room and eats till I get rested up. Gee, I sure need that rest! I'm knocked out. But I ain't expecting much from him. Give you a kick when you're down, that's what all men do. Men, I hate 'em--all of 'em! And I don't expect he'll turn out no better than the rest. Say, do you hang out around this dump much?  Oh, off and on.  Then maybe you know him--my Old Man--or at least seen him?  It ain't old Chris, is it?  Old Chris?  Chris Christopherson, his full name is.  Yes, that's him! Anna Christopherson--that's my real name--only out there I called myself Anna Christie. So you know him, eh?  Seen him about for years.  Say, what's he like, tell me, honest?  Oh, he's short and--$$$Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical! Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical! Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks! Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks! Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled, Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld, The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man, Aerial Artists from far-off Japan, Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun, Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!  The senor is looking for a wife. Oh, you needn't laugh! It's true. Some of you near-sighted ladies should have brought magnifying glasses, for Senor Macaroni Spaghetti is the smallest speck of humanity that ever lived in captivity. He stands on a silver dollar and puts his hand in a thimble. The senor will now entertain you in his entertaining way.    And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'll call your attention to the seven little Sunbonnet babies. Behold them, them famous Mulligan twins.  Nora! Bridget! Mary Ann! What do ye mane! You'll kill yourselves entirely. If you stand on your head like that, all your brains will rush down into your fate.  That's the way they did in the show.   Well, well, well, wonders will never cease. Sure, I niver spint such a fine Christmas Eve in all me life before. Sure, I think we've had a fine Christmas celebration, don't you? And before ye go let this sink down deep in your hearts and minds--it doesn't take money and fine clothes and costly gifts to make a fine Christmas at all, at all. All it takes is loving hearts and loving hands, and merry faces of happy boys and girls. We didn't have any money--but you see what a lovely time we've had--and it's all because the spirit of Christmas was in our hearts--and the spirit of Christmas means love, and love is the greatest thing in all the world. Merry Christmas to all of yeez, and may ye never regret the time you spent Christmas Eve with the ten little Mulligans.

I warn't 'specially anxious the man at the wheel should catch what I wanted to say to you, sir. That's why I asked you to come below.  Speak your say, Mr. Slocum.  I'm afeared there'll be trouble with the hands by the look o' things. They'll likely turn ugly, every blessed one o' them, if you don't put back. The two years they signed up for is up to-day.  And d'you think you're tellin' me something new, Mr. Slocum? I've felt it in the air this long time past. D'you think I've not seen their ugly looks and the grudgin' way they worked?  Well, Annie?

There's nothing to look at on deck--but ice.  I know--ice, ice, ice! But there's nothing to see down here but these walls.  You can play the organ, Annie.  I hate the organ. It puts me in mind of home.  I got it jest for you!  I know. Ah, water! Clear water! As far as I can see! How good it looks after all these months of ice! Ah, now I must go up on deck and look at it, David!  Best not to-day, Annie. Best wait for a day when the sun shines.  But the sun never shines in this terrible place.  Best not to-day, Annie.  Very well, David.  Annie!  Yes, David.  Me and Mr. Slocum has business to talk about--ship's business.  Very well, David.  Best not have her on deck if they's goin' to be any trouble.  Yes, sir.  And trouble they's going to be. I feel it in my bones. Got your'n?  Yes, sir.  Not that we'll have to use 'em--not if I know their breed of dog--jest to frighten 'em up a bit. I ain't never been forced to use one yit; and trouble I've had by land and by sea s'long as I kin remember, and will have till my dyin' day, I reckon.  Then you ain't goin'--to turn back?  Turn back!

You've been wishing that _you_ could meet the Wishing Man and that he would make your wishes come true. Now, haven't you? Well, I've made that wish come true. You wished to meet me, and here I am. I've been watching you all the year in Sunday School. I know how you have worked over your lessons, how you have helped your teachers and how punctual you have been. To be sure, I know some of you haven't helped your teachers as much as you could have done, but I'll forget all that at Christmas time. Now tell me what you wish for most.

Supposing he's right in what he says, This is the style of thing precisely!  The old birds have gone away and left the young chickens together. That's called tact.  It's very awkward. We really ought to tell her how we are situated. It's not fair to the girl. Then why don't you do it?  I'd rather not--you.  I don't know how to begin. Er--Madam--I--we, that is, several of us--  Gentlemen, I am bound to listen to you; but it is right to tell you that, not knowing I was married in infancy, I am over head and ears in love with somebody else.  Our case exactly! We are over head and ears in love with somebody else! In point of fact, with our wives!  Your wives! Then you are married?  It's not our fault.  We knew nothing about it.  We are sisters in misfortune.  My good girls, I don't blame you. Only before we go any further we must really arrive at some satisfactory arrangement, or we shall get hopelessly complicated.  Here is a case unprecedented! Here are a King and Queen ill-starred! Ever since marriage was first invented Never was known a case so hard!  I may be said to have been bisected, By a profound catastrophe!  Through a calamity unexpected I am divisible into three!  O moralists all, How can you call Marriage a state of unitee, When excellent husbands are bisected, And wives divisible into three? O moralists all, How can you call Marriage a state of union true?  One-third of myself is married to half of ye or you,  When half of myself has married one-third of ye or you?$$$In serving writs I made such a name That an articled clerk I soon became; I wore clean collars and a brand-new suit For the pass examination at the Institute, And that pass examination did so well for me, That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!   Of legal knowledge I acquired such a grip That they took me into the partnership. And that junior partnership, I ween, Was the only ship that I ever had seen. But that kind of ship so suited me, That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!   I grew so rich that I was sent By a pocket borough into Parliament. I always voted at my party's call, And I never thought of thinking for myself at all. I thought so little, they rewarded me By making me the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!    Now landsmen all, whoever you may be, If you want to rise to the top of the tree, If your soul isn't fettered to an office stool, Be careful to be guided by this golden rule-- Stick close to your desks and never go to sea, And you all may be rulers of the Queen's Navee!

I hope you treat your crew kindly, Captain Corcoran.  Indeed I hope so, Sir Joseph.  Never forget that they are the bulwarks of England's greatness, Captain Corcoran.  So I have always considered them, Sir Joseph.  No bullying, I trust--no strong language of any kind, eh?  Oh, never, Sir Joseph.  What, never?  Hardly ever, Sir Joseph. They are an excellent crew, and do their work thoroughly without it.  Don't patronise them, sir--pray, don't patronise them.  Certainly not, Sir Joseph.  That you are their captain is an accident of birth.I cannot permit these noble fellows to be patronised because an accident of birth has placed you above them and them below you.
EN012	1	Aw, goin' to school didn't do me no good. The teachers was all down on me. I couldn't learn nothin' there.  Nor any other place, I'm thinkin', you're that thick, Whisht! It's the doctor comin' down from Eileen. What'll he say, I wonder? Aw, Doctor, and how's Eileen now? Have you got her cured of the weakness?  Here are two prescriptions that'll have to be filled immediately.  You take them, Billy, and run round to the drug store.  Give me the money, then.  How much will they come to, Doctor?  About a dollar, I guess.  A dollar! Sure it's expensive medicines you're givin' her for a bit of a cold. Bring back the change--if there is any. And none of your tricks, for I'll stop at the drug store myself to-morrow and ask the man how much it was.  Aw, what do you think I am?  Take a chair, Doctor, and tell me what's wrong with Eileen.  Your daughter is very seriously ill.  Aw, Doctor, didn't I know you'd be sayin' that, anyway!  Your daughter has tuberculosis of the lungs.  Too-ber-c'losis?  Consumption, if that makes it plainer to you.  Consumption? Eileen? What lie is it you're tellin' me?  Look here, Carmody! I'm not here to stand for your insults!  Don't be angry, now, at what I said. Sure I'm out of my wits entirely. Eileen to have the consumption! Ah, Doctor, sure you must be mistaken!  There's no chance for a mistake, I'm sorry to say. Her right lung is badly affected.  It's a bad cold only, maybe.  Don't talk nonsense. She will have to go to a sanatorium at once. She ought to have been sent to one months ago. The girl's been keeping up on her nerve when she should have been in bed, and it's given the disease a chance to develop. It's a wonder to me you didn't see the condition she was in and force her to take care of herself. Why, the girl's nothing but skin and bone!$$$No--of course I ain't. Well, I'll tell you. I'm a governess, see? I take care of kids for people and learn them things.  A governess, is it? You must be smart, surely.  But let's not talk about me. Tell me about the wreck, like you promised me you would.  'Twas this way, Miss. Two weeks out we ran into the divil's own storm, and she sprang wan hell of a leak up for'ard. The skipper was hoping to make Boston before another blow would finish her, but ten days back we met up with another storm the like of the first, only worse. Four days we was in it with green seas raking over her from bow to stern. That was a terrible time, God help us. And if 'twasn't for me and my great strength, I'm telling you--and it's God's truth--there'd been mutiny itself in the stokehole. 'Twas me held them to it, with a kick to wan and a clout to another, and they not caring a damn for the engineers any more, but fearing a clout of my right arm more than they'd fear the sea itself.  You did some hard work, didn't you?  I did that! I'm a divil for sticking it out when them that's weak give up. But much good it did anyone! 'Twas a mad, fightin' scramble in the last seconds with each man for himself. I disremember how it come about, but there was the four of us in wan boat and when we was raised high on a great wave I took a look about and divil a sight there was of ship or men on top of the sea.  Then all the others was drowned?  BURKE--They was, surely.  What a terrible end!  A terrible end for the like of them swabs does live on land, maybe. But for the like of us does be roaming the seas, a good end, I'm telling you--quick and clane.  Yes, clean. That's yust the word for--all of it--the way it makes me feel.  The sea, you mean? I'm thinking you have a bit of it in your blood, too. Your Old Man wasn't only a barge rat--begging your pardon--all his life, by the cut of him.  No, he was bo'sun on sailing ships for years. And all the men on both sides of the family have gone to sea as far back as he remembers, he says. All the women have married sailors, too.  Did they, now? They had spirit in them. It's only on the sea you'd find rale men with guts is fit to wed with fine, high-tempered girls the like of yourself.
EN095	1	Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.  Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence. They're all so singularly kind and considerate. You don't find them wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying "It's my turn now." No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and never seem to grudge it.  It makes one feel quite selfish. It almost seems like taking advantage of their good nature.  How nice they were about the double rations.  Most considerate. Ah! there's only one thing wanting to make us thoroughly comfortable.  And that is?  The dear little wives we left behind us three months ago.  Yes, it is dull without female society. We can do without everything else, but we can't do without that.  And if we have that in perfection, we have everything. There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.    Take a pair of sparkling eyes, Hidden, ever and anon, In a merciful eclipse-- Do not heed their mild surprise-- Having passed the Rubicon, Take a pair of rosy lips; Take a figure trimly planned-- Such as admiration whets-- (Be particular in this); Take a tender little hand, Fringed with dainty fingerettes, Press it--in parenthesis;-- Ah! Take all these, you lucky man-- Take and keep them, if you can!  Take a pretty little cot-- Quite a miniature affair-- Hung about with trellised vine, Furnish it upon the spot With the treasures rich and rare I've endeavoured to define. Live to love and love to live-- You will ripen at your ease, Growing on the sunny side-- You're a dainty man to please If you are not satisfied. Ah! Take my counsel, happy man; Act upon it, if you can!  Here we are, at the risk of our lives, From ever so far, and we've brought your wives-- And to that end we've crossed the main, And don't intend to return again!$$$I am the last person to insult a British sailor, Sir Joseph.  You are the last person who did, Captain Corcoran. Desire that splendid seaman to step forward.   No, no, the other splendid seaman.  Ralph Rackstraw, three paces to the front--march!  If what?  I beg your pardon--I don't think I understand you.  If you please.  Oh, yes, of course. If you please.  You're a remarkably fine fellow.  Yes, your honour.  And a first-rate seaman, I'll be bound.  There's not a smarter topman in the Navy, your honour, though I say it who shouldn't.  Not at all. Proper self-respect, nothing more. Can you dance a hornpipe?  No, your honour.  That's a pity: all sailors should dance hornpipes. I will teach you one this evening, after dinner. Now tell me--don't be afraid-- how does your captain treat you, eh?  A better captain don't walk the deck, your honour.  Aye; Aye!  Good. I like to hear you speak well of your commanding officer; I daresay he don't deserve it, but still it does you credit. Can you sing?  I can hum a little, your honour.  Then hum this at your leisure. It is a song that I have composed for the use of the Royal Navy. It is designed to encourage independence of thought and action in the lower branches of the service, and to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man's equal, excepting mine. Now, Captain Corcoran, a word with you in your cabin, on a tender and sentimental subject.  Aye, aye,  Sir Joseph Boatswain, in commemoration of this joyous occasion, see that extra grog is served out to the ship's company at seven bells.  Beg pardon. If what, your honour?  If what? I don't think I understand you.  If you please, your honour.  What!  The gentleman is quite right. If you please.  If you please!

A trifle of a ring!  Oh, bother! I'm sure she's all right. And if she isn't, I don't care. She's been much too splendid.  Must think of the village. Didn't quite like the doctor's way of puttin' us off.  The poor darling owes his life to her.  H'm! Dash it! Yes! Can't forget the way she ran into that stinkin' pond.  Had she a wedding-ring on?  Well, I'm not going to be ungrateful.  It'd be dashed awkward--mustn't take a false step, Ella.  And I've got his braces!  Bertie!  That's all right, Rector--we're goin' to be perfectly polite, and--and--thank her, and all that.  We can see she's a good sort. What does it matter?  My dear Ella! "What does it matter!" We've got to know.  We do want light.  I'll ring the bell.  What did you ring for, Tommy?  God knows!  Somebody'll come.  Rector--you--you've got to----  Yes, Bertie.  Dear me!

Quite so--quite so! I shall hope it will turn out to be----Er--thank you--Ha!  Our dog has been fighting with the Rector's, and Mrs Challenger rescued him; she's bathing his ear. We're waiting to thank her. You needn't----  No.$$$I say; what's the matter? You were crying when I spoke to you.  Oh! nothing. The beautiful evening-that's all.  Cheer up!  Cheer up! You are not lonelee, like me.  I say, how did you how did you get into this? Isn't it an awfully hopeless sort of life?  Yees, it ees. You haf been wounded?  Just out of hospital to-day.  The horrible war--all the misery is because of the war. When will it end?  I say, what nationality are you?  Rooshian.  Really! I never met a Russian girl. I say, is it as bad as they make out?  Not when I haf anyone as ni-ice as you; I never haf had, though. You stopped because I was sad, others stop because I am gay. I am not fond of men at all. When you know--you are not fond of them.  Well, you hardly know them at their best, do you? You should see them in the trenches. By George! They're simply splendid--officers and men, every blessed soul. There's never been anything like it--just one long bit of jolly fine self-sacrifice; it's perfectly amazing.  I expect you are not the last at that. You see in them what you haf in yourself, I think.  Oh, not a bit; you're quite out! I assure you when we made the attack where I got wounded there wasn't a single man in my regiment who wasn't an absolute hero. The way they went in--never thinking of themselves--it was simply ripping.  It is the same too, perhaps, with--the enemy.  Oh, yes! I know that.  Ah! You are not a mean man. How I hate mean men!  Oh! they're not mean really--they simply don't understand.  Oh! You are a babee--a good babee aren't you?   But I li-ke you for it. It is so good to find a ni-ice man.  About being lonely? Haven't you any Russian friends?  Rooshian? No. The town is so beeg. Were you at the concert before you spoke to me?  Yes.  I too. I lofe music.  I suppose all Russians do.  I go there always when I haf the money.  What! Are you as badly on the rocks as that?
EN097	1	In short, if you'd kindle The spark of a swindle, Lure simpletons into your clutches-- Yes; into your clutches. Or hoodwink a debtor, You cannot do better  Than trot out a Duke or a Duchess--  A Duke or a Duchess!  Ah! Their Majesties. Your Majesty!  The Duke of Plaza-Toro, I believe?  The same. Allow me to present--  The young lady one of us married?  CAS. Gentlemen, I am the most obedient servant of one of you. Oh, Luiz!  I am now about to address myself to the gentleman whom my daughter married; the other may allow his attention to wander if he likes, for what I am about to say does not concern him. Sir, you will find in this young lady a combination of excellences which you would search for in vain in any young lady who had not the good fortune to be my daughter. There is some little doubt as to which of you is the gentleman I am addressing, and which is the gentleman who is allowing his attention to wander; but when that doubt is solved, I shall say , "Take her, and may she make you happier than her mother has made me."  Sir!  If possible. And now there is a little matter to which I think I am entitled to take exception. I come here in state with Her Grace the Duchess and Her Majesty my daughter, and what do I find? Do I find, for instance, a guard of honour to receive me? No!  No.  The town illuminated? No!  No.   Refreshment provided? No!  No.  A Royal salute fired? No!  No.  Triumphal arches erected? No!  No.  The bells set ringing?  No.  Yes--one--the Visitors', and I rang it myself. It is not enough! It is not enough!  Upon my honour, I'm very sorry; but you see, I was brought up in a gondola, and my ideas of politeness are confined to taking off my cap to my passengers when they tip me.  That's all very well in its way, but it is not enough.$$$And O my darling, O my pet, Whatever else you may forget, In yonder isle beyond the sea, Do not forget you've married me!  Oh my darling, O my pet, etc.   Then away we go to an island fair That lies in a Southern sea: We know not where, and we don't much care, Wherever that isle may be.  One, two, three, Haul! One, two, three, Haul! One, two, three, Haul! With a will!  When the breezes are a-blowing The ship will be going, When they don't we shall all stand still! Then away we go to an island fair, We know not where, and we don't much care, Wherever that isle may be.    Away we go To a balmy isle, Where the roses blow All the winter while.   Then away we go to an island fair That lies in a Southern sea: Then away we go to an island fair, Then away, then away, then away!  Of happiness the very pith In Barataria you may see: A monarchy that's tempered with Republican Equality. This form of government we find The beau ideal of its kind-- A despotism strict combined With absolute equality!  Two kings, of undue pride bereft, Who act in perfect unity, Whom you can order right and left With absolute impunity. Who put their subjects at their ease By doing all they can to please! And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese, Seize every opportunity.  Of happiness the very pith, etc.  Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good feeling--I say, we are much obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good feeling.  We heard you.  We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with sentiments so charmingly expressed.  That's all right.  At the same time there is just one little grievance that we should like to ventilate.  What?

I know how they did that. Matsy and me can show it to you.  And they had the Turnover Topsy Turvies, too.  They stood upside down on their heads.  My, my--but it must have been a wonderful show.

It's all in the way you feel about it.  Now, maw, you and Mrs. O'Toole take your seats out there in front.  I'll help you carry them out.  Now, we'll have to draw the curtain to get the stage ready.  And while we're getting ready Mary Ann can say her piece.  My, my, Kathleen, what a large crowd of people are here tonight. I'm afraid I'm not dressed up for the occasion.  Dressed up, is it? Indade you are. Ye have on short sleeves and a low-neck dress. What more would ye want? There's the minister and his wife setting right back there.

EN090	1	You are the first who has been kind to me for so long! I will tell you the truth--I am not Rooshian at all --I am German.  My dear girl, who cares. We aren't fighting against women.  Another man said that to me. But he was thinkin' of his fun. You are a veree ni-ice boy; I am so glad I met you. You see the good in people, don't you? That is the first thing in the world--because--there is really not much good in people, you know.  You are a dreadful little cynic! But of course you are!  Cyneec? How long do you think I would live if I was not a cyneec? I should drown myself to-morrow. Perhaps there are good people, but, you see, I don't know them.  I know lots.  Well now--see, ni-ice boy--you haf never been in a hole, haf you?  I suppose not a real hole.  No, I should think not, with your face. Well, suppose I am still a good girl, as I was once, you know; and you took me to your mother and your sisters and you said: "Here is a little German girl that has no work, and no money, and no friends." They will say: "Oh! how sad! A German girl!" And they will go and wash their hands.  You see.  I'm sure there are people.  No. They would not take a German, even if she was good. Besides, I don't want to be good any more--I am not a humbug; I have learned to be bad. Aren't you going to kees me, ni-ice boy?   Don't. I'd rather not, if you don't mind. It's stupid. I don't know--but you see, out there, and in hospital, life's different. It's--it's--it isn't mean, you know. Don't come too close.  Oh! You are fun--- Doesn't it light. No Zeps to-night. When they burn--what a 'orrble death! And all the people cheer. It is natural. Do you hate us veree much?$$$God! What beauty!  Umm?  I said: God! What beauty!  Aha!  Do you know that I have to repeat everything to you nowadays?  What?  That I have to repeat----  Yes; I heard. I'm sorry. I get absorbed.  In all but me.  My dear, your song was helping me like anything to get the mood. This paper is the very deuce--to balance between the historical and the natural.  Who wants the natural?  Umm! Wish I thought that! Modern taste! History may go hang; they're all for tuppence-coloured sentiment nowadays.  Is the Spring sentiment?  I beg your pardon, my dear; I didn't catch.  Beauty, beauty!  That's what I'm, trying to say here. The Orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty! Dash it! I get so sleepy; I wish you'd tell them to make the after-dinner coffee twice as strong.  I will.  How does this strike you? "Many Renaissance pictures, especially those of Botticelli, Francesca and Piero di Cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of Orpheus, and we owe a tiny gem--like Raphael 'Apollo and Marsyas' to the same Pagan inspiration."  We owe it more than that--rebellion against the dry-as-dust.  Quite. I might develop that: "We owe it our revolt against the academic; or our disgust at 'big business,' and all the grossness of commercial success. We owe----".  It--love.  PROF. [Abstracted] Eh!  I said: We owe it love.  Possibly. But--er I mustn't say that here--hardly!  Orpheus with his lute!  Most people think a lute is a sort of flute. My dear, if you're not going to sing again, d'you mind sitting down? I want to concentrate.  I'm going out.  Mind the dew!  The Christian virtues and the dew.  Not bad! Not bad! The Christian virtues and the dew. "How far we can trace the modern resurgence against the Christian virtues to the symbolic figures of Orpheus, Pan, Apollo, and Bacchus might be difficult to estimate, but----"   She'll get her throat bad. Sounds queer at night-H'm!   What's that girl's name?  Vanessa Hellgrove.  Aha!
EN093	0	Anna! It ain't so--  But one thing I never wrote you. It was one of them cousins that you think is such nice people--the youngest son--Paul--that started me wrong. It wasn't none of my fault. I hated him worse 'n hell and he knew it. But he was big and strong----like you!  God blarst it!   Anna!  That was why I run away from the farm. That was what made me get a yob as nurse girl in St. Paul. And you think that was a nice yob for a girl, too, don't you? With all them nice inland fellers yust looking for a chance to marry me, I s'pose. Marry me? What a chance! They wasn't looking for marrying. [I'm owning up to everything fair and square. I was caged in, I tell you--yust like in yail--taking care of other people's kids--listening to 'em bawling and crying day and night--when I wanted to be out--and I was lonesome--lonesome as hell! So I give up finally. What was the use? You don't say nothing--either of you--but I know what you're thinking. You're like all the rest! And who's to blame for it, me or you? If you'd even acted like a man--if you'd even been a regular father and had me with you--maybe things would be different!  Don't talk dat vay, Anna! Ay go crazy! Ay von't listen!  You will too listen! You--keeping me safe inland--I wasn't no nurse girl the last two years--I lied when I wrote you--I was in a house, that's what!--yes, that kind of a house--the kind sailors like you and Mat goes to in port--and your nice inland men, too--and all men, God damn 'em! I hate 'em! Hate 'em!  Anna! Anna! It's lie! It's lie!  So that's what's in it!  I s'pose you remember your promise, Mat? No other reason was to count with you so long as I wasn't married already. So I s'pose you want me to get dressed and go ashore, don't you? Yes, you do!$$$Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year. And we'll be marching on Christmas.  Nora got a picture-book, Melissa got a rake, Every Mulligan on deck got oranges and cake, Got a bag of candy, too--and got the stomachache, But we'll be marching on Christmas.  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here, Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year. And we'll be marching on Christmas.  And did ye have a good time at the entertainment?  Indade and we did that. It was as good as a circus parade and a picture show together. They treated us just lovely.  Did they now? And you wasn't invited at all, at all.  They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.  Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.  I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have some of the Christmas present, too.  That's just like your father, Micky.  And did ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?  Scwumptious, just scwumptious.  And me sash niver busted in two at all. And I was one of the most stylish young ladies present, so I was.  And they had a great, big Christmas tree. Clean up to the ceiling. With lights and toys and candy and little stars and bright fairies and angels and everything.  And ould Santy Claus was there with a long white beard and a big pack of presents to everyone.  And I pulled Santa Claus' whiskers and they nearly fell off. He must be getting pretty old, 'cause his whiskers is coming loose.  And Santy Claus called out all the names and everybody got up when their names was called and he gave 'em a present.  And they never called our names at all, at all.
EN092	1	Oh, ho, me fine young lady. I suppose yeez want a peek-a-boo dress all trimmed with mayonnaise ruffles down the bias, do you? It's lucky for you I found that tidy in the wash, so it is. And don't yeez eat too much or breathe hard or ye'll bust it, and then where'll you be at?  Maw, Mary Ann's chewing her apron.  Mary Ann Mulligan, take that apron out'n your mouth. I niver saw such a girl to be always chewing something. It's first yer dress and then yer apron or your petticoat, whatever happens to be your topmost garment. Clothes were not made to chew.   Here they are, maw, all ready for the party.  Are ye sure they're all clean?  I am that. They've been scrubbed until me two arms ache. And Micky's had a bath in the rain-barrel.  I have that, and I don't want another one, either.  All yeez sit down and let me look ye over.  Have ye finished the washing, maw?  For the prisint, yes. I have more important duties to perform. Now, first and foremost, don't walk pigeon-toed. Bridget, have ye got a clane handkerchief?  Yis, mum.  Well, don't forget to use it if the necessity arises, and you'd better set next to Peter Pan so's he can use it, too. He's been kinder nosey all day, and I shouldn't wonder if he wasn't coming down with a cold in his head. How do you feel, Peter Pan?  Scwumptious.  Micky Machree Mulligan, and what are yeez looking cross-eyed for? Do ye think it improves yer beauty?  I thought there was a speck of dirt on me nose.  Well, there's not, and hold yer head up straight.  Maw, ain't it most time to go?  It lacks two hours yet of the time, and Matsy ain't come back with the goat. Whatever's become of Shamus O'Brien I'd like to know. Which of yeez seen him last?  I saw him this mornin'. He was eatin' a tin tomato can down in the alley.  The poor thing! Now I suppose I'll have a sick goat on me hands on top of all me other troubles--and tomorrow's Christmas Day.$$$Of course I'm sure. It was awful big. The biggest fish I ever saw. Even in Russia we do not have such big fish as whales. Paddy Mike saw it, too.  Sure and I did. And me two eyes nearly fell out of me head with lookin' at it, it was that wonderful. He shot a big stream of water right up out of his head, he did, and then he dived down in the ocean again, and we didn't see him any more at all, at all.  There! Now if you get to see the great big whale, that's almost as good as having old Saint Nicholas come, ain't it?  Whales can't bring you no Christmas presents, can they, Klinker?  Und whales you can see any time. I'd rather have Saint Nicholas, wouldn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Who is this Saint Nicholas they are looking for, Hulda?  Why, don't you know who he is yet? He's the best old man that ever was. Und he comes the night before Christmas und visits all the little children in Holland.  Und in Germany, too.  Und if they're good they get candy und oranges und toys und things, don't they, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Und if they're bad, they get a good big birch stick. But I ain't been bad. I've been awfully good, isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. Und me also.  On Christmas Eve in Holland all the children march around the streets, following one who carries a big silver star. And the people who meet us give us money and gifts to help the poor. Oh, Christmas time is just grand in Holland!  Und we set out our leedle wooden shoes und old Saint Nicholas fills 'em with candy.

Think all the other bad about me you want to, and I won't kick, 'cause you've a right to. But don't think that! I couldn't bear it! It'd be yust too much to know you was going away where I'd never see you again--thinking that about me!  If I was believing--that you'd never had love for any other man in the world but me--I could be forgetting the rest, maybe.  Mat!  If 'tis truth you're after telling, I'd have a right, maybe, to believe you'd changed--and that I'd changed you myself 'til the thing you'd been all your life wouldn't be you any more at all.  Oh, Mat! That's what I been trying to tell you all along!  For I've a power of strength in me to lead men the way I want, and women, too, maybe, and I'm thinking I'd change you to a new woman entirely, so I'd never know, or you either, what kind of woman you'd been in the past at all.  Yes, you could, Mat! I know you could!  And I'm thinking 'twasn't your fault, maybe, but having that old ape for a father that left you to grow up alone, made you what you was. And if I could be believing 'tis only me you--  You got to believe it. Mat! What can I do? I'll do anything, anything you want to prove I'm not lying!  Would you be willing to swear an oath, now--a terrible, fearful oath would send your soul to the divils in hell if you was lying?  Sure, I'll swear, Mat--on anything!  Will you swear on this?  Yes. Sure I will. Give it to me.  'Tis a cross was given me by my mother, God rest her soul. I was a lad only, and she told me to keep it by me if I'd be waking or sleeping and never lose it, and it'd bring me luck. She died soon after. But I'm after keeping it with me from that day to this, and I'm telling you there's great power in it, and 'tis great bad luck it's saved me from and me roaming the seas, and I having it tied round my neck when my last ship sunk, and it bringing me safe to land when the others went to their death. And I'm warning you now, if you'd swear an oath on this, 'tis my old woman herself will be looking down from Hivin above, and praying Almighty God and the Saints to put a great curse on you if she'd hear you swearing a lie!$$$Of life, alas! his leave he's taking, For ah! his faithful heart is breaking; When he is gone we'll surely tell The maid that, as he died, he loved her well.

Yes, yes--ah, yes,--she loves you!   Oh joy, oh rapture unforeseen, For now the sky is all serene; The god of day--the orb of love-- Has hung his ensign high above, The sky is all ablaze.  With wooing words and loving song, We'll chase the lagging hours along, And if {I find } the maiden coy, we find I'll } murmur forth decorous joy We'll In dreamy roundelays!    He thinks he's won his Josephine, But though the sky is now serene, A frowning thunderbolt above May end their ill-assorted love Which now is all ablaze.  Our captain, ere the day is gone, Will be extremely down upon The wicked men who art employ To make his Josephine less coy In many various ways.  This very night,  With bated breath  And muffled oar--  Without a light,  As still as death,  We'll steal ashore  A clergyman  Shall make us one  At half-past ten,  And then we can  Return, for none  Can part them then!  This very night, etc.    Forbear, nor carry out the scheme you've planned; She is a lady--you a foremast hand! Remember, she's your gallant captain's daughter, And you the meanest slave that crawls the water!  Back, vermin, back, Nor mock us! Back, vermin, back, You shock us!   Let's give three cheers for the sailor's bride Who casts all thought of rank aside-- Who gives up home and fortune too For the honest love of a sailor true! For a British tar is a soaring soul As free as a mountain bird! His energetic fist should be ready to resist A dictatorial word! His foot should stamp and his throat should growl, His hair should twirl and his face should scowl, His eyes should flash and his breast protrude, And this should be his customary attitude--.
EN098	0	And if I get in my baby buggy, I'll bweak it all down.  And my mamma won't recognize me at all, 'cause I'm grown so big.  That's all very well, but it will be quite a job to make you all little again. It will take three magic fern seeds, and I don't think I have any ripe yet.  Oh, what is it, Mr. Wishing Man? Is it the fern seed?  Yes, but it's only one fern seed. Only one of you can be made little again.  Give it to my sister, Tootsy. She's a girl.  No, give it to Dumpling. He's the oldest.  I think I'll give it to 'ittie Snookie Ookums. Here, Snookums, take that little seed and go down by the pump and get a drink of water. Put the seed in the water and swallow it and you'll be the original 'ittie Snookums again.  Oh, goody, goody, goody!  Here's another fern seed. Ladies first, Dumpling. I'll give it to Tootsy.  Oh, you dear, good Wishing Man. I'll give you a nice hug and kiss for that. And here's the third magical fern seed. Here you are, Master Dumpling. Hurry along and grow little again.  Oh, thank you, sir.  The dolly plants don't seem to be doing very well. Here's a ripe one. I'm going to give that to for a Christmas present. And here's another for ----. I wonder how my big French dolls are doing. They're dreadfully hard to raise. They require so much attention. I have to keep them under cover to protect them from the sun. The wax melts so easily and the pretty red cheeks are apt to run down over their pretty French dresses. How nice they look. There's Annette, Olivette and Babette. Three as pretty little French ladies as ever came out of Paris. I think they're just about ready to pick. They're such pretty dollies that I think I'll give them to little boys instead of little girls. I'll give Annette to and I'll give Olivette to ----, and little Babette I'll give to ----.$$$There you go kiddin' again. But you was going to tell me about yourself. You're Irish, of course I can tell that.  Yes, thank God, though I've not seen a sight of it in fifteen years or more.  Sailors never do go home hardly, do they? That's what my father was saying.  He wasn't telling no lie. It's a hard and lonesome life, the sea is. The only women you'd meet in the ports of the world who'd be willing to speak you a kind word isn't woman at all. You know the kind I mane, and they're a poor, wicked lot, God forgive them. They're looking to steal the money from you only.  I think--I guess I'd better see what's doing inside.  Don't go, I'm saying! Is it I've given you offence with my talk of the like of them? Don't heed it at all! I'm clumsy in my wits when it comes to talking proper with a girl the like of you. And why wouldn't I be? Since the day I left home for to go to sea punching coal, this is the first time I've had a word with a rale, dacent woman. So don't turn your back on me now, and we beginning to be friends.  I'm not sore at you, honest.  God bless you!  But if you honestly think the sea's such a rotten life, why don't you get out of it?  Work on land, is it? Digging spuds in the muck from dawn to dark, I suppose? I wasn't made for it, Miss.  I thought you'd say that.  But there's good jobs and bad jobs at sea, like there'd be on land. I'm thinking if it's in the stokehole of a proper liner I was, I'd be able to have a little house and be home to it wan week out of four. And I'm thinking that maybe then I'd have the luck to find a fine dacent girl--the like of yourself, now--would be willing to wed with me.  Why, sure. Why not?  Then you think a girl the like of yourself might maybe not mind the past at all but only be seeing the good herself put in me?  Why, sure.  She'd not be sorry for it, I'd take my oath! 'Tis no more drinking and roving about I'd be doing then, but giving my pay day into her hand and staying at home with her as meek as a lamb each night of the week I'd be in port.

Tell her to get the hell out of it.  No. Ay don't like make her feel bad.  You're an old mush! Keep your girl away from the barge, then. She'll likely want to stay ashore anyway. What does she work at, your Anna?  She stay on dem cousins' farm 'till two year ago. Dan she gat yob nurse gel in St. Paul. But Ay don't vant for her gat yob now. Ay vant for her stay with me.  On a coal barge! She'll not like that, I'm thinkin'.  Don't I get that bucket o' suds, Dutchy?  Yes, Ay come, Marthy.  Now you're in for it! You'd better tell her straight to get out!  Py golly. Marthy--  Wha's that? I'm wise to what's in back of your nut, Dutchy. Yuh want to git rid o' me, huh?--now she's comin'. Gimme the bum's rush ashore, huh? Lemme tell yuh, Dutchy, there ain't a square-head workin' on a boat man enough to git away with that. Don't start nothin' yuh can't finish!  Ay don't start nutting, Marthy.  Ho-ho! Yuh're a scream, Square-head--an honest-ter-Gawd knockout! Ho-ho!  Ay don't see nutting for laugh at.  Take a slant in the mirror and yuh'll see. Ho-ho! A square-head tryin' to kid Marthy Owen at this late day!--after me campin' with barge men the last twenty years. I'm wise to the game, up, down, and sideways. I ain't been born and dragged up on the water front for nothin'. Think I'd make trouble, huh? Not me! I'll pack up me duds an' beat it. I'm quittin' yuh, get me? I'm tellin' yuh I'm sick of stickin' with yuh, and I'm leavin' yuh flat, see? There's plenty of other guys on other barges waitin' for me. Always was, I always found. So cheer up, Dutchy! I'll be offen the barge before she comes. You'll be rid o' me for good--and me o' you--good riddance for both of us. Ho-ho!$$$Things are seldom what they seem, Skim milk masquerades as cream; Highlows pass as patent leathers; Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.  Very true, So they do. Black sheep dwell in every fold; All that glitters is not gold; Storks turn out to be but logs; Bulls are but inflated frogs.  So they be, Frequentlee.  Drops the wind and stops the mill; Turbot is ambitious brill; Gild the farthing if you will, Yet it is a farthing still.  Yes, I know. That is so. Though to catch your drift I'm striving, It is shady--it is shady; I don't see at what you're driving, Mystic lady--mystic lady. Stern conviction's o'er me stealing, That the mystic lady's dealing In oracular revealing.  Stern conviction's o'er him stealing, That the mystic lady's dealing In oracular revealing. Yes, I know-- That is so!   Though I'm anything but clever, I could talk like that for ever: Once a cat was killed by care; Only brave deserve the fair. Very true, So they do.  Wink is often good as nod; Spoils the child who spares the rod; Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers; Dogs are found in many mangers.  Frequentlee,
EN069	1	I can't, Annie.  Why can't you?  A woman couldn't rightly understand my reason.  Because it's a stubborn reason. Oh, I heard you talking with the second mate. You're afraid the other captains will sneer at you because you didn't come back with a full ship. You want to live up to your silly reputation even if you do have to beat and starve men and drive me mad to do it.  It ain't that, Annie. Them skippers would never dare sneer to my face. It ain't so much what any one'd say--but--you see--I've always done it--since my first voyage as skipper. I always come back--with a full ship--and--it don't seem right not to--somehow. I been always first whalin' skipper out o' Homeport, and--don't you see my meanin', Annie? Annie! Best turn in, Annie, there's a good woman. You ain't well.  David! Won't you please turn back?  I can't, Annie--not yet awhile. You don't see my meanin'. I got to git the ile.  It'd be different if you needed the money, but you don't. You've got more than plenty.  It ain't the money I'm thinkin' of. D'you think I'm as mean as that?  No--I don't know--I can't understand. Oh, I want to be home in the old house once more, and see my own kitchen again, and hear a woman's voice talking to me and be able to talk to her. Two years! It seems so long ago--as if I'd been dead and could never go back.  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't well.  I used to be lonely when you were away. I used to think Homeport was a stupid, monotonous place. Then I used to go down on the beach, especially when it was windy and the breakers were rolling in, and I'd dream of the fine, free life you must be leading. I used to love the sea then. But now--I don't ever want to see the sea again.  'Tis no fit place for a woman, that's sure. I was a fool to bring ye.  How long would it take us to reach home--if we started now?  'Bout two months, I reckon, Annie, with fair luck.  That would be August, the latter part of August, wouldn't it? It was on the twenty-fifth of August we were married, David, wasn't it?  Don't you remember?  My memory is leaving me--up here in the ice. It was so long ago. It's June now. The lilacs will be all in bloom in the front yard--and the climbing roses on the trellis to the side of the house--they're budding--  Go in and rest, Annie. You're all worn out cryin' over what can't be helped.  You love me, don't you, David?  Love you? Why d'you ask me such a question, Annie?  But you do, don't you, David? Tell me!  I'm your husband, Annie, and you're my wife. Could there be aught but love between us after all these years?  Then you do love me. Say it!  I do, Annie.  I sometimes think if we could only have had a child--And I've always been a good wife to you, haven't I, David?  No man has ever had a better, Annie.  And I've never asked for much from you, have I, David? Have I?  You know you could have all I got the power to give ye, Annie.  Then do this, this once, for my sake, for God's sake--take me home! It's killing me, this life--the brutality and cold and horror of it. I'm going mad. I can feel the threat in the air. I can't bear the silence threatening me--day after gray day and every day the same. I can't bear it. I'll go mad, I know I will. Take me home, David, if you love me as you say. I'm afraid. For the love of God, take me home!$$$Mush! Indade and I will ask your pardon a thousand times--and on my knees, if ye like. I didn't mean a word of what I said or did. But divil a woman in all the ports of the world has iver made a great fool of me that way before!  I see. You mean you're a lady-killer and they all fall for you.  Leave off your fooling! 'Tis that is after getting my back up at you. 'Tis no lie I'm telling you about the women. Though it's a great jackass I am to be mistaking you, even in anger, for the like of them cows on the waterfront is the only women I've met up with since I was growed to a man. I'm a hard, rough man and I'm not fit, I'm thinking, to be kissing the shoe-soles of a fine, dacent girl the like of yourself. 'Tis only the ignorance of your kind made me see you wrong. So you'll forgive me, for the love of God, and let us be friends from this out. I'm thinking I'd rather be friends with you than have my wish for anything else in the world.  Sure.  God bless you!  Ouch!  Your pardon, Miss. 'Tis a clumsy ape I am. It's great power I have in my hand and arm, and I do be forgetting it at times.  Gee, you're some strong, all right.  It's no lie, and why shouldn't I be, with me shoveling a million tons of coal in the stokeholes of ships since I was a lad only. Let you sit down, now, Miss, and I'll be telling you a bit of myself, and you'll be telling me a bit of yourself, and in an hour we'll be as old friends as if we was born in the same house. Sit down now, if you plaze.  Well--But we won't talk about me, see? You tell me about yourself and about the wreck.  I'll tell you, surely. But can I be asking you one question. Miss, has my head in a puzzle?  Well--I dunno--what is it?  What is it you do when you're not taking a trip with the Old Man? For I'm thinking a fine girl the like of you ain't living always on this tub.
EN060	0	Sullen night is laughing day-- All the year is merry May!  And now our lives are going to begin in real earnest! What's a bachelor? A mere nothing--he's a chrysalis. He can't be said to live--he exists.  What a delightful institution marriage is! Why have we wasted all this time? Why didn't we marry ten years ago?  Because you couldn't find anybody nice enough.  Because you were waiting for us.  I suppose that was the reason. We were waiting for you without knowing it. Hallo!  Good morning.  If this gentleman is an undertaker it's a bad omen.  Ceremony of some sort going on?  He is an undertaker! No--a little unimportant family gathering. Nothing in your line.  Somebody's birthday, I suppose?  Yes, mine!  And mine!  And mine!  And mine!  Curious coincidence! And how old may you all be?  It's a rude question--but about ten minutes. Remarkably fine children! But surely you are jesting?  In other words, we were married about ten minutes since.  Married! You don't mean to say you are married?  Oh yes, we are married.  What, both of you?  All four of us.  Bless my heart, how extremely awkward!  You don't mind, I suppose?  You were not thinking of either of us for yourself, I presume? Oh, Giuseppe, look at him--he was. He's heart-broken!  No, no, I wasn't! I wasn't!  Now, my man we don't want anything in your line to-day, and if your curiosity's satisfied--you can go!  You mustn't call me your man. It's a liberty. I don't think you know who I am.  Not we, indeed! We are jolly gondoliers, the sons of Baptisto Palmieri, who led the last revolution. Republicans, heart and soul, we hold all men to be equal. As we abhor oppression, we abhor kings: as we detest vain-glory, we detest rank: as we despise effeminacy, we despise wealth. We are Venetian gondoliers--your equals in everything except our calling, and in that at once your masters and your servants.$$$Oh, give me a nice little home, And plenty of suds in me tub, And I will be happy all day, With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub.  The queen on her golden throne, Will envy me here at me tub, For no one's as jolly as I, With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub.  Sure, what would I do at a dance? Or what would I do at a club? But here in me kitchen I'm queen With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub.  Oh, give me a nice little home, And plenty of suds in me tub, And I will be happy all day, With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub!  Maw, don't you think it's most time fer us to be going?  Time to be going, is it? Well, I should hope not. Sure, half of the children are not dry yet, and the other half are not dressed. Bridget Honora, darlin', look in the other room and see how they're coming on.  I think we ought to be there early, so as we can get a good seat on the front row. I don't want to miss nothing.  True for you, Matsy, and I don't want yeez to be missing anything either. It ain't like as if yeez go to a fine Christmas entertainment ivery night of yer lives.  It's the first one any of us ever went to at all, at all. Do yeez think they be after having moving pictures?  Of course not. Not in a Sunday School, Matsy. But belike they'll have a fine, grand Christmas tree with singin' and spaches and fine costumes and prisints for every one. Bridget Honora!  Yes, maw?  Come here.  Melissa and Micky Machree have been scrubbed until they shine. They're sitting in the window drying in the sun. Mary Ann is cleaning Peter Pan in the lard bucket, and Patsy is washing Teddy Magee in the rain-barrel. Nora is curling Clarissa's hair with the poker, and somebody's untied the goat.  Untied the goat, is it? Matsy Mulligan, put on yer hat at once and see what's become of Shamus O'Brien. He's a good goat, is Shamus, but he's like the late Mr. Mulligan, he has a rovin' disposition and a tremenjous appetite. Hurry now, Matsy.
EN061	0	Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.  Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence. They're all so singularly kind and considerate. You don't find them wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying "It's my turn now." No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and never seem to grudge it.  It makes one feel quite selfish. It almost seems like taking advantage of their good nature.  How nice they were about the double rations.  Most considerate. Ah! there's only one thing wanting to make us thoroughly comfortable.  And that is?  The dear little wives we left behind us three months ago.  Yes, it is dull without female society. We can do without everything else, but we can't do without that.  And if we have that in perfection, we have everything. There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.    Take a pair of sparkling eyes, Hidden, ever and anon, In a merciful eclipse-- Do not heed their mild surprise-- Having passed the Rubicon, Take a pair of rosy lips; Take a figure trimly planned-- Such as admiration whets-- (Be particular in this); Take a tender little hand, Fringed with dainty fingerettes, Press it--in parenthesis;-- Ah! Take all these, you lucky man-- Take and keep them, if you can!  Take a pretty little cot-- Quite a miniature affair-- Hung about with trellised vine, Furnish it upon the spot With the treasures rich and rare I've endeavoured to define. Live to love and love to live-- You will ripen at your ease, Growing on the sunny side-- You're a dainty man to please If you are not satisfied. Ah! Take my counsel, happy man; Act upon it, if you can!  Here we are, at the risk of our lives, From ever so far, and we've brought your wives-- And to that end we've crossed the main, And don't intend to return again!$$$Methought I heard a whir of wings on high.   I see naught save the snow and starry sky.   We've come a long and mighty step today, From o'er the frosty hills and far away.  Look, father, dost thou see that shining star That seems to stand above the town so far? 'Tis like a wondrous blossom on a stem, And see, it ever shines o'er Bethlehem!   A brighter star, I'm sure I never saw-- And perfect form, without a speck or flaw.   A stranger star! It never shone before, It standeth still above that stable door.  Look ye, I've found a little lamb new-born.  Poor little beastie! Wrap him well and warm.  An ill night to be born in, frost and snow, Naught but cold skies above, cold earth below. I marvel any little creature should be born On such a night.   I found it all forlorn, Crying beside its mother in the storm.  Hark, I thought I heard a sound of mighty wings! Listen! Is it the winter sky that sings?  Nay, gran'ther, I heard naught. You're old and gray And weary with the miles you've walked today.   At noon I met a man who tarried in the shade, He led a mule, and riding it a maid-- A maiden with a face I'll ne'er forget, A wondrous face, I seem to see it yet Lit with an inward shining, as if God Had set a lighted lamp within her soul. Many have passed all day, but none like these, And no face have I ever seen like hers.   Belike the man and maid were strangers here, And come to Bethlehem at the king's command.   Methinks I met that very man and maid-- A maiden with such wondrous dove-like eyes, I saw them near this place, all tired and worn, Trudging about the town, seeking an inn.   And did they find one?   Nay, not so!  For every inn was crowded to its doors. Hard by Deborah's inn there is a little barn, All full of cattle, oxen, cooing doves-- I showed it to them, and they went therein.   Mother, that star! That wondrous, wondrous light,

Now, you 'phone up Miggs, and get right along with it. I've only one rule, sir! Give the Public what it wants; and what the Public wants is punch and go. They've got no use for Beauty, Allegory, all that high-brow racket. I know 'em as I know my hand.  Mr Frost, the Public would take this, I'm sure they would; I'm convinced of it. You underrate them.  Now, see here, Mr Blewitt Vane, is this my theatre? I tell you, I can't afford luxuries.  But it--it moved you, sir; I saw it. I was watching.  Mr Vane, I judge I'm not the average man.

Well, here I am--got me pass to heaven. No more fightin', no more drillin', no more sleepin' rough. We can get married now, Daisy. We can live soft an' 'appy. Give us a kiss, my dear.  No.  Why not?  That's why, soldier.  'Oo are you, Pompey? The sun don't shine in your inside, do it? 'Oo is he, Daisy?  I'll fight you for her.  Mate, you done your bit, an' I done mine.

Oh, he'll do what he says, don't worry! You'll make a mistake if you think he's bluffing. It'd probably get in all the papers about you refusing. Every one would be down on you. You might even lose your job over it, people would be so sore.  Ah, divil take him! Let him send her where he wants, then. I'll not be sayin' a word.  And, honestly, Mr. Carmody, I don't see how you can object for a second--after he's told you it's absolutely necessary for Eileen to go away.

But you're right. Let her do what she's wishful to, _and_ get well soon.  That's the right spirit. I knew you'd see it that way. And you and I'll do all we can to help her. Well, I guess I'll have to go. Tell Eileen----  You're not goin'? Sure, Eileen is puttin' on her clothes to come down and have a look at you. She'll be here in a jiffy. Sit down now, and wait for her.  No--no--I can't stay--I only came for a moment--I've got an appointment--honestly. Besides, it isn't right for her to be up. She's too weak. It'll make her worse. You should have told her.  Good evening, Fred.  Hello, Eileen. I'm so sorry to---- You must sit down. You've got to take care of yourself. You never ought to have got up to-night.
EN064	1	Aw, now, maw, I can't go and hunt the goat. I'm all dressed up for the entertainment. If I go after the goat, sure it's all mussed up I'll be.  Yis, if I swat you one wid this wet cloth, it's worse than mussed up you'll be. Hurry after the goat. Niver a step does any Mulligan take from this house tonight until Shamus O'Brien is safe in the kitchen, wid his horns tied to the wash boiler.  Sure, I dunno where to look fer him.  Go over to Mrs. O'Toole's cabbage garden; like as not ye'll find him there. Sure, Shamus has a fine appetite for cabbages.  Don't let 'em start afore I get back. I don't want to miss nothin'.  Now, Bridget Honora, lave off hanging up the clothes and go in and see if Melissa and Micky Machree are dry yet. And if they are call me in and I'll attend to their costumes.  Maw, Mary Ann's having an awful time. She's growed so that her skirt and her waist has parted company, and what she'll be after doing I don't know at all, at all.  Is there anything she can use as a sash?  No'm. Nora and Clarissa have used up all the sashes.  Look here, now, Bridget Honora, see what I've found in the wash. It's a tidy to go on top of a dresser, but I'm thinking it's just the thing to fill the gap between the skirt and the waist of Mary Ann.  Yes, maw.  Oh, maw, maw, come quick! Hurry, or he'll be drowned.  What is it, Patsy? Spake quick.  It's Teddy Magee. I was givin' him a wash in the rain-barrel, when all of a sudden, bad luck to him, he slipped through me fingers and fell head-first down in the barrel. Oh, it's drownded dead he'll be. Oh, oh!  Oh, me baby, me baby!$$$A Christmas tree. A look at old Santa Claus. Some nice Christmas presents, etc.  Stop, stop. I can't attend to so many wishes at once.  Please, Mr. Wishing Man, couldn't you tell us what we'd better wish for?  Have you ever had a great, big Christmas tree?  Oh, yes, lots of times.  Have you ever seen my old friend, Mr. Santa Claus?  Oh, yes.  We see him every year at Christmas.  How would like to go with me to Wishing Land.  Oh, goody! That would be fine. Can you take us there?  Of course I can. And that's just what we'll do. We'll all of us go to the Wishing Land. First, I'll call little Dumpling. Dumpling, little Dumpling, where are you?  Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. I was playing with my little horse and wagon.  And how do you like being a great, big Dumpling?  Well, not very well. I'm always bumping my head on the doors and things. And all my toys are so very little I'm always breaking them.  Where is your sister? Where is little Tootsy?  Here, Mr. Wishing Man. I'm here. Me and my little dolly.  Well, little Tootsy, how do you like being a great, big Tootsy?  I don't like it very well. My clothes don't seem to fit, and I know I look awfully funny. Don't I? Everybody laughs at me and it always makes me cry.  And where is little Snookie Ookums?  Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. Here's 'ittie Snookie Ookums.  You look like a 'ittie baby elephant, Snookie Ookums. Well, are you children satisfied with your wish?  Not very much. We wish we were little again.  I tried to ride my little horsie and I bweaked him all to pieces.  And I can't get enough to eat. My little knife and fork and spoon are too little, and when I eat I swallow dishes and all.  And all my clothes are too little for me, and I look so funny that everybody laughs at me. And I don't like it at all.
EN065	1	I can't, Annie.  Why can't you?  A woman couldn't rightly understand my reason.  Because it's a stubborn reason. Oh, I heard you talking with the second mate. You're afraid the other captains will sneer at you because you didn't come back with a full ship. You want to live up to your silly reputation even if you do have to beat and starve men and drive me mad to do it.  It ain't that, Annie. Them skippers would never dare sneer to my face. It ain't so much what any one'd say--but--you see--I've always done it--since my first voyage as skipper. I always come back--with a full ship--and--it don't seem right not to--somehow. I been always first whalin' skipper out o' Homeport, and--don't you see my meanin', Annie? Annie! Best turn in, Annie, there's a good woman. You ain't well.  David! Won't you please turn back?  I can't, Annie--not yet awhile. You don't see my meanin'. I got to git the ile.  It'd be different if you needed the money, but you don't. You've got more than plenty.  It ain't the money I'm thinkin' of. D'you think I'm as mean as that?  No--I don't know--I can't understand. Oh, I want to be home in the old house once more, and see my own kitchen again, and hear a woman's voice talking to me and be able to talk to her. Two years! It seems so long ago--as if I'd been dead and could never go back.  Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't well.  I used to be lonely when you were away. I used to think Homeport was a stupid, monotonous place. Then I used to go down on the beach, especially when it was windy and the breakers were rolling in, and I'd dream of the fine, free life you must be leading. I used to love the sea then. But now--I don't ever want to see the sea again.  'Tis no fit place for a woman, that's sure. I was a fool to bring ye.  How long would it take us to reach home--if we started now?  'Bout two months, I reckon, Annie, with fair luck.  That would be August, the latter part of August, wouldn't it? It was on the twenty-fifth of August we were married, David, wasn't it?  Don't you remember?  My memory is leaving me--up here in the ice. It was so long ago. It's June now. The lilacs will be all in bloom in the front yard--and the climbing roses on the trellis to the side of the house--they're budding--  Go in and rest, Annie. You're all worn out cryin' over what can't be helped.  You love me, don't you, David?  Love you? Why d'you ask me such a question, Annie?  But you do, don't you, David? Tell me!  I'm your husband, Annie, and you're my wife. Could there be aught but love between us after all these years?  Then you do love me. Say it!  I do, Annie.  I sometimes think if we could only have had a child--And I've always been a good wife to you, haven't I, David?  No man has ever had a better, Annie.  And I've never asked for much from you, have I, David? Have I?  You know you could have all I got the power to give ye, Annie.  Then do this, this once, for my sake, for God's sake--take me home! It's killing me, this life--the brutality and cold and horror of it. I'm going mad. I can feel the threat in the air. I can't bear the silence threatening me--day after gray day and every day the same. I can't bear it. I'll go mad, I know I will. Take me home, David, if you love me as you say. I'm afraid. For the love of God, take me home!$$$You mutt, you! I've stood enough from you. Don't you dare. Love 'em! Oh, my Gawd! You damn thick-head! Love 'em? I hated 'em, I tell you! Hated 'em, hated 'em, hated 'em! And may Gawd strike me dead this minute and my mother, too, if she was alive, if I ain't telling you the honest truth!  If I could only be believing you now!  Oh, what's the use? What's the use of me talking? What's the use of anything? Oh, Mat, you mustn't think that for a second! You mustn't! Think all the other bad about me you want to, and I won't kick, 'cause you've a right to. But don't think that! I couldn't bear it! It'd be yust too much to know you was going away where I'd never see you again--thinking that about me!  If I was believing--that you'd never had love for any other man in the world but me--I could be forgetting the rest, maybe.  Mat!  If 'tis truth you're after telling, I'd have a right, maybe, to believe you'd changed--and that I'd changed you myself 'til the thing you'd been all your life wouldn't be you any more at all.  Oh, Mat! That's what I been trying to tell you all along!  For I've a power of strength in me to lead men the way I want, and women, too, maybe, and I'm thinking I'd change you to a new woman entirely, so I'd never know, or you either, what kind of woman you'd been in the past at all.  Yes, you could, Mat! I know you could!  And I'm thinking 'twasn't your fault, maybe, but having that old ape for a father that left you to grow up alone, made you what you was. And if I could be believing 'tis only me you--  You got to believe it. Mat! What can I do? I'll do anything, anything you want to prove I'm not lying!  Would you be willing to swear an oath, now--a terrible, fearful oath would send your soul to the divils in hell if you was lying?  Sure, I'll swear, Mat--on anything!  Will you swear on this?  Yes. Sure I will. Give it to me.  'Tis a cross was given me by my mother, God rest her soul. I was a lad only, and she told me to keep it by me if I'd be waking or sleeping and never lose it, and it'd bring me luck. She died soon after. But I'm after keeping it with me from that day to this, and I'm telling you there's great power in it, and 'tis great bad luck it's saved me from and me roaming the seas, and I having it tied round my neck when my last ship sunk, and it bringing me safe to land when the others went to their death. And I'm warning you now, if you'd swear an oath on this, 'tis my old woman herself will be looking down from Hivin above, and praying Almighty God and the Saints to put a great curse on you if she'd hear you swearing a lie!
EN066	1	Fair moon, to thee I sing, Bright regent of the heavens, Say, why is everything Either at sixes or at sevens? I have lived hitherto Free from breath of slander, Beloved by all my crew-- A really popular commander. But now my kindly crew rebel, My daughter to a tar is partial, Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell, He threatens a court martial! Fair moon, to thee I sing, Bright regent of the heavens, Say, why is everything Either at sixes or at sevens?  How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the unconscious moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may be! Who is poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall on one so lowly! And yet if he knew--if he only knew!  Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board? That is not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable to have gone on shore at dusk.  True, dear Captain--but the recollection of your sad paleface seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile before I go.  Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon me, and all my old friends seem to have turned against me!  Oh no--do not say "all", dear Captain. That were unjust to one, at least.  True, for you are staunch to me. If ever I gave my heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this! (Aloud.) I am touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it is, I fear I can never be more to you than a friend.  I understand! You hold aloof from me because you are rich and lofty--and I poor and lowly. But take care! The poor bumboat woman has gipsy blood in her veins, and she can read destinies.  Destinies?  There is a change in store for you!  A change?  Aye--be prepared!$$$Don't be alarmed--it's not serious. It is arranged that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we are to act as one person.  Exactly.  Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point of fact, two persons.  Ah, I don't think we can go into that. It is a legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things. Situated as we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.  No; but you can recognize two independent appetites. It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it as a legal fiction carried a little too far.  It's rather a nice point. I don't like to express an opinion off-hand. Suppose we reserve it for argument before the full Court?  Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?  We want our tea.  I think we may make an interim order for double rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to indemnify in the event of an adverse decision?  That, I think, will meet the case. But you must work hard--stick to it--nothing like work.  Oh, certainly. We quite understand that a man who holds the magnificent position of King should do something to justify it. We are called "Your Majesty"; we are allowed to buy ourselves magnificent clothes; our subjects frequently nod to us in the streets; the sentries always return our salutes; and we enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists to all the principal charities. In return for these advantages the least we can do is to make ourselves useful about the Palace.   Rising early in the morning, We proceed to light the fire, Then our Majesty adorning In its workaday attire, We embark without delay On the duties of the day.  First, we polish off some batches Of political despatches, And foreign politicians circumvent; Then, if business isn't heavy, We may hold a Royal levee, Or ratify some Acts of Parliament. Then we probably review the household troops-- With the usual "Shalloo humps!" and "Shalloo hoops!" Or receive with ceremonial and state An interesting Eastern potentate.

But there our duty lies, the wind grows cold! Come, let's away and put the sheep in fold.   Nay, Simeon, wait! What means this crowd of men And women here in peaceful Bethlehem?   Herod the King hath issued a decree That each and all his subjects taxèd be; And every one who in this town saw light Must here return and register tonight. From all Judea, aye, from th' distant land, Each Bethlehemite must come at his command.   The town is full of people, great and small, Each inn is crowded to its very wall.   But come, we're wasting time, 'tis very late. Make haste, my son, I know the flocks await!   Thou speakest true, though I would rather stay, Our duty calls, so to the hills, away!  My inn is crowded to the doors. The heat Is stifling, but out here the air is sweet.    The bright stars twinkle with mysterious light, Methinks there's something strange about the night.  Some strange, unearthly voice seems calling me, Methinks this night portends great things to be.  Hail, hostess of the inn, my cousin here Hath lodgings at your inn. We'd seek its cheer.  Enter within. My guests tonight are gay And fain would turn this winter's night to day.  Oh, mother, hark! There's music in the inn!   'Tis not for us--their noise and merry din.   Our little town is crowded, joyous, gay.   So many travelers came this way today.   The night is chill and cold, I much do fear The little sheep will shiver by the mere.   Too cold it is for thee, I fear, in truth, Return and get thy cloak, my little Ruth. We'll wait for thee upon the little hill.

Grandpa said he'd get us anything we wished for.  What do you wish, Snookums?  Wish Grandpaw would come home.  I know a real good wish. I wish it were Christmas every day. Don't you, Dumpling?  No, I don't. We'd have to have a present and a tree and a turkey and plum pudding every day of our lives. We'd get awfully tired of it after a while. Just think, we'd have to give away about a million presents every year.  I'll tell you what I really do wish.  What?  I wish we could do just like grown up folks do. I wish I was the biggest little girl in all the world.  And I wish so, too. I wish we were just awfully, awfully, awfully big--and then we could go to Aunt Clara's dinner party, and everywhere.  Me wish me was great big Snookums.  But money couldn't buy that wish, Dumpling.  No, that's right. But Grandpa said if he couldn't buy our wish he'd get it some other way.  How could he get it?  He said he'd tell the Wishing Man.  My, I wonder if there really is such a person!  I don't know. But I'd like to see him if there is.  I'll make a rhyme.  Good Mr. Wishing Man, how do you do? If there is such a person, we'd like to see you!    If you come from afar, if you come from near, Good Mr. Wishing Man, appear, appear! Well?  Well? Well!  Well?  Well, I'm here.  Who's here?  Why, I am here. You said you would like to see me and so I have come. I'm here.  Are you the Wishing Man?  That's my name.  I'm the friend of all the children, And I'll help you if I can,

Mary Ann, don't let yer sash bust in two!   Ye have a fine family, Mrs. Mulligan. Ye have a fine bunch of boys, and ye have a bunch of girls, and ye have a fine bunch of babies; but ye have an awful goat.  Shamus O'Brien is the pest of me heart, Kathleen O'Toole; so he is; but he's all that's left of me late husband's property. Michael Mulligan thought the world of that goat, he did.  I'm a peaceful woman, Mollie Mulligan, and a calm, neighborly woman; but I don't like goats.  I don't blame ye at all, at all, Kathleen. But poor Shamus O'Brien was probably only nosing around fer a bit of Christmas Eve dinner. I'll kape him tied in the future.  Sure and it is Christmas Eve, isn't it?

Then we go and stand as sentry At the Palace (private entry), Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and fro, While the warrior on duty Goes in search of beer and beauty (And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go). He relieves us, if he's able, Just in time to lay the table, Then we dine and serve the coffee, and at half-past twelve or one, With a pleasure that's emphatic, We retire to our attic With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!

The fact is, that although I have urged my suit with as much eloquence as is consistent with an official utterance, I have done so hitherto without success. How do you account for this?  Really, Sir Joseph, I hardly know. Josephine is of course sensible of your condescension.  She naturally would be.  But perhaps your exalted rank dazzles her.  You think it does?  I can hardly say; but she is a modest girl, and her social position is far below your own. It may be that she feels she is not worthy of you.  That is really a very sensible suggestion, and displays more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit for.  See, she comes. If your lordship would kindly reason with her and assure her officially that it is a standing rule at the Admiralty that love levels all ranks, her respect for an official utterance might induce

And did ye have a good time at the entertainment?  Indade and we did that. It was as good as a circus parade and a picture show together. They treated us just lovely.  Did they now? And you wasn't invited at all, at all.  They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.  Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.  I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have some of the Christmas present, too.  That's just like your father, Micky.  And did ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?  Scwumptious, just scwumptious.  And me sash niver busted in two at all. And I was one of the most stylish young ladies present, so I was.  And they had a great, big Christmas tree. Clean up to the ceiling. With lights and toys and candy and little stars and bright fairies and angels and everything.  And ould Santy Claus was there with a long white beard and a big pack of presents to everyone.  And I pulled Santa Claus' whiskers and they nearly fell off. He must be getting pretty old, 'cause his whiskers is coming loose.  And Santy Claus called out all the names and everybody got up when their names was called and he gave 'em a present.  And they never called our names at all, at all.$$$Whoa, there, Jimmie! Oh, Grandpa, I do love my pony. It's the best of all my presents.  Well, it's time you put him in his stall.  I'm going to call my pony after Mr. ----. 'Cause he looks just like him.  And what are you going to call your pony, Snookums?  Going to call him Elizabeth, after you, Grandma.  That's my baby!  Grandma, we'd better get our hats and coats. It's nearly time for the car to be after us.  Come, Grandpa. It's nearly eight o'clock.  But I don't like to leave the children.  And we don't like to have you leave us, either. My, this has been the grandest Christmas day I've ever seen.  Come, Grandma.  Come, children. I'm glad you've had such a happy Christmas. You got everything you wanted, didn't you?  Yes, everything. My, I wish Christmas would come every day.  Tell us the story about old Saint Nick, Grandpa.  Do you want to hear that old chestnut again?  Oh, yes, yes!  Oh, that was just lovely.  I just wish I could see him. Just once!  And so do I. I'm going to catch him some Christmas Eve.  Me, too! Here, Grandpa, put on your coat and hat, or we'll be late for the dinner.  I'd rather stay here and talk to the children.  But Aunt Clara is expecting us.  And the auto is at the door.  Dumpling, are you sure you got everything you wanted for Christmas?  I can't think of anything else.  If you didn't, and if all three of you children can agree on anything else, it shall be yours if money can buy it.  Money can buy everything, can't it, Grandpa?  No, my dear, not quite everything.  But suppose we wish for something that money can't buy?  I'd try to get it for you some other way.
EN004	0	Sullen night is laughing day-- All the year is merry May!  And now our lives are going to begin in real earnest! What's a bachelor? A mere nothing--he's a chrysalis. He can't be said to live--he exists.  What a delightful institution marriage is! Why have we wasted all this time? Why didn't we marry ten years ago?  Because you couldn't find anybody nice enough.  Because you were waiting for us.  I suppose that was the reason. We were waiting for you without knowing it. Hallo!  Good morning.  If this gentleman is an undertaker it's a bad omen.  Ceremony of some sort going on?  He is an undertaker! No--a little unimportant family gathering. Nothing in your line.  Somebody's birthday, I suppose?  Yes, mine!  And mine!  And mine!  And mine!  Curious coincidence! And how old may you all be?  It's a rude question--but about ten minutes. Remarkably fine children! But surely you are jesting?  In other words, we were married about ten minutes since.  Married! You don't mean to say you are married?  Oh yes, we are married.  What, both of you?  All four of us.  Bless my heart, how extremely awkward!  You don't mind, I suppose?  You were not thinking of either of us for yourself, I presume? Oh, Giuseppe, look at him--he was. He's heart-broken!  No, no, I wasn't! I wasn't!  Now, my man we don't want anything in your line to-day, and if your curiosity's satisfied--you can go!  You mustn't call me your man. It's a liberty. I don't think you know who I am.  Not we, indeed! We are jolly gondoliers, the sons of Baptisto Palmieri, who led the last revolution. Republicans, heart and soul, we hold all men to be equal. As we abhor oppression, we abhor kings: as we detest vain-glory, we detest rank: as we despise effeminacy, we despise wealth. We are Venetian gondoliers--your equals in everything except our calling, and in that at once your masters and your servants.$$$It turns the night to day, it shines so bright I am afraid! It cannot be that any star, Only a star, can give so great a light. It frightens me.   All things are strange tonight. The very sheep are restless in their fold, They watch the star and do not mind the cold.  Again I heard a singing in the sky!   You heard the tinkling bell of some stray sheep, The night grows late, come let us all to sleep.    Yea, all ye lie down and take your rest, I'll keep the watch alone, this night is blest.   Here, take the little sheep and keep it warm.  Poor little new-born beast, I'll guard from harm. Again I marvel that you should be born On such a night, poor little lamb forlorn.   The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not want.  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.   Hark! There's music in the wind! And that strange light There in the east, it brightens all the night! I seem to hear again the whir of wings, Awake, awake! It is an angel sings!  Glory to God in the highest! Fear not! For behold I bring you glad tidings Of great joy. For unto you is born this day In the city of David, a Saviour
EN005	1	Gimme a shock. Number Two.  Same here.  Here's luck!  Give us another.  Gimme a scoop this time--lager and porter. I'm dry.  Same here.  Hello, boss.  Hello, Larry. Just on time.  Let's drink up and get back to it.  Addressed care of you, Johnny. Know him?  Christopher Christopherson.  Square-head name.  Old Chris--that's who.  Oh, sure. I was forgetting Chris carried a hell of a name like that. Letters come here for him sometimes before, I remember now. Long time ago, though.  It'll get him all right then?  Sure thing. He comes here whenever he's in port.  Sailor, eh?  Captain of a coal barge.  Some job! Well, s'long.  S'long. I'll see he gets it. You got good eyes, Larry. Where's it from?  St. Paul. That'll be in Minnesota, I'm thinkin'. Looks like a woman's writing, too, the old divil!  He's got a daughter somewheres out West, I think he told me once. Come to think of it, I ain't seen old Chris in a dog's age. Guess I'll be gettin' home. See you to-morrow.  Good-night to ye, boss.  Hello, Yohnny! Have drink on me. Come on, Larry. Give us drink. Have one yourself. Ay gat money--plenty money.  Speak of the devil. We was just talkin' about you.  Hello, Chris. Put it there.  Give us drink.  You got a half-snootful now. Where'd you get it?  Oder fallar on oder barge--Irish fallar--he gat bottle vhiskey and we drank it, yust us two. Dot vhiskey gat kick, by yingo! Ay yust come ashore. Give us drink, Larry. Ay vas little drunk, not much. Yust feel good. "My Yosephine, come board de ship. Long time Ay vait for you. De moon, she shi-i-i-ine. She looka yust like you. Tchee-tchee, tchee-tchee, tchee-tchee, tchee-tchee."  Same old Yosie, eh, Chris?  You don't know good song when you hear him. Italian fallar on oder barge, he learn me dat. Give us drink.  What's your pleasure, gentlemen?  Small beer, Larry.  Vhiskey--Number Two.  I'll take a cigar on you.  Skoal!  Drink hearty.  Have oder drink.  No. Some other time. Got to go home now. So you've just landed? Where are you in from this time?  Norfolk. Ve make slow voyage--dirty vedder--yust fog, fog, fog, all bloody time!  He's still got that same cow livin' with him, the old fool!  A sport, Chris is. Well, I'll beat it home. S'long.$$$Who'll it be? Ah, it's Fred Nicholls, maybe. Eileen's young man, Doctor, that she's engaged to marry, as you might say.  H'mm--yes--she spoke of him.  I had a mind to phone to your house, but I wasn't wishful to disturb you, knowin' you'd be comin' to call to-night.  It's nothing serious, I hope.  Ah, who knows? Here's the doctor. You've not met him?  I haven't had the pleasure. Of course, I've heard----  It's Doctor Gaynor. This is Fred Nicholls, Doctor. Sit down, Fred, that's a good lad, and be talkin' to the Doctor a moment while I go upstairs and see how is Eileen. She's all alone up there.  Certainly, Mr. Carmody. Go ahead--and tell her how sorry I am to learn she's under the weather.  I will so.  Do you happen to be any relative to the Albert Nicholls who is superintendent over at the Downs Manufacturing Company?  He's sort of a near relative--my father.  Ah, yes?  I work for the Downs Company myself--bookkeeper----  Miss Carmody--the sick girl upstairs--she had a position there also, didn't she, before her mother died?  Yes. She had a job as stenographer for a time. When she graduated from the business college course--I was already working at the Downs--and through my father's influence--you understand. She was getting on finely, too, and liked the work. It's too bad--her mother's death, I mean--forcing her to give it up and come home to take care of those kids.  It's a damn shame. That's the main cause of her breakdown.  I've noticed she's been looking badly lately. So that's the trouble? Well, it's all her father's fault--and her own, too, because whenever I raised a kick about his making a slave of her, she always defended him. Between us, Carmody's as selfish as they make 'em, if you want my opinion.
EN002	0	Sir, you are sad! The silent eloquence Of yonder tear that trembles on your eyelash Proclaims a sorrow far more deep than common; Confide in me--fear not--I am a mother!  Yes, Little Buttercup, I'm sad and sorry-- My daughter, Josephine, the fairest flower That ever blossomed on ancestral timber, Is sought in marriage by Sir Joseph Porter, Our Admiralty's First Lord, but for some reason She does not seem to tackle kindly to it.  Ah, poor Sir Joseph! Ah, I know too well The anguish of a heart that loves but vainly! But see, here comes your most attractive daughter. I go--Farewell!  A plump and pleasing person!   Sorry her lot who loves too well, Heavy the heart that hopes but vainly, Sad are the sighs that own the spell, Uttered by eyes that speak too plainly; Heavy the sorrow that bows the head When love is alive and hope is dead!  Sad is the hour when sets the sun-- Dark is the night to earth's poor daughters, When to the ark the wearied one Flies from the empty waste of waters! Heavy the sorrow that bows the head When love is alive and hope is dead!    My child, I grieve to see that you are a prey to melancholy. You should look your best to-day, for Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., will be here this afternoon to claim your promised hand.  Ah, father, your words cut me to the quick. I can esteem-- reverence--venerate Sir Joseph, for he is a great and good man; but oh, I cannot love him! My heart is already given.  It is then as I feared. (Aloud.) Given? And to whom? Not to some gilded lordling?  No, father--the object of my love is no lordling. Oh, pity me, for he is but a humble sailor on board your own ship!$$$But speed thy steps, the cold will work thee ill.   I'll fly, dear mother, like an arrow home.    We must not tarry. Come, my Thomas, come!  Here is a place, now I must rest awhile! For many a league, for many a weary mile, We've trudged along since break of day began.   'Tis true, and I'm an old and ancient man, My joints are stiff, my bones are waxing old-- And the long night is bitter, bitter cold. Here take my cloak and keep thee warm within, And wait thee here while I search out an inn.   For hours I've trudged the street in fruitless quest, Here is an inn, mayhap at last we'll rest.    Husband, I'm faint; I can no farther go. Methinks I'll rest me here upon this loe.    Have courage, Mary, here's the hostess here.    We'd lodge with thee tonight.  Alas, I fear My inn is crowded to the very wall, Soldiers and scribes, the rich, the great, the small!   Is there room for us? My wife is ill.   My heart is sad and it is not my will To send you hence, but naught is left to do. Perhaps some other inn will shelter you.   Alas, the other inns are all the same!   Never was seen the like in Bethlehem.    My guests are merry, hear their jovial din!   I pity you, there's no room at the inn.    Our last hope gone! Now, what shall we do? My strength is leaving!   Would I could succor you. I'll wrap thee warm. Now rest thee here a while. We've traveled far, full many a weary mile.   Maiden, I fain would stop thee in thy flight-- Can'st tell where we could lodge this winter night?  That inn is crowded. There's one upon the hill.   I've tried them all, my wife is very ill.   That little stable there upon the loe,    'Tis snug and warm. 'Twill shield thee from the snow.   God's blessing on thy little head, sweet child! Come, Joseph, for the wind now waxes wild.
EN003	0	God! What beauty!  Umm?  I said: God! What beauty!  Aha!  Do you know that I have to repeat everything to you nowadays?  What?  That I have to repeat----  Yes; I heard. I'm sorry. I get absorbed.  In all but me.  My dear, your song was helping me like anything to get the mood. This paper is the very deuce--to balance between the historical and the natural.  Who wants the natural?  Umm! Wish I thought that! Modern taste! History may go hang; they're all for tuppence-coloured sentiment nowadays.  Is the Spring sentiment?  I beg your pardon, my dear; I didn't catch.  Beauty, beauty!  That's what I'm, trying to say here. The Orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty! Dash it! I get so sleepy; I wish you'd tell them to make the after-dinner coffee twice as strong.  I will.  How does this strike you? "Many Renaissance pictures, especially those of Botticelli, Francesca and Piero di Cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of Orpheus, and we owe a tiny gem--like Raphael 'Apollo and Marsyas' to the same Pagan inspiration."  We owe it more than that--rebellion against the dry-as-dust.  Quite. I might develop that: "We owe it our revolt against the academic; or our disgust at 'big business,' and all the grossness of commercial success. We owe----".  It--love.  PROF. [Abstracted] Eh!  I said: We owe it love.  Possibly. But--er I mustn't say that here--hardly!  Orpheus with his lute!  Most people think a lute is a sort of flute. My dear, if you're not going to sing again, d'you mind sitting down? I want to concentrate.  I'm going out.  Mind the dew!  The Christian virtues and the dew.  Not bad! Not bad! The Christian virtues and the dew. "How far we can trace the modern resurgence against the Christian virtues to the symbolic figures of Orpheus, Pan, Apollo, and Bacchus might be difficult to estimate, but----"   She'll get her throat bad. Sounds queer at night-H'm!   What's that girl's name?  Vanessa Hellgrove.  Aha!$$$But the grub's gittin' low.  They's enough to last a long time yit, if they're careful with it; and they's plenty of water.  They say it's not fit to eat--what's left; and the two years they signed on fur is up to-day. They might make trouble for you in the courts when we git home.  Let them make what law trouble they kin! I don't give a damn 'bout the money. I've got to git the ile! You ain't turnin' no sea lawyer, be you, Mr. Slocum?  Not by a hell of a sight, sir.  What do the fools want to go home fur now? Their share o' the four hundred barrel wouldn't keep them in chewin' terbacco.  They wants to git back to their old folks an' things, I s'pose.  'N you want to turn back too. Don't lie, Mr. Slocum. It's writ down plain in your eyes. I hope, Mr. Slocum, you ain't agoin' to jine the men agin me.  That ain't fair, sir, to say sich things.  I warn't much afeard o' that, Tom. You been with me nigh on ten year and I've learned ye whalin'. No man kin say I ain't a good master, if I be a hard one.  I warn't thinkin' of myself, sir--'bout turnin' home, I mean. But Mrs. Keeney, sir--seems like she ain't jest satisfied up here, ailin' like--what with the cold an' bad luck an' the ice an' all.  That's my business, Mr. Slocum. I'll thank you to steer a clear course o' that. The ice'll break up soon to no'the'ard. I could see it startin' to-day. And when it goes and we git some sun Annie'll pick up. It ain't the damned money what's keepin' me up in the Northern seas, Tom. But I can't go back to Homeport with a measly four hundred barrel of ile. I'd die fust. I ain't never come back home in all my days without a full ship. Ain't that true?  Yes, sir; but this voyage you been ice-bound, an'--  And d'you s'pose any of 'em would believe that--any o' them skippers I've beaten voyage after voyage? Can't you hear 'em laughin' and sneerin'--Tibbots n' Harris n' Simms and the rest--and all o' Homeport makin' fun o' me? "Dave Keeney, what boasts he's the best whalin' skipper out o' Homeport, comin' back with a measly four hundred barrel of ile!" [_The thought of this drives him into a frenzy and he smashes his fist down on the marble top of the sideboard._] I got to git the ile, I tell you! How could I figger on this ice? It's never been so bad before in the thirty year I been acomin' here. And now it's breakin' up. In a couple o' days it'll be all gone. And they's whale here, plenty of 'em. I know they is and I ain't never gone wrong yit. I got to git the ile! I got to git it in spite of all hell, and by God, I ain't agoin' home till I do git it!

Oh, thank you, Mr. Wishing Man. I feel ever so much better now.  Yes, indeed. My clothes are a perfect fit and nobody will laugh at me now.  I feel perfectly fan-tas-a-ma-gor-ious.  Oh, see the pretty French dollies. I wish they would talk to me.  If that's your wish, they can.  Can you talk?  Pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa!  And what can you say?  Ma-ma, ma-ma, ma-ma!  Go on and talk to me.  Mer-ry Christ-mas! Mer-ry Christ-mas!  I wish you could wind them up so they could walk around and play with us.  Is that your wish?  Oh, yes. Do you think you can do it?  I can try.  Pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa!  Here, stop her. She'll fall down. Here, turn around. Walk this way.  Ma-ma, ma-ma, ma-ma;  Oh, I think you are a darling.  Mer-ry Christ-mas! Mer-ry Christmas.  Here, wait for me.  Wind up the soldiers. Then each dolly can have a partner.  Allow me.  Allow me.  Allow me.  Oh, I wish they were all alive.  You do? Is that your wish? Then I'll make them all alive.  Hickety, kickety, bees in a hive, Witchery, twichery, you're alive.  Oh, lookee! Candy!  That's alive, too. Mr. Snookie Ookums, let me introduce you to Mr. Jim Dandy, a stick of candy.  Would he mind if I'd take a bite out of his leg?  You bet he would. I'm alive now.  And here comes Teddy Bear and Jimmy Bear. They're alive, too. And look at the Baby Elephant.$$$Oh, he's coming, he's coming. I'm going to get to see Santa Claus! Is it not wonderful? I'm going to see him. Let me look. Oh, it's getting bigger and _bigger_ and BIGGER!  Hurray! daddy's coming! daddy's coming!  Now I can hear the bells. Oh, it's coming closer and _closer_ and CLOSER. Look out, it's going to hit the boat!  He flew right by us.  Maybe he didn't see the boat. Oh, now he isn't coming at all.  Yes, he is. He's landed right over there. Here he comes; here he comes!  Here we are, Santa Claus. This is the place. Come in. Merry Christmas, Santa Claus, merry Christmas!   Hello, there--where are you? It's so dark I can't see a single thing.  Hello, daddy; merry Christmas.  Hello yourself. Merry Christmas to you, too. Are you all ready for me?  Yes, it's all ready. The magical tree is just waiting for your touch to turn into a real Christmas tree.  Oh, we're going to have a real Christmas tree.  Hello, who's this young person?  This is Anita.  And why isn't she sound asleep like the rest of the children?  She's such a good little girl that I told her she could stay up with me and wait until you came.  Oh, ho; so you've made a hit with my boy, Jack Frost, have you? Well, if that's the case, I guess you can stay.  But all of the children would like to see you, Santa Claus. See, they've prepared the candle and the wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem all for you. There's Sergius and Tomasso and Hulda and Meeny and Hans and Yakob and Neelda and Ah Goo and Sano San and Mieze and the leetla Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum. They've all been awfully good children. And Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike they brought the candle. They're good, too.
EN086	0	We do!  There!  Well, Dick, we wouldn't go for to hurt any fellow creature's feelings, but you can't expect a chap with such a name as Dick Deadeye to be a popular character--now can you?  No.  It's asking too much, ain't it?  It is. From such a face and form as mine the noblest sentiments sound like the black utterances of a depraved imagination It is human nature--I am resigned.   But, tell me--who's the youth whose faltering feet With difficulty bear him on his course?  That is the smartest lad in all the fleet--Ralph Rackstraw!  Ha! That name! Remorse! remorse! The Nightingale Sighed for the moon's bright ray And told his tale In his own melodious way! He sang "Ah, well-a-day!"  He sang "Ah, well-a-day!" The lowly vale For the mountain vainly sighed, To his humble wail The echoing hills replied. They sang "Ah, well-a-day!"  They sang "Ah, well-a-day!"  I know the value of a kindly chorus, But choruses yield little consolation When we have pain and sorrow too before us! I love--and love, alas, above my station!  He loves--and loves a lass above his station!  Yes, yes, the lass is much above his station!    A maiden fair to see, The pearl of minstrelsy, A bud of blushing beauty; For whom proud nobles sigh, And with each other vie To do her menial's duty. To do her menial's duty.  A suitor, lowly born, With hopeless passion torn, And poor beyond denying, Has dared for her to pine At whose exalted shrine A world of wealth is sighing. A world of wealth is sighing.  Unlearned he in aught Save that which love has taught (For love had been his tutor); Oh, pity, pity me-- Our captain's daughter she, And I that lowly suitor! And he that lowly suitor!  Ah, my poor lad, you've climbed too high: our worthy captain's child won't have nothin' to say to a poor chap like you. Will she, lads?  No, no.$$$Mush! Indade and I will ask your pardon a thousand times--and on my knees, if ye like. I didn't mean a word of what I said or did. But divil a woman in all the ports of the world has iver made a great fool of me that way before!  I see. You mean you're a lady-killer and they all fall for you.  Leave off your fooling! 'Tis that is after getting my back up at you. 'Tis no lie I'm telling you about the women. Though it's a great jackass I am to be mistaking you, even in anger, for the like of them cows on the waterfront is the only women I've met up with since I was growed to a man. I'm a hard, rough man and I'm not fit, I'm thinking, to be kissing the shoe-soles of a fine, dacent girl the like of yourself. 'Tis only the ignorance of your kind made me see you wrong. So you'll forgive me, for the love of God, and let us be friends from this out. I'm thinking I'd rather be friends with you than have my wish for anything else in the world.  Sure.  God bless you!  Ouch!  Your pardon, Miss. 'Tis a clumsy ape I am. It's great power I have in my hand and arm, and I do be forgetting it at times.  Gee, you're some strong, all right.  It's no lie, and why shouldn't I be, with me shoveling a million tons of coal in the stokeholes of ships since I was a lad only. Let you sit down, now, Miss, and I'll be telling you a bit of myself, and you'll be telling me a bit of yourself, and in an hour we'll be as old friends as if we was born in the same house. Sit down now, if you plaze.  Well--But we won't talk about me, see? You tell me about yourself and about the wreck.  I'll tell you, surely. But can I be asking you one question. Miss, has my head in a puzzle?  Well--I dunno--what is it?  What is it you do when you're not taking a trip with the Old Man? For I'm thinking a fine girl the like of you ain't living always on this tub.
EN087	0	We sail the ocean blue, And our saucy ship's a beauty; We're sober men and true, And attentive to our duty. When the balls whistle free O'er the bright blue sea, We stand to our guns all day; When at anchor we ride On the Portsmouth tide, We have plenty of time to play.   Hail, men-o'-war's men-safeguards of your nation Here is an end, at last, of all privation; You've got your play--spare all you can afford To welcome Little Buttercup on board.    For I'm called Little Buttercup--dear Little Buttercup, Though I could never tell why, But still I'm called Buttercup--poor little Buttercup, Sweet Little Buttercup I!  I've snuff and tobaccy, and excellent jacky, I've scissors, and watches, and knives I've ribbons and laces to set off the faces Of pretty young sweethearts and wives.  I've treacle and toffee, I've tea and I've coffee, Soft tommy and succulent chops; I've chickens and conies, and pretty polonies, And excellent peppermint drops. Then buy of your Buttercup--dear Little Buttercup; Sailors should never be shy; So, buy of your Buttercup--poor Little Buttercup; Come, of your Buttercup buy!  Aye, Little Buttercup--and well called--for you're the rosiest, the roundest, and the reddest beauty in all Spithead.  Red, am I? and round--and rosy! Maybe, for I have dissembled well! But hark ye, my merry friend--hast ever thought that beneath a gay and frivolous exterior there may lurk a canker-worm which is slowly but surely eating its way into one's very heart?  No, my lass, I can't say I've ever thought that.  I have thought it often.  Yes, you look like it! What's the matter with the man? Isn't he well?  Don't take no heed of him; that's only poor Dick Deadeye.  I say--it's a beast of a name, ain't it--Dick Deadeye?  It's not a nice name.  I'm ugly too, ain't I?  You are certainly plain.  And I'm three-cornered too, ain't I?  You are rather triangular.  Ha! ha! That's it. I'm ugly, and they hate me for it; for you all hate me, don't you?   Enter RALPH from hatchway$$$God blast it!  No, your kind never realises things till the crash comes--usually when it's too late. She kept on doing her work, I suppose--taking care of her brothers and sisters, washing, cooking, sweeping, looking after your comfort--worn out--when she should have been in bed--and---- But what's the use of talking? The damage is done. We've got to set to work to repair it at once. I'll write to-night to Dr. Stanton of the Hill Farm Sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy. And if luck is with us we can send her there at once. The sooner the better.  Is it sendin' Eileen away to a hospital you'd be? Then you'll not! You'll get that notion out of your head damn quick. It's all nonsense you're stuffin' me with, and lies, makin' things out to be the worst in the world. I'll not believe a word of Eileen having the consumption at all. It's doctors' notions to be always lookin' for a sickness that'd kill you. She'll not move a step out of here, and I say so, and I'm her father!  You refuse to let your daughter go to a sanatorium?  I do.  Then I'll have to report her case to the Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis of this county, and tell them of your refusal to help her.  Report all you like, and be damned to you!  A majority of the most influential men of this city are behind the Society. Do you know that? We'll find a way to move you, Carmody, if you try to be stubborn.  Ara, Doctor,you don't see the way of it at all. If Eileen goes to the hospital, who's to be takin' care of the others, and mindin' the house when I'm off to work?  You can easily hire some woman.  Hire? D'you think I'm a millionaire itself?  That's where the shoe pinches, eh? I'm not going to waste any more words on you, Carmody, but I'm damn well going to see this thing through! You might as well give in first as last.  But where's the money comin' from?
EN084	0	Bless my heart, how unfortunate! One of you may be Baptisto's son, for anything I know to the contrary; but the other is no less a personage than the only son of the late King of Barataria.  What!  And I trust--I trust it was that one who slapped me on the shoulder and called me his man!One of us a king!  Not brothers!  The King of Barataria!  Well, who'd have thought it!  But which is it?  What does it matter? As you are both Republicans, and hold kings in detestation, of course you'll abdicate at once. Good morning!  Oh, don't do that!  Well, as to that, of course there are kings and kings. When I say that I detest kings, I mean I detest bad kings.  I see. It's a delicate distinction.  Quite so. Now I can conceive a kind of king--an ideal king--the creature of my fancy, you know--who would be absolutely unobjectionable. A king, for instance, who would abolish taxes and make everything cheap, except gondolas--  And give a great many free entertainments to the gondoliers--  And let off fireworks on the Grand Canal, and engage all the gondolas for the occasion--  And scramble money on the Rialto among the gondoliers.  Such a king would be a blessing to his people, and if I were a king, that is the sort of king I would be.  And so would I!  Come, I'm glad to find your objections are not insuperable.  Oh, they're not insuperable.  No, they're not insuperable.  Besides, we are open to conviction.  Yes; they are open to conviction.  Oh! they've often been convicted.  Our views may have been hastily formed on insufficient grounds. They may be crude, ill-digested, erroneous. I've a very poor opinion of the politician who is not open to conviction.  Oh, he's a fine fellow!$$$Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year. And we'll be marching on Christmas.  Nora got a picture-book, Melissa got a rake, Every Mulligan on deck got oranges and cake, Got a bag of candy, too--and got the stomachache, But we'll be marching on Christmas.  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here, Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year. And we'll be marching on Christmas.  And did ye have a good time at the entertainment?  Indade and we did that. It was as good as a circus parade and a picture show together. They treated us just lovely.  Did they now? And you wasn't invited at all, at all.  They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.  Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.  I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have some of the Christmas present, too.  That's just like your father, Micky.  And did ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?  Scwumptious, just scwumptious.  And me sash niver busted in two at all. And I was one of the most stylish young ladies present, so I was.  And they had a great, big Christmas tree. Clean up to the ceiling. With lights and toys and candy and little stars and bright fairies and angels and everything.  And ould Santy Claus was there with a long white beard and a big pack of presents to everyone.  And I pulled Santa Claus' whiskers and they nearly fell off. He must be getting pretty old, 'cause his whiskers is coming loose.  And Santy Claus called out all the names and everybody got up when their names was called and he gave 'em a present.  And they never called our names at all, at all.
EN085	1	What's eating you, anyway? Don't you want no one to be nice to me except yourself?  Yes, Ay do, Anna--only not fallar on sea. But Ay like for you marry steady fallar got good yob on land. You have little home in country all your own--  Oh, cut it out! Little home in the country! I wish you could have seen the little home in the country where you had me in jail till I was sixteen! Some day you're going to get me so mad with that talk, I'm going to turn loose on you and tell you--a lot of things that'll open your eyes.  Ay don't vant--  I know you don't; but you keep on talking yust the same.  Ay don't talk no more den, Anna.  Then promise me you'll cut out saying nasty things about Mat Burke every chance you get.  Vhy? You like dat fallar--very much, Anna?  Yes, I certainly do! He's a regular man, no matter what faults he's got. One of his fingers is worth all the hundreds of men I met out there--inland.  Maybe you tank you love him, den?  What of it if I do?  Maybe--you tank you--marry him?  No! If I'd met him four years ago--or even two years ago--I'd have jumped at the chance, I tell you that straight. And I would now--only he's such a simple guy--a big kid--and I ain't got the heart to fool him. But don't never say again he ain't good enough for me. It's me ain't good enough for him.  Py yiminy, you go crazy, Ay tank!  Well, I been thinking I was myself the last few days. Guess I'll take a walk down to the end of the dock for a minute and see what's doing. I love to watch the ships passing. Mat'll be along before long, I guess. Tell him where I am, will you?  All right, Ay tal him.$$$Aye, it's the punishment o' God on him. Did ye ever hear of a man who wasn't crazy do the things he does? Who but a man that's mad would take his woman--and as sweet a woman as ever was--on a rotten whalin' ship to the Arctic seas to be locked in by the ice for nigh on a year, and maybe lose her senses forever--for it's sure she'll never be the same again.  She useter be awful nice to me before--she got--like she is.  Aye, she was good to all of us. 'Twould have been hell on board without her; for he's a hard man--a hard, hard man--a driver if there ever was one. I hope he's satisfied now--drivin' her on till she's near lost her mind. And who could blame her? 'Tis a God's wonder we're not a ship full of crazed people--with the ice all the time, and the quiet so thick you're afraid to hear your own voice.  She don't never speak to me no more--jest looks at me 's if she didn't know me.  She don't know no one--but him. She talks to him--when she does talk--right enough.  She does nothin' all day long now but sit and sew--and then she cries to herself without makin' no noise. I've seen her.  Aye, I could hear her through the door a while back.  She's cryin' now.  God send his soul to hell for the devil he is!  'Twould be like hitting a worm. It is nigh on two bells, Mr. Steward, and this truck not cleared yet.  Y-y-yes, sir.
EN082	1	Don't bring Hannibal in till I know where she's put Edward!  Bad dog! Bad dog!  Maud, do take him out! Tie him up. Here! No--something stronger! Poor darling Edward! You are a bad dog!  Edward began it, Ella. Bad dog! Bad dog!  Tie him up outside. Here, take my scarf. Where is my poor treasure? Catch! His ear's torn; I saw it.  Now! He smells horrible. Bad dog--getting into ponds to fight!  Tie him up, Maud. I must try in here.  Smell him, Bertie! You might have that pond drained, Squire!  All right! I've bound him up!  May I come in?  Just a second! I've got nothing on.  Oh! There you are!  I was just going to wade in----  Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in!  Done him good, little beast!  Why didn't you go in, Tommy?  Well, I would--only she----  I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful mouth!  Bad dog!  We must simply thank her tremendously! I shall never forget the way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist!  All right! Here's a bell!  The bleeding's stopped. Shall I send him in to you?  Oh, please! Poor darling!  Look! Hannibal's loose! Maud--Tommy. You!  Yes, I know--you'd like to! You SHALL bite him when it's safe. Oh! my darling, you DO---- Have you tied him properly this time?  With Bertie's braces.  Oh! but----  It's all right; they're almost leather.      By Jove! No. It was topping.  Her clothes must be ruined. That pond--ugh! Tommy, do have it drained.  I don't remember her face in church.  Ah! Yes. Who is she? Pretty woman!  I must get the Vet. to Edward. Tommy, do exert yourself!$$$If 'e keeps quiet, I won't. But I'm not accountable--not always, I tell you straight--not since I've been through that.  Nor p'raps he isn't.  Like as not. It takes the lynch pins out, I tell you.  God 'elp us!  Ah! We said that a bit too often. What we want we take, now; there's no one else to give it us, and there's no fear'll stop us; we seen the bottom of things.  P'raps he'll say that too.  Then it'll be 'im or me.  I'm frightened:  No, Daisy, no! The river's handy. One more or less. 'E shan't 'arm you; nor me neither. [He takes out a knife.]  Oh, no! Give it to me, Jim!  No fear! Shan't 'ave no need for it like as not. All right, little Daisy; you can't be expected to see things like what we do. What's life, anyway? I've seen a thousand lives taken in five minutes. I've seen dead men on the wires like flies on a flypaper. I've been as good as dead meself a hundred times. I've killed a dozen men. It's nothin'. He's safe, if 'e don't get my blood up. If he does, nobody's safe; not 'im, nor anybody else; not even you. I'm speakin' sober.  Jim, you won't go fightin' in the sun, with the birds all callin'?  That depends on 'im. I'm not lookin' for it. Daisy, I love you. I love your hair. I love your eyes. I love you.  And I love you, Jim. I don't want nothin' more than you in all the world.  Amen to that, my dear. Kiss me close!  "I'll be right there to-night, Where the fields are snowy white; Banjos ringing, darkies singing, All the world seems bright."  It's him!
EN083	0	Tommy, do lend a hand!  All right, Ella; all right! He doesn't mean what you mean!  Hold him, Tommy. He's sure to smell out Hannibal!   Jove! Clever if he can smell anything but himself. Phew! She ought to have the Victoria Cross for goin' in that pond.  So very sorry--had to have a bath, and change, of course!  We're so awfully grateful to you. It was splendid.  Quite.  Heroic! I was just myself about to----  Little beast will fight--must apologise--you were too quick for me----  Poor dears! They thought they were so safe in that nice pond!  Is he very badly torn?  Rather nasty. There ought to be a stitch or two put in his ear.  I thought so. Tommy, do----  All right. Am I to let him go?  No.  The fly's outside. Bertie, run and tell Jarvis to drive in for the Vet.  Run? Well, Maud--I----  The doctor would sew it up. My maid can go round.   Look! Catch him! Rector!  Bertie! Catch him!  Take this strop--he can't break that. And would these be any good to you?   Splendid, isn't she? I do admire her.  She's all there.  Most kind.  Eh?  Yes.  Ah!  Poor darling!  Ella, the Rector wants to get up!  Perhaps--just for a moment----  Oh!   So she's married!  Why?  Braces.  Oh! Yes. We ought to ask them to dinner, Tommy.  Ah! Yes. Wonder who they are?  Really very good of her to lend her husband's--I was-- er--quite----  That'll do, Bertie.  Caught the doctor just starting, So lucky!  Oh! Thank goodness!  How do, Lady Ella? How do, Squire?--how do, Rector? How de do? This the beastie? I see. Quite! Who'll hold him for me?  Oh! I!  D'you know, I think I'd better. It's so dreadful when it's your own, isn't it? Shall we go in here, doctor? Come along, pretty boy!    I dreaded it. She is splendid!$$$It's gatting pooty late in night, Anna. Must be near five bells.  Five bells? What time is that?

I've told you a hundred times I hated it. I'd rather have one drop of ocean than all the farms in the world! Honest! And you wouldn't like a farm, neither. Here's where you belong. But not on a coal barge. You belong on a real ship, sailing all over the world.  Ay've done dat many year, Anna, when Ay vas damn fool.  Oh, rats!

EN080	1	All you got to do is find the girl.  I have found her!  You have? When? I thought you was saying--  This night. If she'll be having me. 'Tis you I mean.  Say--are you--going crazy? Are you trying to kid me? Proposing--to me!--for Gawd's sake!--on such short acquaintance?  I'm telling you there's the will of God in it that brought me safe through the storm and fog to the wan spot in the world where you was! Think of that now, and isn't it queer--  Anna!  Who d'you think you're talking to--a slave?  You need gat rest, Anna. You gat sleep. What you doing here, you sailor fallar? You ain't sick like oders. You gat in fo'c's'tle. Dey give you bunk. You hurry, Ay tal you!  But he is sick. Look at him. He can hardly stand up.  Is it giving me orders ye are, me bucko? Let you look out, then! With wan hand, weak as I am, I can break ye in two and fling the pieces over the side--and your crew after you. I was forgetting. You're her Old Man and I'd not raise a fist to you for the world.  Come on in the cabin. You can have my bed if there ain't no other place.   Glory be to God, is it holding my arm about your neck you are! Anna! Anna! Sure it's a sweet name is suited to you.  Sssh! Sssh!  Whisht, is it? Indade, and I'll not. I'll be roaring it out like a fog horn over the sea! You're the girl of the world and we'll be marrying soon and I don't care who knows it!  Ssshh! Never mind that talk. You go to sleep.  Dat's your dirty trick, damn ole davil, you! But, py God, you don't do dat! Not while Ay'm living! No, py God, you don't!My Yosephine, come aboard de ship. Long time Ay wait for you.  I'm glad someone's feeling good. Gee, I sure wish we was out of this dump and back in New York.  Ay'm glad vhen ve sail again, too. Ay don't see vhy you don't like Boston, dough. You have good time here, Ay tank. You go ashore all time, every day and night veek ve've been here. You go to movies, see show, gat all kinds fun-- All with that damn Irish fallar!$$$Well, but you're the quiet one,surely! Glory be to God, I'd not know a soul was alive in the room, barrin' myself. What is it you're at, Mary, that there's not a word out of you?  I'm looking at the pictures.  It's the dead spit and image of your sister Eileen you are, with your nose always in a book; and you're like your mother, too, God rest her soul.It's Nora and Tom has the high spirits in them like their father; and Billy, too,--if he is a lazy, shiftless divil--has the fightin' Carmody blood like me. You're a Cullen like your mother's people. They always was dreamin' their lives out.There's no good in too many books, I'll tell you. It's out rompin' and playin' with your brother and sister you ought to be at your age, not carin' a fig for books. Is that auld fool of a doctor stayin' the night? If he had his wits about him he'd know in a jiffy 'tis only a cold has taken Eileen, and give her the medicine. Run out in the hall, Mary, and see if you hear him. He may have sneaked away by the front door.  He's upstairs. I heard him talking to Eileen.  Close the door, ye little divil! There's a freezin' draught comin' in. It's mad I am to be thinkin' he'd go without gettin' his money--the like of a doctor! Rogues and thieves they are, the lot of them, robbin' the poor like us! I've no use for their drugs at all. They only keep you sick to pay more visits. I'd not have sent for this bucko if Eileen didn't scare me by faintin'.  Is Eileen very sick, Papa?  If she is, it's her own fault entirely--weakenin' her health by readin' here in the house. This'll be a lesson for her, and for you, too. (_Irritably._) Put down that book on the table and leave it be. I'll have no more readin' in this house, or I'll take the strap to you!  It's only pictures.

Aye, damn, and damn the Arctic seas, and damn this rotten whalin' ship of his, and damn me for a fool to ever ship on it! He's a hard man--as hard a man as ever sailed the seas.  Aye.

Two years o' this dog's life, and no luck in the fishin', and the hands half starved with the food runnin' low, rotten as it is; and not a sign of him turnin' back for home! Home! I begin to doubt if ever I'll set foot on land again. What is it he thinks he's goin' to do? Keep us all up here after our time is worked out till the last man of us is starved to death or frozen? We've grub enough hardly to last out the voyage back if we started now. What are the men goin' to do 'bout it? Did ye hear any talk in the fo'c's'tle?  They said if he don't put back south for home to-day they're goin' to mutiny.  Mutiny? Aye, 'tis the only thing they can do; and serve him right after the manner he's treated them--'s if they weren't no better nor dogs.  BEN. The ice is all broke up to s'uth'ard. They's clear water s'far 's you can see. He ain't got no excuse for not turnin' back for home, the men says.  He won't look nowheres but no'the'ard where they's only the ice to see. He don't want to see no clear water. All he thinks on is gettin' the ile--'s if it was our fault he ain't had good luck with the whales. I think the man's mighty nigh losin' his senses.

I'm afeared there'll be trouble with the hands by the look o' things. They'll likely turn ugly, every blessed one o' them, if you don't put back. The two years they signed up for is up to-day.  And d'you think you're tellin' me something new, Mr. Slocum? I've felt it in the air this long time past. D'you think I've not seen their ugly looks and the grudgin' way they worked?  Well, Annie?

There's nothing to look at on deck--but ice.  I know--ice, ice, ice! But there's nothing to see down here but these walls.  You can play the organ, Annie.  I hate the organ.

Ah, now I must go up on deck and look at it, David!  Best not to-day, Annie. Best wait for a day when the sun shines.  But the sun never shines in this terrible place.  Best not to-day, Annie.  Very well, David.  Annie!  Yes, David.  Me and Mr. Slocum has business to talk about--ship's business.  Very well, David.  Best not have her on deck if they's goin' to be any trouble.  Yes, sir.  And trouble they's going to be. I feel it in my bones. Got your'n?  Yes, sir.  Not that we'll have to use 'em--not if I know their breed of dog--jest to frighten 'em up a bit. I ain't never been forced to use one yit; and trouble I've had by land and by sea s'long as I kin remember, and will have till my dyin' day, I reckon.  Then you ain't goin'--to turn back?  Turn back!

EN089	0	I forget nothing, haughty lady. I love you desperately, my life is in your hand--I lay it at your feet! Give me hope, and what I lack in education and polite accomplishments, that I will endeavour to acquire. Drive me to despair, and in death alone I shall look for consolation. I am proud and cannot stoop to implore. I have spoken and I wait your word.  You shall not wait long. Your proffered love I haughtily reject. Go, sir, and learn to cast your eyes on some village maiden in your own poor rank--they should be lowered before your captain's daughter.   Refrain, audacious tar, Your suit from pressing, Remember what you are, And whom addressing! I'd laugh my rank to scorn In union holy, Were he more highly born Or I more lowly! Proud lady, have your way, Unfeeling beauty! You speak and I obey, It is my duty! I am the lowliest tar That sails the water, And you, proud maiden, are My captain's daughter! My heart with anguish torn Bows down before her, She laughs my love to scorn, Yet I adore her!   Can I survive this overbearing Or live a life of mad despairing, My proffered love despised, rejected? No, no, it's not to be expected! (Calling off.) Messmates, ahoy! Come here! Come here!   Aye, aye, my boy, What cheer, what cheer? Now tell us, pray, Without delay, What does she say-- What cheer, what cheer?  The maiden treats my suit with scorn, Rejects my humble gift, my lady; She says I am ignobly born, And cuts my hopes adrift, my lady. Oh, cruel one.  She spurns your suit? Oho! Oho! I told you so, I told you so.   Shall { we } submit? Are { we } but slaves? they they Love comes alike to high and low-- Britannia's sailors rule the waves, And shall they stoop to insult? No!  You must submit, you are but slaves; A lady she! Oho! Oho! You lowly toilers of the waves, She spurns you all--I told you so!  My friends, my leave of life I'm taking, For oh, my heart, my heart is breaking. When I am gone, oh, prithee tell The maid that, as I died, I loved her well!$$$Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year. And we'll be marching on Christmas.  Nora got a picture-book, Melissa got a rake, Every Mulligan on deck got oranges and cake, Got a bag of candy, too--and got the stomachache, But we'll be marching on Christmas.  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here, Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year. And we'll be marching on Christmas.  And did ye have a good time at the entertainment?  Indade and we did that. It was as good as a circus parade and a picture show together. They treated us just lovely.  Did they now? And you wasn't invited at all, at all.  They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.  Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.  I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have some of the Christmas present, too.  That's just like your father, Micky.  And did ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?  Scwumptious, just scwumptious.  And me sash niver busted in two at all. And I was one of the most stylish young ladies present, so I was.  And they had a great, big Christmas tree. Clean up to the ceiling. With lights and toys and candy and little stars and bright fairies and angels and everything.  And ould Santy Claus was there with a long white beard and a big pack of presents to everyone.  And I pulled Santa Claus' whiskers and they nearly fell off. He must be getting pretty old, 'cause his whiskers is coming loose.  And Santy Claus called out all the names and everybody got up when their names was called and he gave 'em a present.  And they never called our names at all, at all.
EN039	1	Yes--we'll wait--certainly, we're all right.  I'll be havin' a nip now we're alone, and that cacklin' hen gone. I'm feelin' sick in the pit of the stomach.  For God's sake, don't! Put that bottle away! Don't you see that fellow in the chair there?  Ah, I'm not mindin' a man at all. Sure I'll bet it's himself would be likin' a taste of the same.  Stop it, you---- Don't you know he's probably a patient and they don't allow them----  A sick one, and him readin' a book like a dead man without a civil word out of him! It's queer they'd be allowin' the sick ones to read books, when I'll bet it's the same lazy readin' in the house brought the half of them down with the consumption itself. I'm thinking this whole shebang is a big, thievin' fake--and I've always thought so.  Put that bottle away, damn it! And don't shout. You're not in a public-house.  I'll put it back when I'm ready, not before, and no lip from you!  You're drunk now. It's disgusting.  Drunk, am I?

What'll Eileen say? Do you want to make trouble for her at the start?  It's a grand hotel this is, I'm thinkin', for the rich to be takin' their ease, and not a hospital for the poor, but the poor has to pay for it.  Sssh!  Don't be shshin' at me? I'm tellin' you the truth. I'd make Eileen come back out of this to-night if that divil of a doctor didn't have me by the throat.  I wonder how soon she'll be back? The carriage is waiting for us. We'll have to hurry to make that last train back. If we miss it--it means two hours on the damn tram.$$$Oh, 'tis you, is it? What're ye shiverin' 'bout? Stay by the stove where ye belong and ye'll find no need of chatterin'.  It's c-c-cold. Who d'ye think it were--the Old Man? None o' your lip, young un, or I'll learn ye. Where was it ye've been all o' the time--the fo'c's'tle?  Yes.  Let the Old Man see ye up for'ard monkeyshinin' with the hands and ye'll get a hidin' ye'll not forget in a hurry.  Aw, he don't see nothin'. He jest walks up and down like he didn't notice nobody--and stares at the ice to the no'the'ard.  He's always starin' at the ice. Ice, ice, ice! Damn him and damn the ice! Holdin' us in for nigh on a year--nothin' to see but ice--stuck in it like a fly in molasses!  Ssshh! He'll hear ye.  Aye, damn, and damn the Arctic seas, and damn this rotten whalin' ship of his, and damn me for a fool to ever ship on it! He's a hard man--as hard a man as ever sailed the seas.  Aye.  The two years we all signed up for are done this day! Two years o' this dog's life, and no luck in the fishin', and the hands half starved with the food runnin' low, rotten as it is; and not a sign of him turnin' back for home! Home! I begin to doubt if ever I'll set foot on land again. What is it he thinks he's goin' to do? Keep us all up here after our time is worked out till the last man of us is starved to death or frozen? We've grub enough hardly to last out the voyage back if we started now. What are the men goin' to do 'bout it? Did ye hear any talk in the fo'c's'tle?  They said if he don't put back south for home to-day they're goin' to mutiny.  Mutiny? Aye, 'tis the only thing they can do; and serve him right after the manner he's treated them--'s if they weren't no better nor dogs.  BEN. The ice is all broke up to s'uth'ard. They's clear water s'far 's you can see. He ain't got no excuse for not turnin' back for home, the men says.  He won't look nowheres but no'the'ard where they's only the ice to see. He don't want to see no clear water. All he thinks on is gettin' the ile--'s if it was our fault he ain't had good luck with the whales. I think the man's mighty nigh losin' his senses.  D'you really think he's crazy?

My inn is crowded to the doors. The heat Is stifling, but out here the air is sweet.    The bright stars twinkle with mysterious light, Methinks there's something strange about the night.

Well spoke! well spoke!  You're on a wrong tack, and so is he. He means well, but he don't know. When people have to obey other people's orders, equality's out of the question.  Horrible! horrible!

Don't lie about your poverty. You've a steady well-paid job, and plenty of money to throw away on drunken sprees, I'll bet. The weekly fee at the Hill Farm is only seven dollars.

Well, perhaps I can get the Society to pay half for your daughter--if you're really as hard up as you pretend. They're willing to do that where it seems necessary.  Ah, Doctor, thank you.  Then it's all settled?  I'll do my best for Eileen, if it's needful--and you'll not be tellin' them people about it at all, Doctor?  Not unless you force me to.  And they'll pay the half, surely?  I'll see what I can do--for your daughter's sake, not yours, understand!  God bless you, Doctor! It's the whole of it they ought to be payin', I'm thinkin', and them with bags of money. 'Tis them builds the hospitals and why should they be wantin' the poor like me to support them?  Bah! I'll telephone to Doctor Stanton to-morrow morning.

Didn't I write you year after year how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made of me? What'd you care? Nothing! Not even enough to come out and see me! That crazy bull about wanting to keep me away from the sea don't go down with me! You yust didn't want to be bothered with me! You're like all the rest of 'em!$$$That's because they didn't know them. They didn't expect you at the party.  It was a surprise party, maw.  How was it a surprise party, Mary Ann?  They all looked surprised when we came in.  When I saw they weren't going to call out our names, I just rose up in me seat and took the whole nine of 'em by the hand and marched right up to Santa Claus. He looked real surprised at the bunch of us.  I should think he would.  "And who are you?" says he. "We're the ten little Mulligans from Mulligan Alley in Shantytown," says I, as cool as an icicle. "And we're ready for our presents, if it's all the same to you," says I. I thought they was going to fire us out, but what did he do but dive way down in the bottom of the sack and give every last one of us a present?  And then he gave us bags of candy and oranges and apples and peanuts and popcorn and a candy cane, and then they had a show and Bridget Honora spoke a piece, she did.  How did ye happen to spake a piece, Bridget Honora?  I just stood up and told 'em I knowed one. There ain't nuthin' bashful about me. And I kind o' thought we ought to do something to help pay fer the good things they gave us.  That's me good little Bridget Honora.  Oh, wee! Lookee there! Where'd she come from?  Santa Claus was after being here while you were away and he left it for you.  Is it all for me?  It's the Mulligan dolly. It's fer all ten of yeez.  She can have my share. I don't want no dolls.

She kept on doing her work, I suppose--taking care of her brothers and sisters, washing, cooking, sweeping, looking after your comfort--worn out--when she should have been in bed--and---- But what's the use of talking? The damage is done. We've got to set to work to repair it at once. I'll write to-night to Dr. Stanton of the Hill Farm Sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy. And if luck is with us we can send her there at once. The sooner the better.  Is it sendin' Eileen away to a hospital you'd be? Then you'll not! You'll get that notion out of your head damn quick. It's all nonsense you're stuffin' me with, and lies, makin' things out to be the worst in the world. I'll not believe a word of Eileen having the consumption at all. It's doctors' notions to be always lookin' for a sickness that'd kill you. She'll not move a step out of here, and I say so, and I'm her father!  You refuse to let your daughter go to a sanatorium?  I do.  Then I'll have to report her case to the Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis of this county, and tell them of your refusal to help her.  Report all you like, and be damned to you!  A majority of the most influential men of this city are behind the Society. Do you know that? We'll find a way to move you, Carmody, if you try to be stubborn.  Ara, Doctor,you don't see the way of it at all. If Eileen goes to the hospital, who's to be takin' care of the others, and mindin' the house when I'm off to work?  You can easily hire some woman.  Hire? D'you think I'm a millionaire itself?  That's where the shoe pinches, eh? I'm not going to waste any more words on you, Carmody, but I'm damn well going to see this thing through! You might as well give in first as last.  But where's the money comin' from?$$$Not for mine. I'm full up. And you-- Had anythin' to eat lately?  Not since this morning on the train.  Then yuh better go easy on it, hadn't yuh?  Guess you're right. I got to meet someone, too. But my nerves is on edge after that rotten trip.  Yuh said yuh was just outa the hospital?  Two weeks ago. The joint I was in out in St. Paul got raided. That was the start. The judge give all us girls thirty days. The others didn't seem to mind being in the cooler much. Some of 'em was used to it. But me, I couldn't stand it. It got my goat right--couldn't eat or sleep or nothing. I never could stand being caged up nowheres. I got good and sick and they had to send me to the hospital. It was nice there. I was sorry to leave it, honest!  Did yuh say yuh got to meet someone here?  Yes. Oh, not what you mean. It's my Old Man I got to meet. Honest! It's funny, too. I ain't seen him since I was a kid--don't even know what he looks like--yust had a letter every now and then. This was always the only address he give me to write him back. He's yanitor of some building here now--used to be a sailor.  Janitor!  Sure. And I was thinking maybe, seeing he ain't never done a thing for me in my life, he might be willing to stake me to a room and eats till I get rested up. Gee, I sure need that rest! I'm knocked out. But I ain't expecting much from him. Give you a kick when you're down, that's what all men do. Men, I hate 'em--all of 'em! And I don't expect he'll turn out no better than the rest. Say, do you hang out around this dump much?  Oh, off and on.  Then maybe you know him--my Old Man--or at least seen him?  It ain't old Chris, is it?  Old Chris?  Chris Christopherson, his full name is.  Yes, that's him! Anna Christopherson--that's my real name--only out there I called myself Anna Christie. So you know him, eh?  Seen him about for years.

They're not expensive, any of them. Miss Hellgrove's a find, I think.  Pretty?  Quite.  Arty?  No. Look here, Mr FRUST, it's no use your expecting another "Pop goes the Weasel."

His foot should stamp and his throat should growl, His hair should twirl and his face should scowl;  His eyes should flash and his breast protrude, And this should be his customary attitude--  His foot should stamp, etc.   It is useless--Sir Joseph's attentions nauseate me. I know that he is a truly great and good man, for he told me so himself, but to me he seems tedious, fretful, and dictatorial. Yet his must be a mind of no common order, or he would not dare to teach my dear father to dance a hornpipe on the cabin table. Ralph Rackstraw!   Aye, lady--no other than poor Ralph Rackstraw!  How my heart beats! And why poor, Ralph?  I am poor in the essence of happiness, lady--rich only in never- ending unrest. In me there meet a combination of antithetical elements which are at eternal war with one another. Driven hither by objective influences--thither by subjective emotions--wafted one moment into blazing day, by mocking hope--plunged the next into the Cimmerian darkness of tangible despair, I am but a living ganglion of irreconcilable antagonisms. I hope I make myself clear, lady?  Perfectly. His simple eloquence goes to my heart. Oh, if I dared--but no, the thought is madness! Dismiss these foolish fancies, they torture you but needlessly. Come, make one effort.  I will--one. Josephine!  Sir!  Aye, even though Jove's armoury were launched at the head of the audacious mortal whose lips, unhallowed by relationship, dared to breathe that precious word, yet would I breathe it once, and then perchance be silent evermore. Josephine, in one brief breath I will concentrate the hopes, the doubts, the anxious fears of six weary months. Josephine, I am a British sailor, and I love you!  Sir, this audacity! Oh, my heart, my beating heart! This unwarrantable presumption on the part of a common sailor! Common! oh, the irony of the word! Oh, sir, you forget the disparity in our ranks.$$$In short, if you'd kindle The spark of a swindle, Lure simpletons into your clutches-- Yes; into your clutches. Or hoodwink a debtor, You cannot do better  Than trot out a Duke or a Duchess--  A Duke or a Duchess!  Ah! Their Majesties. Your Majesty!  The Duke of Plaza-Toro, I believe?  The same. Allow me to present--  The young lady one of us married?  CAS. Gentlemen, I am the most obedient servant of one of you. Oh, Luiz!  I am now about to address myself to the gentleman whom my daughter married; the other may allow his attention to wander if he likes, for what I am about to say does not concern him. Sir, you will find in this young lady a combination of excellences which you would search for in vain in any young lady who had not the good fortune to be my daughter. There is some little doubt as to which of you is the gentleman I am addressing, and which is the gentleman who is allowing his attention to wander; but when that doubt is solved, I shall say , "Take her, and may she make you happier than her mother has made me."  Sir!  If possible. And now there is a little matter to which I think I am entitled to take exception. I come here in state with Her Grace the Duchess and Her Majesty my daughter, and what do I find? Do I find, for instance, a guard of honour to receive me? No!  No.  The town illuminated? No!  No.   Refreshment provided? No!  No.  A Royal salute fired? No!  No.  Triumphal arches erected? No!  No.  The bells set ringing?  No.  Yes--one--the Visitors', and I rang it myself. It is not enough! It is not enough!  Upon my honour, I'm very sorry; but you see, I was brought up in a gondola, and my ideas of politeness are confined to taking off my cap to my passengers when they tip me.  That's all very well in its way, but it is not enough.

She will declare, etc.   Speak, woman, speak--  We're all attention!  The news we seek-  This moment mention.  To us they bring--  His foster-mother.  Is he the King?  Or this my brother?  Speak, woman, speak, etc.    The Royal Prince was by the King entrusted To my fond care, ere I grew old and crusted; When traitors came to steal his son reputed, My own small boy I deftly substituted! The villains fell into the trap completely-- I hid the Prince away--still sleeping sweetly: I called him "son" with pardonable slyness-- His name, Luiz! Behold his Royal Highness!  Luiz!  Casilda!  Get out, sir!  A hit, sir?  Take that, sir!  It's tit, sir,  For tat, sir!   When two doughty heroes thunder, All the world is lost in wonder; When such men their temper lose, Awful are the words they use!  Tall snobs, small snobs, rich snobs and needy ones!  Whom are you alluding to?  Where are you intruding to?  Fat snobs, thin snobs, swell snobs and seedy ones!  I rather think you err. To whom do you refer?  To you, sir!  To me, sir?  I do, sir!  We'll see, sir!  I jeer, sir! Grimace, sir!  Look here, sir-- A face, sir!   When two heroes, once pacific, Quarrel, the effect's terrific! What a horrible grimace! What a paralysing face!  Big bombs, small bombs, etc.  He has insulted me, and, in a breath, This day we fight a duel to the death!  You mean, of course, by duel A Statutory Duel.  Why, what's that?$$$That's your concern. Don't lie about your poverty. You've a steady well-paid job, and plenty of money to throw away on drunken sprees, I'll bet. The weekly fee at the Hill Farm is only seven dollars. You can easily afford that--the price of a few rounds of drinks.  Seven dollars! And I'll have to pay a woman to come in--and the four of the children eatin' their heads off! Glory be to God, I'll not have a penny saved for me old age--and then it's the poor-house!  Don't talk nonsense!  Ah, doctor, it's the truth I'm tellin' you!  Well, perhaps I can get the Society to pay half for your daughter--if you're really as hard up as you pretend. They're willing to do that where it seems necessary.  Ah, Doctor, thank you.  Then it's all settled?  I'll do my best for Eileen, if it's needful--and you'll not be tellin' them people about it at all, Doctor?  Not unless you force me to.  And they'll pay the half, surely?  I'll see what I can do--for your daughter's sake, not yours, understand!  God bless you, Doctor! It's the whole of it they ought to be payin', I'm thinkin', and them with bags of money. 'Tis them builds the hospitals and why should they be wantin' the poor like me to support them?  Bah! I'll telephone to Doctor Stanton to-morrow morning. Then I'll know something definite when I come to see your daughter in the afternoon.  You'll be comin' again tomorrow? Leave it to the likes of you to be drainin' a man dry.  There's someone knocking.

I'll see 'em.  Aye, aye, sir.  Here it comes, the trouble you spoke of, Mr. Slocum, and we'll make short shift of it. It's better to crush such things at the start than let them make headway.  Shall I wake up the First and Fourth, sir? We might need their help.  No, let them sleep. I'm well able to handle this alone, Mr. Slocum.  Well? Who's to speak fur ye?  I be.  So you be. Then speak your say and be quick about it.  The time we signed up for is done to-day.  You're tellin' me nothin' I don't know.  You ain't p'intin' fur home yit, far s'we kin see.

It's good enough fur ye. Better men than ye are have eaten worse.  We ain't agoin' to work no more less you puts back for home.  You ain't, ain't you?  No; and the law courts'll say we was right.

Then we're agoin' to mutiny and take the old hooker home ourselves. Ain't we, boys?  Hold still! You's found out it ain't safe to mutiny on this ship, ain't you?

Nutting--nutting. Anna!  Hello--father. She told me it was you. I yust got here a little while ago.  It's good--for see you--after all dem years, Anna.  It's good to see you, too.  Anna lilla! Anna lilla!  What's that--Swedish? I don't know it. Gee, I had an awful trip coming here. I'm all in.

EN100	1	Don't be alarmed--it's not serious. It is arranged that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we are to act as one person.  Exactly.  Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point of fact, two persons.  Ah, I don't think we can go into that. It is a legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things. Situated as we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.  No; but you can recognize two independent appetites. It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it as a legal fiction carried a little too far.  It's rather a nice point. I don't like to express an opinion off-hand. Suppose we reserve it for argument before the full Court?  Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?  We want our tea.  I think we may make an interim order for double rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to indemnify in the event of an adverse decision?  That, I think, will meet the case. But you must work hard--stick to it--nothing like work.  Oh, certainly. We quite understand that a man who holds the magnificent position of King should do something to justify it. We are called "Your Majesty"; we are allowed to buy ourselves magnificent clothes; our subjects frequently nod to us in the streets; the sentries always return our salutes; and we enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists to all the principal charities. In return for these advantages the least we can do is to make ourselves useful about the Palace.   Rising early in the morning, We proceed to light the fire, Then our Majesty adorning In its workaday attire, We embark without delay On the duties of the day.  First, we polish off some batches Of political despatches, And foreign politicians circumvent; Then, if business isn't heavy, We may hold a Royal levee, Or ratify some Acts of Parliament. Then we probably review the household troops-- With the usual "Shalloo humps!" and "Shalloo hoops!" Or receive with ceremonial and state An interesting Eastern potentate.$$$Impossible!  Yes, it is true.  A common sailor? Oh fie!  I blush for the weakness that allows me to cherish such a passion. I hate myself when I think of the depth to which I have stooped in permitting myself to think tenderly of one so ignobly born, but I love him! I love him! I love him!  Come, my child, let us talk this over. In a matter of the heart I would not coerce my daughter--I attach but little value to rank or wealth, but the line must be drawn somewhere. A man in that station may be brave and worthy, but at every step he would commit solecismsthat society would never pardon.  Oh, I have thought of this night and day. But fear not, father, I have a heart, and therefore I love; but I am your daughter, and therefore I am proud. Though I carry my love with me to the tomb, he shall never, never know it. You are my daughter after all. But see, Sir Joseph's barge approaches, manned by twelve trusty oarsmen and accompanied by the admiring crowd of sisters, cousins, and aunts that attend him wherever he goes. Retire, my daughter, to your cabin--take this, his photograph, with you--it may help to bring you to a more reasonable frame of mind.  My own thoughtful father!  Over the bright blue sea Comes Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., Wherever he may go Bang-bang the loud nine-pounders go! Shout o'er the bright blue sea For Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B.   Sir Joseph's barge is seen, And its crowd of blushing beauties, We hope he'll find us clean, And attentive to our duties. We sail, we sail the ocean blue, And our saucy ship's a beauty. We're sober, sober men and true And attentive to our duty. We're smart and sober men, And quite devoid of fe-ar, In all the Royal N. None are so smart as we are.
EN024	1	For I hold that on the seas The expression, "if you please", A particularly gentlemanly tone implants.  And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!  And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!  Ah! Sir Joseph's true gentleman; courteous and considerate to the very humblest.  True, Boatswain, but we are not the very humblest. Sir Joseph has explained our true position to us. As he says, a British seaman is any man's equal excepting his, and if Sir Joseph says that, is it not our duty to believe him?  Well spoke! well spoke!  You're on a wrong tack, and so is he. He means well, but he don't know. When people have to obey other people's orders, equality's out of the question.  Horrible! horrible!  Dick Deadeye, if you go for to infuriate this here ship's company too far, I won't answer for being able to hold 'em in. I'm shocked! that's what I am--shocked! Messmates, my mind's made up. I'll speak to the captain's daughter, and tell her, like an honest man, of the honest love I have for her.  Aye, aye!  Is not my love as good as another's? Is not my heart as true as another's? Have I not hands and eyes and ears and limbs like another?  Aye, Aye!  True, I lack birth--  You've a berth on board this very ship.  Well said--I had forgotten that. Messmates--what do yousay? Do you approve my determination?  We do.  I don t.  What is to be done with this here hopeless chap? Let us sing him the song that Sir Joseph has kindly composed for us. Perhaps it will bring this here miserable creetur to a proper state of mind.  A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic fist should be ready to resist A dictatorial word. His nose should pant and his lip should curl, His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl, His bosom should heave and his heart should glow, And his fist be ever ready for a knock-down blow.$$$Sullen night is laughing day-- All the year is merry May!  And now our lives are going to begin in real earnest! What's a bachelor? A mere nothing--he's a chrysalis. He can't be said to live--he exists.  What a delightful institution marriage is! Why have we wasted all this time? Why didn't we marry ten years ago?  Because you couldn't find anybody nice enough.  Because you were waiting for us.  I suppose that was the reason. We were waiting for you without knowing it. Hallo!  Good morning.  If this gentleman is an undertaker it's a bad omen.  Ceremony of some sort going on?  He is an undertaker! No--a little unimportant family gathering. Nothing in your line.  Somebody's birthday, I suppose?  Yes, mine!  And mine!  And mine!  And mine!  Curious coincidence! And how old may you all be?  It's a rude question--but about ten minutes. Remarkably fine children! But surely you are jesting?  In other words, we were married about ten minutes since.  Married! You don't mean to say you are married?  Oh yes, we are married.  What, both of you?  All four of us.  Bless my heart, how extremely awkward!  You don't mind, I suppose?  You were not thinking of either of us for yourself, I presume? Oh, Giuseppe, look at him--he was. He's heart-broken!  No, no, I wasn't! I wasn't!  Now, my man we don't want anything in your line to-day, and if your curiosity's satisfied--you can go!  You mustn't call me your man. It's a liberty. I don't think you know who I am.  Not we, indeed! We are jolly gondoliers, the sons of Baptisto Palmieri, who led the last revolution. Republicans, heart and soul, we hold all men to be equal. As we abhor oppression, we abhor kings: as we detest vain-glory, we detest rank: as we despise effeminacy, we despise wealth. We are Venetian gondoliers--your equals in everything except our calling, and in that at once your masters and your servants.

EN020	0	Of course I'm sure. It was awful big. The biggest fish I ever saw. Even in Russia we do not have such big fish as whales. Paddy Mike saw it, too.  Sure and I did. And me two eyes nearly fell out of me head with lookin' at it, it was that wonderful. He shot a big stream of water right up out of his head, he did, and then he dived down in the ocean again, and we didn't see him any more at all, at all.  There! Now if you get to see the great big whale, that's almost as good as having old Saint Nicholas come, ain't it?  Whales can't bring you no Christmas presents, can they, Klinker?  Und whales you can see any time. I'd rather have Saint Nicholas, wouldn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Who is this Saint Nicholas they are looking for, Hulda?  Why, don't you know who he is yet? He's the best old man that ever was. Und he comes the night before Christmas und visits all the little children in Holland.  Und in Germany, too.  Und if they're good they get candy und oranges und toys und things, don't they, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  Und if they're bad, they get a good big birch stick. But I ain't been bad. I've been awfully good, isn't I, Klinker?  Sure. Und me also.  On Christmas Eve in Holland all the children march around the streets, following one who carries a big silver star. And the people who meet us give us money and gifts to help the poor. Oh, Christmas time is just grand in Holland!  Und we set out our leedle wooden shoes und old Saint Nicholas fills 'em with candy.$$$Yes--we'll wait--certainly, we're all right.  I'll be havin' a nip now we're alone, and that cacklin' hen gone. I'm feelin' sick in the pit of the stomach.  For God's sake, don't! Put that bottle away! Don't you see that fellow in the chair there?  Ah, I'm not mindin' a man at all. Sure I'll bet it's himself would be likin' a taste of the same.  Stop it, you---- Don't you know he's probably a patient and they don't allow them----  A sick one, and him readin' a book like a dead man without a civil word out of him! It's queer they'd be allowin' the sick ones to read books, when I'll bet it's the same lazy readin' in the house brought the half of them down with the consumption itself. I'm thinking this whole shebang is a big, thievin' fake--and I've always thought so.  Put that bottle away, damn it! And don't shout. You're not in a public-house.  I'll put it back when I'm ready, not before, and no lip from you!  You're drunk now. It's disgusting.  Drunk, am I? Is it the like of a young jackass like you that's still wet behind the ears to be tellin' me I'm drunk?  For heaven's sake, Mr. Carmody, remember where we are and don't raise any rumpus. What'll Eileen say? Do you want to make trouble for her at the start?  It's a grand hotel this is, I'm thinkin', for the rich to be takin' their ease, and not a hospital for the poor, but the poor has to pay for it.  Sssh!  Don't be shshin' at me? I'm tellin' you the truth. I'd make Eileen come back out of this to-night if that divil of a doctor didn't have me by the throat.  I wonder how soon she'll be back? The carriage is waiting for us. We'll have to hurry to make that last train back. If we miss it--it means two hours on the damn tram.
EN021	1	Oh, he's coming, he's coming. I'm going to get to see Santa Claus! Is it not wonderful? I'm going to see him. Let me look. Oh, it's getting bigger and _bigger_ and BIGGER!  Hurray! daddy's coming! daddy's coming!  Now I can hear the bells. Oh, it's coming closer and _closer_ and CLOSER. Look out, it's going to hit the boat!  He flew right by us.  Maybe he didn't see the boat. Oh, now he isn't coming at all.  Yes, he is. He's landed right over there. Here he comes; here he comes!  Here we are, Santa Claus. This is the place. Come in. Merry Christmas, Santa Claus, merry Christmas!   Hello, there--where are you? It's so dark I can't see a single thing.  Hello, daddy; merry Christmas.  Hello yourself. Merry Christmas to you, too. Are you all ready for me?  Yes, it's all ready. The magical tree is just waiting for your touch to turn into a real Christmas tree.  Oh, we're going to have a real Christmas tree.  Hello, who's this young person?  This is Anita.  And why isn't she sound asleep like the rest of the children?  She's such a good little girl that I told her she could stay up with me and wait until you came.  Oh, ho; so you've made a hit with my boy, Jack Frost, have you? Well, if that's the case, I guess you can stay.  But all of the children would like to see you, Santa Claus. See, they've prepared the candle and the wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem all for you. There's Sergius and Tomasso and Hulda and Meeny and Hans and Yakob and Neelda and Ah Goo and Sano San and Mieze and the leetla Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum. They've all been awfully good children. And Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike they brought the candle. They're good, too.$$$My, I wisht I was a great, great, great big girl.  There, that's a wish that money can't buy.  Grandpa said he'd get us anything we wished for.  What do you wish, Snookums?  Wish Grandpaw would come home.  I know a real good wish. I wish it were Christmas every day. Don't you, Dumpling?  No, I don't. We'd have to have a present and a tree and a turkey and plum pudding every day of our lives. We'd get awfully tired of it after a while. Just think, we'd have to give away about a million presents every year.  I'll tell you what I really do wish.  What?  I wish we could do just like grown up folks do. I wish I was the biggest little girl in all the world.  And I wish so, too. I wish we were just awfully, awfully, awfully big--and then we could go to Aunt Clara's dinner party, and everywhere.  Me wish me was great big Snookums.  But money couldn't buy that wish, Dumpling.  No, that's right. But Grandpa said if he couldn't buy our wish he'd get it some other way.  How could he get it?  He said he'd tell the Wishing Man.  My, I wonder if there really is such a person!  I don't know. But I'd like to see him if there is.  I'll make a rhyme.  Good Mr. Wishing Man, how do you do? If there is such a person, we'd like to see you!    If you come from afar, if you come from near, Good Mr. Wishing Man, appear, appear! Well?  Well? Well!  Well?  Well, I'm here.  Who's here?  Why, I am here. You said you would like to see me and so I have come. I'm here.  Are you the Wishing Man?  That's my name.  I'm the friend of all the children, And I'll help you if I can,
EN022	1	You say right tang, Anna, py golly! It ain't nobody's fault! It's dat ole davil, sea!  Gee, won't you ever can that stuff? You said a minute ago you'd fixed something up--about me. What was it?  Ay'm shipping avay on sea again, Anna.  You're--what?  Ay sign on steamer sail to-morrow. Ay gat my ole yob--bo'sun. Ay tank dat's best tang for you. Ay only bring you bad luck, Ay tank. Ay make your mo'der's life sorry. Ay don't vant make yours dat way, but Ay do yust same. Dat ole davil, sea, she make me Yonah man ain't no good for nobody. And Ay tank now it ain't no use fight with sea. No man dat live going to beat her, py yingo!  So that's how you've fixed me, is it?  Yes, Ay tank if dat ole davil gat me back she leave you alone den.  But, for Gawd's sake, don't you see, you're doing the same thing you've always done? Don't you see--? But what's the use of talking. You ain't right, that's what. I'll never blame you for nothing no more. But how you could figure out that was fixing me--!  Dat ain't all. Ay gat dem fallars in steam-ship office to pay you all money coming to me every month vhile Ay'm avay.  Thanks. But I guess I won't be hard up for no small change.  It ain't much, Ay know, but it's plenty for keep you so you never gat go.  Shut up, will you? We'll talk about it later, see?  You like Ay go ashore look for dat Irish fallar, Anna?  Not much! Think I want to drag him back?  Py golly, dat booze don't go veil. Give me fever, Ay tank, Ay feel hot like hell.  What you got in your pocket, for Pete's sake--a ton of lead? [She reaches down, takes the coat and pulls out a revolver--looks from it to him in amazement.] A gun? What were you doing with this?$$$It's a wonder you wouldn't stop this machine grinding itself to bits, Mr. Murray.  I was hoping the darn thing would bust. It keeps you from talking to me. That's the real music.  It's easy to see you've got Irish in you. Do you know what I think? I think you're a natural born kidder. All newspaper reporters are like that, I've heard.  You wrong me terribly. And it isn't charitable to remind me of my job. I hoped to forget all about it up here.  I think it's great to be able to write. I wish I could. You ought to be proud of it.  I'm not. You can't call it writing--not what I did--small town stuff. But I wanted to ask you something. Do you know when I'm to be moved away to the huts?  In a few days, I guess. Don't be impatient. What's the matter? Don't you like us here at the Sanatorium?  Oh--you--yes! I don't care for the atmosphere, though. All those people in bed out there on the porch seem so sick. It's depressing. I can't do anything for them--and--it makes me feel so helpless.  Well, it's the rules, you know. All the patients have to come here first until Doctor Stanton finds out whether they're well enough to be sent out to the huts and cottages. And remember you're a patient just like the ones in bed out there--even if you are up and about.  I know it. But I don't feel as I were--really sick like them.  None of them do, either.  Yes, I suppose it's that pipe dream that keeps us all going, eh?  Well, you ought to be thankful. You're very lucky, if you knew it. Shall I tell you a secret? I've seen your chart and _you've_ no cause to worry. Doctor Stanton joked about it. He said you were too uninteresting--there was so little the matter with you.
EN023	0	No, no, captains' daughters don't marry foremast hands.  Shame! shame!  Dick Deadeye, them sentiments o' yourn are a disgrace to our common natur'.  But it's a strange anomaly, that the daughter of a man who hails from the quarter-deck may not love another who lays out on the fore-yard arm. For a man is but a man, whether he hoists his flag at the main-truck or his slacks on the main-deck.  Ah, it's a queer world!  Dick Deadeye, I have no desire to press hardly on you, but such a revolutionary sentiment is enough to make an honest sailor shudder.  My lads, our gallant captain has come on deck; let us greet him as so brave an officer and so gallant a seaman deserves.   My gallant crew, good morning. Sir, good morning!  I hope you're all quite well.  Quite well; and you, sir?  I am in reasonable health, and happy To meet you all once more.  You do us proud, sir!    I am the Captain of the Pinafore; And a right good captain, tool You're very, very good, And be it understood, I command a right good crew,  We're very, very good, And be it understood, He commands a right good crew.  Though related to a peer, I can hand, reef, and steer, And ship a selvagee; I am never known to quail At the furry of a gale, And I'm never, never sick at sea!  What, never?  No, never!  What, never?  Hardly ever!  He's hardly ever sick at seal Then give three cheers, and one cheer more, For the hardy Captain of the Pinafore!  I do my best to satisfy you all--  And with you we're quite content.  You're exceedingly polite, And I think it only right To return the compliment.  We're exceedingly polite, And he thinks it's only right To return the compliment.  Bad language or abuse, I never, never use, Whatever the emergency; Though "Bother it" I may Occasionally say, I never use a big, big D--  What, never?  No, never!  What, never?  Hardly ever!  Hardly ever swears a big, big D-- Then give three cheers, and one cheer more, For the well-bred Captain of the Pinafore!$$$Vell--Ay don't vant for Anna gat married. Listen, you fallar. Ay'm a ole man. Ay don't see Anna for fifteen year. She vas all Ay gat in vorld. And now ven she come on first trip--you tank Ay vant her leave me 'lone again?  Let you not be thinking I have no heart at all for the way you'd be feeling.  Den you do right tang, eh? You ship avay again, leave Anna alone. Big fallar like you dat's on sea, he don't need vife. He gat new gel in every port, you know dat.  God stiffen you! I'll not be giving you the lie on that. But divil take you, there's a time comes to every man, on sea or land, that isn't a born fool, when he's sick of the lot of them cows, and wearing his heart out to meet up with a fine dacent girl, and have a home to call his own and be rearing up children in it. 'Tis small use you're asking me to leave Anna. She's the wan woman of the world for me, and I can't live without her now, I'm thinking.  You forgat all about her in one veek out of port, Ay bet you!  You don't know the like I am. Death itself wouldn't make me forget her. So let you not be making talk to me about leaving her. I'll not, and be damned to you! It won't be so bad for you as you'd make out at all. She'll be living here in the States, and her married to me. And you'd be seeing her often so--a sight more often than ever you saw her the fifteen years she was growing up in the West. It's quare you'd be the one to be making great trouble about her leaving you when you never laid eyes on her once in all them years.  Ay taught it vas better Anna stay avay, grow up inland where she don't ever know ole davil, sea.  Is it blaming the sea for your troubles ye are again, God help you? Well, Anna knows it now. 'Twas in her blood, anyway.  And Ay don't vant she ever know no-good fallar on sea--  She knows one now.  Dat's yust it! Dat's yust what you are--no-good, sailor fallar! You tank Ay lat her life be made sorry by you like her mo'der's vas by me! No, Ay svear! She don't marry you if Ay gat kill you first!  Ho-ho! Glory be to God, it's bold talk you have for a stumpy runt of a man!  Vell--you see!

Edward began it, Ella. Bad dog! Bad dog!  Tie him up outside. Here, take my scarf. Where is my poor treasure? Catch! His ear's torn; I saw it.  Now! He smells horrible. Bad dog--getting into ponds to fight!  Tie him up, Maud. I must try in here.  Smell him, Bertie! You might have that pond drained, Squire!  All right! I've bound him up!  May I come in?  Just a second! I've got nothing on.  Oh! There you are!  I was just going to wade in----  Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in!  Done him good, little beast!  Why didn't you go in, Tommy?  Well, I would--only she----  I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful mouth!  Bad dog!  We must simply thank her tremendously! I shall never forget the way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist!  All right! Here's a bell!  The bleeding's stopped. Shall I send him in to you?  Oh, please! Poor darling!  Look! Hannibal's loose! Maud--Tommy. You!  Yes, I know--you'd like to! You SHALL bite him when it's safe. Oh! my darling, you DO---- Have you tied him properly this time?  With Bertie's braces.  Oh! but----  It's all right; they're almost leather.      By Jove! No. It was topping.  Her clothes must be ruined. That pond--ugh! Tommy, do have it drained.  I don't remember her face in church.  Ah! Yes. Who is she? Pretty woman!  I must get the Vet. to Edward. Tommy, do exert yourself!$$$I say; what's the matter? You were crying when I spoke to you.  Oh! nothing. The beautiful evening-that's all.  Cheer up!  Cheer up! You are not lonelee, like me.  I say, how did you how did you get into this? Isn't it an awfully hopeless sort of life?  Yees, it ees. You haf been wounded?  Just out of hospital to-day.  The horrible war--all the misery is because of the war. When will it end?  I say, what nationality are you?  Rooshian.  Really! I never met a Russian girl. I say, is it as bad as they make out?  Not when I haf anyone as ni-ice as you; I never haf had, though. You stopped because I was sad, others stop because I am gay. I am not fond of men at all. When you know--you are not fond of them.  Well, you hardly know them at their best, do you? You should see them in the trenches. By George! They're simply splendid--officers and men, every blessed soul. There's never been anything like it--just one long bit of jolly fine self-sacrifice; it's perfectly amazing.  I expect you are not the last at that. You see in them what you haf in yourself, I think.  Oh, not a bit; you're quite out! I assure you when we made the attack where I got wounded there wasn't a single man in my regiment who wasn't an absolute hero. The way they went in--never thinking of themselves--it was simply ripping.  It is the same too, perhaps, with--the enemy.  Oh, yes! I know that.  Ah! You are not a mean man. How I hate mean men!  Oh! they're not mean really--they simply don't understand.  Oh! You are a babee--a good babee aren't you?   But I li-ke you for it. It is so good to find a ni-ice man.  About being lonely? Haven't you any Russian friends?  Rooshian? No. The town is so beeg. Were you at the concert before you spoke to me?  Yes.  I too. I lofe music.  I suppose all Russians do.  I go there always when I haf the money.  What! Are you as badly on the rocks as that?
EN029	0	Oh, 'tis you, is it? What're ye shiverin' 'bout? Stay by the stove where ye belong and ye'll find no need of chatterin'.  It's c-c-cold. Who d'ye think it were--the Old Man? None o' your lip, young un, or I'll learn ye. Where was it ye've been all o' the time--the fo'c's'tle?  Yes.  Let the Old Man see ye up for'ard monkeyshinin' with the hands and ye'll get a hidin' ye'll not forget in a hurry.  Aw, he don't see nothin'. He jest walks up and down like he didn't notice nobody--and stares at the ice to the no'the'ard.  He's always starin' at the ice. Ice, ice, ice! Damn him and damn the ice! Holdin' us in for nigh on a year--nothin' to see but ice--stuck in it like a fly in molasses!  Ssshh! He'll hear ye.  Aye, damn, and damn the Arctic seas, and damn this rotten whalin' ship of his, and damn me for a fool to ever ship on it! He's a hard man--as hard a man as ever sailed the seas.  Aye.  The two years we all signed up for are done this day! Two years o' this dog's life, and no luck in the fishin', and the hands half starved with the food runnin' low, rotten as it is; and not a sign of him turnin' back for home! Home! I begin to doubt if ever I'll set foot on land again. What is it he thinks he's goin' to do? Keep us all up here after our time is worked out till the last man of us is starved to death or frozen? We've grub enough hardly to last out the voyage back if we started now. What are the men goin' to do 'bout it? Did ye hear any talk in the fo'c's'tle?  They said if he don't put back south for home to-day they're goin' to mutiny.  Mutiny? Aye, 'tis the only thing they can do; and serve him right after the manner he's treated them--'s if they weren't no better nor dogs.  BEN. The ice is all broke up to s'uth'ard. They's clear water s'far 's you can see. He ain't got no excuse for not turnin' back for home, the men says.  He won't look nowheres but no'the'ard where they's only the ice to see. He don't want to see no clear water. All he thinks on is gettin' the ile--'s if it was our fault he ain't had good luck with the whales. I think the man's mighty nigh losin' his senses.  D'you really think he's crazy?$$$Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year. And we'll be marching on Christmas.  Nora got a picture-book, Melissa got a rake, Every Mulligan on deck got oranges and cake, Got a bag of candy, too--and got the stomachache, But we'll be marching on Christmas.  Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here, Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear, Sure, it was a happy night, The best one in the year. And we'll be marching on Christmas.  And did ye have a good time at the entertainment?  Indade and we did that. It was as good as a circus parade and a picture show together. They treated us just lovely.  Did they now? And you wasn't invited at all, at all.  They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.  Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.  I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have some of the Christmas present, too.  That's just like your father, Micky.  And did ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?  Scwumptious, just scwumptious.  And me sash niver busted in two at all. And I was one of the most stylish young ladies present, so I was.  And they had a great, big Christmas tree. Clean up to the ceiling. With lights and toys and candy and little stars and bright fairies and angels and everything.  And ould Santy Claus was there with a long white beard and a big pack of presents to everyone.  And I pulled Santa Claus' whiskers and they nearly fell off. He must be getting pretty old, 'cause his whiskers is coming loose.  And Santy Claus called out all the names and everybody got up when their names was called and he gave 'em a present.  And they never called our names at all, at all.

Glory be to God, I'll not have a penny saved for me old age--and then it's the poor-house!  Don't talk nonsense!  Ah, doctor, it's the truth I'm tellin' you!  Well, perhaps I can get the Society to pay half for your daughter--if you're really as hard up as you pretend. They're willing to do that where it seems necessary.  Ah, Doctor, thank you.  Then it's all settled?  I'll do my best for Eileen, if it's needful--and you'll not be tellin' them people about it at all, Doctor?  Not unless you force me to.  And they'll pay the half, surely?  I'll see what I can do--for your daughter's sake, not yours, understand!  God bless you, Doctor! It's the whole of it they ought to be payin', I'm thinkin', and them with bags of money.

Well--there you have me! All I know is she's a first-rate nurse--been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane. Nice woman, too--thorough good sort! Quite an acquisition here. H'm! Excuse me hurryin' off--very late. Good-bye, Rector. Good-bye, Lady Ella. Good-bye!    H'm! I suppose we ought to be a bit careful.   Beg pardon, sir. Is the little dog all right?  Yes.  Seein' you've missed your train, m'm, shall I wait, and take you 'ome again?  No.  Cert'nly, m'm.  Oh, Jarvis--what's the name of the people here?  Challenger's the name I've driven 'em in, my lady.  Challenger? Sounds like a hound. What's he like?  Wears a soft 'at, sir.  H'm! Ah!  Very nice gentleman, very nice lady. 'Elped me with my old mare when she 'ad the 'ighsteria last week--couldn't 'a' been kinder if they'd 'a' been angels from 'eaven. Wonderful fond o' dumb animals, the two of 'em. I don't pay no attention to gossip, meself.  Gossip? What gossip?  Did I make use of the word, m'm? You'll excuse me, I'm sure. There's always talk where there's newcomers. I takes people as I finds 'em.
EN053	1	Don't be standin' there like a hawk, Harpooner. Speak up!  We want--the men, sir--they wants to send a depitation aft to have a word with you.  Tell 'em to go to--Tell 'em to come. I'll see 'em.  Aye, aye, sir.  Here it comes, the trouble you spoke of, Mr. Slocum, and we'll make short shift of it. It's better to crush such things at the start than let them make headway.  Shall I wake up the First and Fourth, sir? We might need their help.  No, let them sleep. I'm well able to handle this alone, Mr. Slocum.  Well? Who's to speak fur ye?  I be.  So you be. Then speak your say and be quick about it.  The time we signed up for is done to-day.  You're tellin' me nothin' I don't know.  You ain't p'intin' fur home yit, far s'we kin see.  No, and I ain't agoin' to till this ship is full of ile.  You can't go no further no'the with the ice before ye.  The ice is breaking up. The grub we're gittin' now is rotten.  It's good enough fur ye. Better men than ye are have eaten worse.  We ain't agoin' to work no more less you puts back for home.  You ain't, ain't you?  No; and the law courts'll say we was right.  To hell with your law courts! We're at sea now and I'm the law on this ship! And every mother's son of you what don't obey orders goes in irons.  Then we're agoin' to mutiny and take the old hooker home ourselves. Ain't we, boys?  Hold still! You's found out it ain't safe to mutiny on this ship, ain't you? And now git for'ard where ye belong, and--[drag him with you. And remember, the first man of ye I see shirkin' I'll shoot dead as sure as there's a sea under us, and you can tell the rest the same. Git for'ard now! Quick! [Best get up on deck, Mr. Slocum, and see to it they don't try none of their skulkin' tricks. We'll have to keep an eye peeled from now on. I know 'em.  Yes, sir.  There, there, Annie. Don't be feared. It's all past and gone.  Oh, I can't bear it! I can't bear it any longer!  Can't bear what, Annie?  All this horrible brutality, and these brutes of men, and this terrible ship, and this prison cell of a room, and the ice all around, and the silence.$$$God blast it!  No, your kind never realises things till the crash comes--usually when it's too late. She kept on doing her work, I suppose--taking care of her brothers and sisters, washing, cooking, sweeping, looking after your comfort--worn out--when she should have been in bed--and---- But what's the use of talking? The damage is done. We've got to set to work to repair it at once. I'll write to-night to Dr. Stanton of the Hill Farm Sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy. And if luck is with us we can send her there at once. The sooner the better.  Is it sendin' Eileen away to a hospital you'd be? Then you'll not! You'll get that notion out of your head damn quick. It's all nonsense you're stuffin' me with, and lies, makin' things out to be the worst in the world. I'll not believe a word of Eileen having the consumption at all. It's doctors' notions to be always lookin' for a sickness that'd kill you. She'll not move a step out of here, and I say so, and I'm her father!  You refuse to let your daughter go to a sanatorium?  I do.  Then I'll have to report her case to the Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis of this county, and tell them of your refusal to help her.  Report all you like, and be damned to you!  A majority of the most influential men of this city are behind the Society. Do you know that? We'll find a way to move you, Carmody, if you try to be stubborn.  Ara, Doctor,you don't see the way of it at all. If Eileen goes to the hospital, who's to be takin' care of the others, and mindin' the house when I'm off to work?  You can easily hire some woman.  Hire? D'you think I'm a millionaire itself?  That's where the shoe pinches, eh? I'm not going to waste any more words on you, Carmody, but I'm damn well going to see this thing through! You might as well give in first as last.  But where's the money comin' from?
EN052	0	Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye These floral tributes extraordinary?  For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri, The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.  They're coming here, as we have heard but lately, To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.  Do all you maidens love them?  Passionately!  These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!  But what of us, who one and all adore you?  Have pity on our passion, we implore you!  These gentlemen must make their choice before you;  In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.  When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty-- Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.  Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.  With pleasure, nobody contradicente!  For the merriest fellows are we, tra la, That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;  With loving and laughing, And quipping and quaffing, We're happy as happy can be, tra la-- With loving and laughing, etc. With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la, And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la; And Jealousy yellow, Unfortunate fellow, We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la-- And Jealousy yellow, etc.  See, see, at last they come to make their choice-- Let us acclaim them with united voice.    Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti! Accept our love, our homage, and our duty. Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!  We're called gondolieri, But that's a vagary, It's quite honorary The trade that we ply. For gallantry noted Since we were short-coated, To beauty devoted, Giuseppe\Are Marco and I;  When morning is breaking, Our couches forsaking, To greet their awaking With carols we come. At summer day's nooning, When weary lagooning, Our mandolins tuning, We lazily thrum.  When vespers are ringing, To hope ever clinging, With songs of our singing A vigil we keep, When daylight is fading, Enwrapt in night's shading, With soft serenading We sing them to sleep.  We're called gondolieri, etc.$$$That's your concern. Don't lie about your poverty. You've a steady well-paid job, and plenty of money to throw away on drunken sprees, I'll bet. The weekly fee at the Hill Farm is only seven dollars. You can easily afford that--the price of a few rounds of drinks.  Seven dollars! And I'll have to pay a woman to come in--and the four of the children eatin' their heads off! Glory be to God, I'll not have a penny saved for me old age--and then it's the poor-house!  Don't talk nonsense!  Ah, doctor, it's the truth I'm tellin' you!  Well, perhaps I can get the Society to pay half for your daughter--if you're really as hard up as you pretend. They're willing to do that where it seems necessary.  Ah, Doctor, thank you.  Then it's all settled?  I'll do my best for Eileen, if it's needful--and you'll not be tellin' them people about it at all, Doctor?  Not unless you force me to.  And they'll pay the half, surely?  I'll see what I can do--for your daughter's sake, not yours, understand!  God bless you, Doctor! It's the whole of it they ought to be payin', I'm thinkin', and them with bags of money. 'Tis them builds the hospitals and why should they be wantin' the poor like me to support them?  Bah! I'll telephone to Doctor Stanton to-morrow morning. Then I'll know something definite when I come to see your daughter in the afternoon.  You'll be comin' again tomorrow? Leave it to the likes of you to be drainin' a man dry.  There's someone knocking.
EN055	0	Oh, come on, quick, Dumpling, before he changes his mind.  It's a very foolish wish, but maybe they'll be satisfied if I make them the biggest children on earth. I'll see what I can do.  I'm standing up on the table now.    Hickety, kickety, setting sun,  Thunder, lightning, flash of a gun! Let him grow bigger, it won't be much fun; Hickety, kickety, number one!  Now it's my turn. I'm on the table.    Witchery, twitchery, kangaroo, Thunder and lightning, Kalamazoo! Lengthen her, strengthen her, rip, bazoo, Make her a giantess, number two!  Now, Mr. Wishing Man, I'm on the table.  That's the Baby Snookums. Very well, little Snookie Ookums! I'll change you into the biggest baby on earth.  Rumpety, thumpety, Kankakee, Lengthen him out to six foot three! The biggest baby we ever did see, Rumpety, thumpety, number three!   Goodness, gracious! Is it a tornado or an earthquake? Oh! And who are you? Murder! Thieves! Robbers! Where's me children? Where's little Dumpling and Tootsy and Baby Snookums?  Where are your children?  They join hands and dance around at  There they are. There are little Dumpling and Tootsy and Baby Snookums.  Hello, little boys and girls, how do you do this fine winter night? I know what each of you has been thinking. You've been wishing that _you_ could meet the Wishing Man and that he would make your wishes come true. Now, haven't you? Well, I've made that wish come true. You wished to meet me, and here I am. I've been watching you all the year in Sunday School. I know how you have worked over your lessons, how you have helped your teachers and how punctual you have been. To be sure, I know some of you haven't helped your teachers as much as you could have done, but I'll forget all that at Christmas time. Now tell me what you wish for most.$$$I'll do my best, Doctor. (_As if he couldn't yet believe his ears--shuddering!_) Good heavens! She never said a word about--being so ill. She's had a cold. But, Doctor--do you think this sanatorium will----?  Most certainly. She has every chance. The Hill Farm has a really surprising record of arrested cases--as good as any place in the country. Of course, she'll never be able to live as carelessly as before, even after the most favourable results. She'll have to take care of herself. I'm telling you all this as being the one most intimately concerned. I don't count Carmody. You are the one who will have to assume responsibility for her welfare when she returns to everyday life.  Yes--certainly. Where is this sanatorium, Doctor--very far away?  Half an hour by train to the town. The sanatorium is two miles out on the hills--a nice drive. You'll be able to see her whenever you've a day off. It's a pleasant trip.  You said--Eileen ought to be sent away--for the sake of those around her----?  That's obvious. T.B. is extremely contagious, you must know that. Yet I'll bet she's been fondling and kissing those brothers and sisters of hers regardless. And look at this house sealed tight against the fresh air! Not a window open an inch! That's what we're up against in the fight with T.B.--a total ignorance of the commonest methods of prevention----  Then the kids might have gotten it--by kissing Eileen?  It stands to reason that's a common means of communication.  Yes. I suppose it must be. But that's terrible, isn't it? I'll promise you, Doctor, I'll tell Carmody straight what's what. He'll pay attention to me or I'll know the reason why.  Good boy! You've probably saved me a disagreeable squabble. I won't wait for Carmody. The sight of him makes me lose my temper. Tell him I'll be back to-morrow with definite information about the sanatorium.  All right, Doctor.

Want a nice, big twumpet to blow.  There you are, my little man.  I want one, too. A nice loud one.  And there's one for you, Tootsy.  Believe I'll take a drum.  There you are. Right off the tree.  Now we'll have a parade.  Here, here, wait a minute. You're making enough noise to wake the dead. Hold on, there. Quiet, quiet!  Oh, dear! Just as we were having such a lovely time.  Oh, whee! See the funny box. What is in it, Mr. Wishing Man?  You'd better let it alone. That's Ka-zin-ski, and Ka-zin-ski doesn't like babies.  But I wish to see him.  Is it a wish?  Yes, sir; it's a wish.  Then pull the string.  Oh, whee! Take him away! I'm fwightened, I am. Vill he come after me?  No, no. Get up, 'ittie Snookie Ookums, he won't hurt you.  Say, Mr. Wishing Man?  What is it, my little boy?  Can we have anything we wish for here in the Wishing Land?  Of course you can. That's what the Wishing Land is for.  Then I wish I was a little boy again. I'm too big to enjoy myself.  And I wish I was a little girl again. Everybody laughs at me, 'cause I'm so big.  And I wish I was a 'ittie, teeny, weeny baby again. Being so big fwightens me so.  Oh, ho! So you all want to be little again?  Yes, sir, if you please.  Why, I'm so big that I can't get all of me into bed. I'll have to let my feet hang outside.
EN057	0	I wanted to talk to you.  I could have talked to you from the hall. You're silly to take chances just now.  You'll be stayin' a while now, Fred? I'll take a walk down the road. I'm needin' a drink to clear my wits.  You won't be long, Father? And please don't--you know.  Sure who wouldn't get drunk with all the sorrows of the world piled on him?  Honestly, Eileen, your father is the limit. I don't see how you stand for him. He's the most selfish----  Sssh! You mustn't, Fred. He's not to blame. He just doesn't understand. Don't! Let's not talk about him now. We won't have many more evenings together for a long, long time. Did father or the Doctor tell you----  Everything there was to tell, I guess.  You mustn't worry, Fred. Please don't! It'd make it so much worse for me if I thought you did. I'll be all right. I'll do exactly what they tell me, and in a few months I'll be back so fat and healthy you won't know me.  Oh, there's no doubt of that. No one's worrying about your not getting well quick.  It won't be long. We can write often, and it isn't far away. You can come out and see me every Sunday--if you want to.  Of course I will!  Why do you act so funny? Why don't you sit down--here, by me? Don't you want to?  I--I'm all flustered, Eileen. I don't know what I'm doing.  Poor Fred! I'm so sorry I have to go. I didn't want to at first. I knew how hard it would be on father and the kids--especially little Mary. And then the doctor said if I stayed I'd be putting them all in danger. He even ordered me not to kiss them any more. So I've got to go and get well, don't you see?  Yes--it's better.  I'll miss the kids so much. Taking care of them has meant so much to me since mother died. But I'll miss you most of all, Fred. Fred! Why--why didn't you kiss--what is it? Are you--afraid? Oooh!  No! What--what d'you mean?  No, no, you mustn't! I was wrong. The doctor told you not to, didn't he? Please don't, Fred! It would be awful if anything happened to you--through me. But you can kiss me on the forehead, Fred. That can't do any harm. It seems so silly--being kissed that way--by you. (_She gulps back a sob and continued to attempt to joke._) I'll have to get used to it, won't I?$$$A Christmas tree. A look at old Santa Claus. Some nice Christmas presents, etc.  Stop, stop. I can't attend to so many wishes at once.  Please, Mr. Wishing Man, couldn't you tell us what we'd better wish for?  Have you ever had a great, big Christmas tree?  Oh, yes, lots of times.  Have you ever seen my old friend, Mr. Santa Claus?  Oh, yes.  We see him every year at Christmas.  How would like to go with me to Wishing Land.  Oh, goody! That would be fine. Can you take us there?  Of course I can. And that's just what we'll do. We'll all of us go to the Wishing Land. First, I'll call little Dumpling. Dumpling, little Dumpling, where are you?  Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. I was playing with my little horse and wagon.  And how do you like being a great, big Dumpling?  Well, not very well. I'm always bumping my head on the doors and things. And all my toys are so very little I'm always breaking them.  Where is your sister? Where is little Tootsy?  Here, Mr. Wishing Man. I'm here. Me and my little dolly.  Well, little Tootsy, how do you like being a great, big Tootsy?  I don't like it very well. My clothes don't seem to fit, and I know I look awfully funny. Don't I? Everybody laughs at me and it always makes me cry.  And where is little Snookie Ookums?  Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. Here's 'ittie Snookie Ookums.  You look like a 'ittie baby elephant, Snookie Ookums. Well, are you children satisfied with your wish?  Not very much. We wish we were little again.  I tried to ride my little horsie and I bweaked him all to pieces.  And I can't get enough to eat. My little knife and fork and spoon are too little, and when I eat I swallow dishes and all.  And all my clothes are too little for me, and I look so funny that everybody laughs at me. And I don't like it at all.
EN056	0	Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.  Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence. They're all so singularly kind and considerate. You don't find them wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying "It's my turn now." No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and never seem to grudge it.  It makes one feel quite selfish. It almost seems like taking advantage of their good nature.  How nice they were about the double rations.  Most considerate. Ah! there's only one thing wanting to make us thoroughly comfortable.  And that is?  The dear little wives we left behind us three months ago.  Yes, it is dull without female society. We can do without everything else, but we can't do without that.  And if we have that in perfection, we have everything. There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.    Take a pair of sparkling eyes, Hidden, ever and anon, In a merciful eclipse-- Do not heed their mild surprise-- Having passed the Rubicon, Take a pair of rosy lips; Take a figure trimly planned-- Such as admiration whets-- (Be particular in this); Take a tender little hand, Fringed with dainty fingerettes, Press it--in parenthesis;-- Ah! Take all these, you lucky man-- Take and keep them, if you can!  Take a pretty little cot-- Quite a miniature affair-- Hung about with trellised vine, Furnish it upon the spot With the treasures rich and rare I've endeavoured to define. Live to love and love to live-- You will ripen at your ease, Growing on the sunny side-- You're a dainty man to please If you are not satisfied. Ah! Take my counsel, happy man; Act upon it, if you can!  Here we are, at the risk of our lives, From ever so far, and we've brought your wives-- And to that end we've crossed the main, And don't intend to return again!$$$Sure, he has. Who do you think takes care of the reindeer, and who waters the doll-tree and picks the dolls?  Picks the dolls? Do the dolls grow on trees?  Yes, indeed, right next door to the taffy cottage, down Chocolate Lane. I take care of the marble bushes and the popgun trees. You just ought to see our wonderful gardens.  Oh, I'd love to see them.  We've got a Teddy-bear garden, and a tool garden, and a  furniture garden, and a game garden, and a candy garden, though most of the candy comes from mines.  The mines?  Sure. We dig out just the kind we want. We have caramel mines, and vanilla mines and mines full of chocolate almonds, and rivers of fig paste and strawberry ice cream soda. They flow right through the picture-book garden.  Oh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.  And I help take care of it. I have fourteen little brothers, and we're all twins.  And have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice-a, fine-a wife?  Of course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever heard of my mother. Her name is Mary.  Mary? Mary what?  Why, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone knew that.  And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night before Christmas?  Oh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and takes care of the gardens.  But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd be with your father.  Ah, that is a secret. You mustn't tell anyone.  How can I tell anyone when I don't know myself.  Well, maybe I'll tell you.

And you wasn't invited at all, at all.  They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.  Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.  I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have some of the Christmas present, too.  That's just like your father, Micky.  And did ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?

EN058	1	I've heard Old Chris talkin' about your bein' a nurse girl out there. Was that all a bluff yuh put up when yuh wrote him?  Not on your life, it wasn't. It was true for two years. I didn't go wrong all at one jump. Being a nurse girl was yust what finished me. Taking care of other people's kids, always listening to their bawling and crying, caged in, when you're only a kid yourself and want to go out and see things. At last I got the chance--to get into that house. And you bet your life I took it! And I ain't sorry neither. It was all men's fault--the whole business. It was men on the farm ordering and beating me--and giving me the wrong start. Then when I was a nurse, it was men again hanging around, bothering me, trying to see what they could get. And now it's men all the time. Gawd, I hate 'em all, every mother's son of 'em! Don't you?  Oh, I dunno. There's good ones and bad ones, kid. You've just had a run of bad luck with 'em, that's all. Your Old Man, now--old Chris--he's a good one.  He'll have to show me.  Yuh kept right on writing him yuh was a nurse girl still, even after yuh was in the house, didn't yuh?  Sure. Not that I think he'd care a darn.  Yuh're all wrong about him, kid, I know Old Chris well for a long time. He's talked to me 'bout you lots o' times. He thinks the world o' you, honest he does.  Aw, quit the kiddin'!  Honest! Only, he's a simple old guy, see? He's got nutty notions. But he means well, honest. Listen to me, kid-- Ssshh!  What's up?  Py golly, Larry, dat grub taste good. Marthy in back?  Sure--and another tramp with her. [CHRIS starts for the entrance to the back room.]  That's him now. He's comin' in here. Brace up!  Who?  Why hello, Old Chris. Come here. I wanta tell yuh somethin'. Listen! I'm goin' to beat it down to the barge--pack up me duds and blow. That's her in there--your Anna--just come--waitin' for yuh. Treat her right, see? She's been sick. Well, s'long! S'long, kid. I gotta beat it now. See yuh later.$$$Well, but you're the quiet one,surely! Glory be to God, I'd not know a soul was alive in the room, barrin' myself. What is it you're at, Mary, that there's not a word out of you?  I'm looking at the pictures.  It's the dead spit and image of your sister Eileen you are, with your nose always in a book; and you're like your mother, too, God rest her soul.It's Nora and Tom has the high spirits in them like their father; and Billy, too,--if he is a lazy, shiftless divil--has the fightin' Carmody blood like me. You're a Cullen like your mother's people. They always was dreamin' their lives out.There's no good in too many books, I'll tell you. It's out rompin' and playin' with your brother and sister you ought to be at your age, not carin' a fig for books. Is that auld fool of a doctor stayin' the night? If he had his wits about him he'd know in a jiffy 'tis only a cold has taken Eileen, and give her the medicine. Run out in the hall, Mary, and see if you hear him. He may have sneaked away by the front door.  He's upstairs. I heard him talking to Eileen.  Close the door, ye little divil! There's a freezin' draught comin' in. It's mad I am to be thinkin' he'd go without gettin' his money--the like of a doctor! Rogues and thieves they are, the lot of them, robbin' the poor like us! I've no use for their drugs at all. They only keep you sick to pay more visits. I'd not have sent for this bucko if Eileen didn't scare me by faintin'.  Is Eileen very sick, Papa?  If she is, it's her own fault entirely--weakenin' her health by readin' here in the house. This'll be a lesson for her, and for you, too. (_Irritably._) Put down that book on the table and leave it be. I'll have no more readin' in this house, or I'll take the strap to you!  It's only pictures.
