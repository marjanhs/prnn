EE014	0	﻿ Cause document A disturbing and, in my view, a democratically threatening trend in Swedish society today is the decrease in general election participation. The number of registered voters that use their vote has dropped from 90.7% in 1979 to as little as 81.4% in the 1999 election, (www.riksdagen.se). This means that approximately one out of five Swedes do not take advantage of the fundamental democratic right to vote. In my experience Swedish people in general are not interested in discussing party politics and among younger adults it seems to be terribly out of fashion to do so. In the latter circles it does not seem to be a question of not having an opinion, but rather that those opinions do not fit under the party political system. Since I am still a great believer in the democratic party system I will take this opportunity to explore some of the possible causes for the low interest in party politics as well as its consequence - the falling number of voters. When discussing politics in general I have found that most Swedes, whether they have used their vote or not, appear to feel that they cannot really make a difference. This sense of not being able to influence may have grown out of the fact that Sweden has been led by a number of different parties during the last couple of centuries, and the difference between them has not been that great. Another factor could be the Swedish electoral system which makes it quite difficult for one single party to gain complete majority, i.e. total control. This is one of the reasons for the fairly stable running of Sweden, however, it seems that more and more Swedes find it hard to tell the different parties apart. A further possible explanation to the nonchalant attitude towards voting may be that the Swedish people have become very used to living in a democracy. Therefore they have difficulties seeing the importance of being active in the voting process as a way to protect the democratic system as such. Hopefully this attitude will change now that we actually have a potential threat to our democracy through the steadily growing nazi-movement. Even so, this does not explain why the decrease in voting participation has not happened earlier. One possible explanation to why the drop in election participation has happened now could be the political issues discussed today. Since society as a whole has become much more complex in its social and economical structure the political issues discussed have become quite abstract to the common man. Politics today are not just a question of ideology where your instincts can guide you, but a jungle of information with which you need to keep yourself informed to be able to partake in the political debate. The fact that so many Swedes join non-party political organizations like Greenpeace, which only deal with certain issues and in that way become more tangible, would support this thesis. The low participation in the last EU election also points in the same direction. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to be updated on every political issue today - to distinguish right from wrong - and this may very well explain this downward trend of participation in party politics. Apparently Swedish voters are not the only ones having difficulty making the distinction between right and wrong. Swedish politicians have been involved in several embarrassing scandals where the tax payers money have been used in a wrongful way - paying for private parties, licquer, visits to brothels and so on. It has become evident that several of these government officials do not practice what they preach. Even though this may not be a new phenomenon it is not until recent years that their less attractive traits and stupid actions have been exposed by the media and therefore become known to the public. This of course, have damaged the trust towards them in a huge way and many Swedes feel cheated out of the equal society they thought they lived in. When discussing the decline of interest in party politics it is hard to single out one of the above causes as being the dominate one. They all play a big part in this downward trend but to what extent they have influenced different individuals is impossible for me to say. People obviously have different reasons for not using their vote, but as I mentioned there are some changes that may turn things around. If the nazi-movement continues to infiltrate our democracy people will probably take their democratic participation more seriously and feel that they really can make a difference - which is what democracy is all about.$$$﻿ GIRLS BEGIN TO DIET AT THE AGE OF SEVEN According to research a new trend is developing showing that more girls begin to diet earlier in life, some of them already at the age of seven. Klara Halvarsson is a researcher at Uppsala university. Her results prove that there are not more girls dieting today than five years ago, but those who start tend to be younger. In her interviews she found that ten percent of the first and second graders claimed that they were on a diet and that dieting is increasing most among girls between 9 and 13. This is a very disquieting trend since girls that are on close diets early in life are more likely to develop eating disorders which later on can lead to such illnesses as anorexia and bulimia. This shows us that something must be wrong in society. What makes children want to diet? ... One reason could be the inability to cope with a stressful environment. Children are not allowed to do things in their own speed of action. They are exposed to long demanding days starting with school in the morning followed by the after-school center in the afternoon. Even their spare time is often planned with activities. Children are not able to put limits for themselves in the same way as adults are nor do they have the ability to analyze what it is that make them feel stressed. Wanting to loose weight can be a way for girls to show that the world is out of their control. Another reason could be that girls are more often suffering from a lack of selfesteem. They do not demand as much attention from their teachers as boys do and they are often quiet. It is easy for teachers to forget about them and easy for these girls to feel neither heard nor seen. They feel as if they were invisible and cannot compete with their more confident class mates. These problems are important for both parents and teachers to be aware of and watch out for. But according to the research they are not the main causes for why girls start dieting at a lower age. ... The actual cause seems to be a combination of the idealized image of what girls should look like spread by the media and the influence dieting mothers have on their daughters. What is conveyed to young girls through magazines, commercials, tv shows and teenage popstars is that they must be thin and good looking in order to be accepted. Girls are bombarded with the message that having a beautiful body is necessary to succeed in life. Make-up and looks are very common topics of conversation even among the youngest schoolgirls. Negative feelings associated with the image girls have of their own bodies is even further reenforced if their mothers are either on or between diets most of the time. Since I am a mother myself and have a daughter at six it makes me think about what ideas I pass on to her. Perhaps it is about time to examine our thoughts before we decide whether we want to pass them on to our daughters or not. We might not be able to do much about the media but at least we are capable of changing ourselves and that seems to be as good a place as any to start if we wish to turn this negative trend.
EE306	0	﻿ The rich is getting richer while the poor are becoming more I can still remember the first time I encountered a beggar in Sweden. After all it was not such a long time ago. What I remember most clearly, though, was the indifference most passengers showed on the train. Until then I believed that Sweden was a country that always offered a shelter for the poor and the needy. Until then I believed that homelessness and begging was something that belonged to other countries. Now ten years later the trend is well established; the rich is getting richer while the poor are becoming more. Aftonbladet recently published an article, which stated that the number of people living on welfare has doubled the last ten years. The article also revealed that another thing that has doubled during that period is the income of the five thousand richest Swedes. This trend is unfortunately applicable in a global perspective. What are the underlying forces behind that development? Are they intentional or can they be blamed on a disastrous political failure? The answer is one the manifestations many. The capitalist system prevailing in the West has, in spite of the abundance of food and water in the world, repeatedly failed to remedy poverty in their own countries as well as in the developing countries. The lofty rhetoric from their leaders has little or nothing to do with the matters discussed inside the White House and the Westminster parliament. While Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, declares war on poverty. The percentage of the total GNP of the members of the EU going to social welfare has gradually been cut. From 28.6% in 1996 to 28.1% in 1997 to 27.7% in 1998 according to, Eurostat, the statistics bureau of the EU. We should be under no illusion that all nations are interested in fighting poverty. Shortly after W.W.2 George Kennan, head of the State Department Policy Planning Staff wrote on one of the key state papers PPS 23 "We can't afford the luxury of altruism... We should cease to talk about vague and unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratization." In UN's Human Development Report 1999 p.3 we can clearly see that the policy set out by the United States for the second half of the 20th century has been successful. "The income gap between the fifth of the world's people living in the richest countries and the fifth in the poorest was 30 to 1 in 1960, up to 60 to 1 in 1990 and 74 to 1 in 1997." These oppressive nations represent the interest of huge corporations which only concern is how to make more money. There is much truth in the saying "what's good for General Motors is good for America". In order to achieve cheap labor and cheap raw materials the abolition of poverty is highly undesirable. A second significant reason and necessity for the gap to continue widening is that people are ignorant or unaware of the situation of the world. The main apparatus to screen off the public from the truth is the media. There is a sector of the media called the elite media or the agenda setting media. It is called the agenda setting media because it sets the framework in which all other media operates. The elite media like the New York Times or Dagens Nyheter are major, very profitable, corporations owned by much bigger corporations like General Electric or the Bonnier sphere. They are way up at the top of the power structure of the private economy. And it would be very surprising if they went against their own interests. For these huge corporations it's better that the public is concerned with professional sports or sex scandals than worrying about that one out of seven human beings are starving in the world. They prefer that we leave those serious questions for the big guys. Not even schoolbooks are free from that indoctrination. To create a market for the corporations, materialism was invented. And the way to spread its message is through advertising. The advertising industry glorifies the materialist to heavenly highs and plants the seed for future greed. Thus assuring that the masses are kept in bondage by the chains of greed. And as generations grow up they embark indoctrinated and often well intentioned on the capitalist roundabout. From once being victims of greed they have succumbed to become servants of greed. The vicious cycle is complete. To sum up the industrial countries are culpable of intentionally keeping 15% of the world population in extreme poverty while accumulating material wealth for themselves. The big corporations are the prime movers in the impoverishment process. And their highly sufficient media apparatus indoctrinates the citizens to not only accept the uneven distribution of wealth but also to strive for material wealth themselves. Furthermore, greed is the eye of the capitalist hurricane. It is the core to all major actions that broadens the gap between the rich and the poor. And like a hurricane, it's in its nature to destroy everything that stands in its way. Including the raising of living standards.$$$﻿ Would anybody agree to be slaughtered in the name of art? Lars Holger Holm's article in "Finanstidningen" is surely aimed to raise a debate and agitate or shock the average reader. Unfortunately, it is clumsily written and it is difficult to follow, due to its illogical and incoherent argumentation. Since the content is so controversial, Holm should have put some more effort in making his stance clear. As it is now, it is impossible to interpret the content in any other way than as a defence for pederasts, on the condition that they are talented enough. I also object to the irrelevant use of pregnant words and hyperboles meant to stealthily induce the feelings he wants the reader to feel. That is an obvious sign of his lack of sufficient arguments for his cause. And what is the cause? The heading "The outcasts are silenced" is followed by the introductory text "Imagine if it was possible to eradicate all perversions of the human race. Would not that in itself be the worst of all perversions?" But that is not what is being discussed. At least I can find no argument to support that thesis. What Holm asserts is firstly that the odd individual is rejected in society. That is true, at least when it comes to homeless, mentally ill, drug addicts, and prostitutes. A lot more could be done to improve their situation. But instead of mentioning them, Holm brings out the psychopaths and the pederasts on one end of the scale, and the geniuses on the other. That comparison is the spine of the whole article, but I can't see the similarity. A true genius' life and perception is totally unconnected to that of a psychopath. The geniality in a person is not in itself colliding with the values of society, and geniality does not necessarily make people outcasts. Holm describes how "the citizens voluntarily understand that they must restrict themselves from mental intercourse with the odd individual", implying that that the conform masses do not have an opinion of their own. When talking about psychopaths, it is a rather strange remark. One of the most basic desires of the human being is to avoid pain, threats, and death, and one does not need to be indoctrinated by a repressive government to stay away from people that may harm you. From the general pity of the social outcasts, Holm arrives at one, according to Holm, particular ambiguous case. A conductor in New York has been fired for perennial child abuses, even though he generously compensated the victims economically. Holm asks: "Should we in the future be prepared to sacrifice a person who deprave our children and youths... irrespective of the other, possibly indisputable, talents he has?", and we are also told to remember that Sokrates was accused for the same thing. The statement Holm makes in the form of a leading question suggests that it should be acceptable to exploit and abuse weaker human beings, to possibly destroy their confidence and traumatise their own sexuality for a lifetime, on the condition that the perpetrator is talented enough, worthy enough, and important enough. That is a disgusting outlook on mankind, and it leaves a bad taste in its resemblance with the Nazi ideology. Who decides which persons are worthy, and which are worthless and unnecessary to protect? The use of the word 'deprave' instead of 'hurt', 'abuse', or 'injure', endow the sentence with the alarming sense of Holm being unable to understand that victims of sexual abuse suffer to a incomparable extent; many child victims testify that they never could have an normal relation with someone, and suicide is not uncommon. That is a popular aberration among child rapists too: that the children is not affected by the rape, and in one way or another agrees to have sex with the perpetrator. Holm is able argue in this way only because he knows he probably would not be the victim. Would he agree to be slaughtered in the name of art? Lars Holger Holm is either mentally disturbed, or totally incompetent in conveying his own opinions. Either way, it is embarrassing that a serious paper like Finanstidningen should publish an article like this. Maybe it was meant to be brave, and sometimes it is good to start a debate on sensitive topics, but they should have asked a person able to write articles with a content worthy of discussion. Summary: The outcasts are silenced Lars Holger Holm, Finanstidningen den 5/4 -01 Thesis: It is smug and wrong to punish odd individuals like pederasts without considering his other talents. The collective moral tenet should not dictate the conditions for the odd and socially offensive, but creative, person. To eradicate all perversions of the human race would in itself be the worst of all perversions. Summary: The concept "a normal individual" is a new construction but probably most communities have defined clearly which traits that characterises the valuable citizen and the outcast. The outcasts do not submit to the social and cultural duties that the governing masters impose on them, as the normal citizen does. The government allege that they are protecting the citizens from each other (by laws etc.), but in reality it is a disguise to find means to protect them from the enlightenment that the odd individuals conveys to them. Society makes people to voluntarily distance themselves from the outcasts, who are looked upon as enemies to society. The concept that society would be better of without pederasts and geniuses is widespread, as an important step in the destruction of the odd elements in society. Some of our greatest minds are socially unacceptable persons. One of the greatest conductors in the United States has assaulted several young boys. He has "mitigated the consequences of his side-steps" with abundant economic compensations. But unluckily he didn't see the "need to repress his natural impulses". Now he has got a notice to quit from the Metropolitan Opera in N.Y. Should we sacrifice a true genius on the base that they deprave our youth? Should the majority collective moral tenet dictate the conditions for the odd and socially offensive, but creative, person? Wouldn't be the worst of all perversions to eradicate all perversions of the human race?
EE013	0	﻿ Why do Swedish Women Wait with Having Children until their Thirties? Today it seems that the Swedish woman waits longer and longer to have children; this is a development which has come to a visible peak in the 1990s when it is common that women are 30 or even 40 years old when they have their first child. Comparing to women of earlier periods of the 20th century women of today have greater freedom to choose when they want to have their first child, that is because they are more independent, both socially and economically. Women of today do not have the same pressure to settle down, as earlier, they do not have to marry and have children to secure her future wellbeing. Instead of having to stay at home with their children, like their grandmothers did, women of the 1980s and 90s have the opportunity, and also the pressure, to educate themselves and get a career. There are a lot of causes for this development of having children at a high age, and I will in this essay give some possible reasons which may have changed the views and the lifestyle of the contemporary Swedish woman. In the beginning of the century, the place of the woman was in the house, and not in the man's world of work. She was supposed to take care of the children (as well as the husband), and had a lot of demands from family, husband and society. In those years women could not choose their own way of life and when married, they often had their first babies at an early age, partially because there were no contraceptives, which there are today. This was just as natural to them, as it is for us today that we can choose when we want to have children. Today there is a different attitude towards women and the ideal of a woman has changed significantly since our grandmothers were young. The word 'woman' does no longer have the same meaning as 'wife' and 'mother', as it might have had earlier - it now has a meaning of an independent human being with the same rights as a man. Women are now given a more important role in society and can enjoy the possibility of creating their own happiness, whether it is with children or not. I think most women want, and need, to explore the world around them a bit more, before they commit themselves to a baby and they probably find support for this from their mothers and grandmothers, who were not able to choose. Not to forget they also have to find a suitable partner/father, as "it takes two to tango", and this might seem like an almost impossible task as the rate of divorces is awfully high nowadays. Furthermore, most women cannot rely on being taken cared of by men anymore; they have to build their own social status, whether they like it or not. Like in many other countries the pace of life in Sweden is fast, and anyone who wants to succeed in life has to get a higher education, which demands many years of study to get good job and a career. And after the long education they obviously have to find employment, where they have to stay for a longer period to make sure they have their position secured, if in the future they would like to have a baby. There have been some employment cases where women have been rejected a position because of their intention of having children in the future, and some have also been refused to come back to their jobs after the maternity leave. Having this in mind, it is not difficult to understand the women's decision to wait with children. I myself am a young woman and if I will ever have a child I will wait until I am sure I have all the necessary prerequisites for bringing up a child; a solid economic ground, a satisfying education and job, a suitable home, etc. In the 1990s the pressure and opportunities of a Swedish woman are different than women of earlier periods, and she seems to be more focused on getting an education and a good job than a good child. The child question has become a practical issue, and there is a lot of consideration to do before a woman can decide to have a child, i.e. she has to have a good ground for bringing up a child, financial issues, career issue, etc. And when she eventually realises she can and wants to have a baby, she is probably already about 35-40 years old and founds her biological clock ticking away.$$$﻿ Politics and Education On numerous occasions during the last couple of years it has been argued that the Swedish school system is not working sufficiently. Many debates dealing with the school system have taken place and a number of changes aiming at improvement have been made. In an article on this topic two Swedish politicians present the Swedish Folkpartiet's view on today's school system, and what changes they consider necessary to make the Swedish school "the best in Europe". If giving reports is a good thing and, if so, at what age students should begin recieving them are two main issues dealt with in the article. The opinion put forward, which I certainly agree with, is that reports are an important part of a working school system and that these reports should be given at an early stage in the eduction. One important question when discussing reports is that of why it is so essential to do evaluations.. To decide whether a system is working sufficiently or not it has to be evaluated, and when evaluating something one has to be prepared for both positive and negative results. It is important though, not to be afraid of getting bad results. To be able to solve a problem one has to identify it; finding a problem is the first step towards a solution. This also applies to giving reports to students. Through evaluating students and their skills one can detect problems that might exist and come to terms with them. Unfortunately, in the Swedish school system, evaluation has got an ugly ring to it. In aiming for equality between students it has been emphasised that all students should learn the exact same thing. In practice this is of course impossible since all students are different and talented to different degrees. It is inevitable that some children will learn less than others. Although this is something every mature individual realises, it still seems as a fact many choose to pretend does not exist. One way of doing this is to simply not evaluate students. By avoiding evaluation the risk of getting any negative results on paper is abolished and no student has to worry about being pointed out as poorly talented in any subject. The thing forgotten though, is that no positive results are identified either, and in the long run some students will probably be shocked by their short-comings. Where the existence of reports in the Swedish school system is concerned, the article states that it is essential. Furthermore it is argued that the reports should be in written form, not verbal as they to a great extent are today. Getting a report card which clearly states how things are going for you in a specific subject is of great importance. I believe that for both the individual student and his or her parents this is a concrete way of finding out how things are working, or perhaps not working, in school. Of course, it could be argued that this information might as well be told verbally by the teacher and still have the same effect. However, the important difference is that a written report is a more direct way of knowing; it clearly states if you have done well or badly in a subject. In addition, when something is written down on paper it is more likely to be taken seriously than if it is verbally communicated. In my opinion evaluation is a very important aspect of a school system when it comes to identifying problems and coming to terms with them. With this in mind it should be obvious that it is important to get this type of feedback at quite an early stage. If problems are identified in time the chance to solve them is of course greater. In the article it is argued that the fifth grade is a proper age to start giving reports and that the eighth grade, when the first report is given today, is far too late. It seems probable that if a student in eighth grade, a fourteen-year-old, is made aware that he or she is doing poorly in school it is not likely that a sudden interest in improving the skills necessary will appear. Consequently, it would be better to start giving reports earlier in order to make students aware of their strengths and weaknesses in due time. This way they are given more time to solve possible problems and maybe even a chance to prevent them from arising. The fact that all children are different and have different strengths and weaknesses is perhaps the most important one when dealing with the constitution of a school system. The school exists for the children who attend it and consequently every aspect of it should be adjusted to them. They should all be given the opportunity to develop as best they can, and they should have equal chances to succeed. The crucial point, though, is that allowing children to develop equally is not the same as making them into copies of each other. Equality in school is to help students who have problems to learn how to deal with them and to encourage gifted students to keep up the good work. And the right way to go about this is to evaluate students and to do it early.
EE394	1	﻿ "The fifth child", by Doris Lessing I have read the novel, "The fifth child", by Doris Lessing; and I will discuss the theme of the novel; and also whether the setting is important to the theme or not. I will refer to certain pages when I discuss these questions, and the pages 28-31, will be very important. I will begin with the setting of the novel, and then move on to discussing the theme. The plot of the novel takes place in England, in a suburb to London. When the novel begins the year is 1965. Almost twenty years passes, and the novel ends in the beginning of the 80's. That means it starts out during the time of "love, peace and understanding", when people had a lot of hopes for the future. As the novel progresses, the times are changing. As we can see on page 29, the good times have gone. People start loosing their jobs, criminality is increasing and the world is becoming a scary place, where the cliffs between the rich and the poor are growing immensely wide. When turning to page 30, we can see that the Lovatt family, who are the main characters in the novel, as you know, are trying to protect their happiness by wanting to shield themselves from the scary world outside their fortress. Now, let us look into the social background of the setting. England was at this time very class-bound; and the norms that influenced the families, were the norms of he middle and upper classes. The extreme and the different was simply not acceptable, everybody was to live comfortably and in harmony, with nothing sticking out from the ordinary. David comes from a split-up upper class family. His mother and her new husband are both academics. His father is very wealthy, as well as the father's new wife. Harriet is also well educated, but her family seems to come from a "lower" social background than David's. When the fifth child was born, he did not fit in at all in the family or in the society; and therefore caused a crisis to which there was no solution, in many ways because of the setting that is intimately connected to the theme. The main theme of the novel, from my point of view, is what happens to the happy family when the fifth child is conceived. How Harriet goes against the norms of the upper and middle classes; and how the fifth child himself, and his gang, revolt against a society that has no room for them. Harriet and David's happiness is fragile. They are very eager to be happy, and are not prepared for anything bad ever happening to them, starting out as they do with the sense that anything is possible. Moreover, their happiness has been built up relying on others for financial support, paying for their life in the fortress of their house, coming from David's father and his wife, as well as help with the children, coming from Harriet's mother. They wanted to make a brake with the spirit of the times, as we can see at page 29, "the greedy and selfish sixties", but they do not really succeed. The theme reflects how a family can cope with the pressure put upon them by having a disturbed child, living in a society where there is no room for a disturbing element such as the fifth child, Ben. At page 31, we can see David saying like this: "... everyone should have a room. Now, this is far from true, as David does not want to have anything to do with Ben. Molly says the same thing only we understand she does not mean what she says, which symbolises her values. The family falls apart and the only one who stands up for what is right, is Harriet, who gets blamed by every member of the family as well as by all the relatives. Harriet cannot except having her son rotting away at the institution; (an institution which very much reflects society's way of not giving room for people in need of help) and therefore she needs to go against the norms and sets of values within her family and with in the society. That is a society where the higher classes and the rich are in control, making little room for the less fortunate individuals, as I have already discussed when writing about the setting. By doing this she pretty much looses her whole family, who are unable to accept her decision. Ben, on the other hand, who really brakes with the norms of society, does actually find a room for himself among the other not socially accepted boys. In order to sum up these thoughts, I will now write a small conclusion concerning my main points. An abnormal child is born, which causes a crisis in the family. The family cannot handle the pressure this put upon them; and what makes it extra difficult are the norms that exist in the society, and within the family. These norms do not make room for individuals who are too different, or who have problems adjusting to the normal way of living. The scattering of the family is due to the society in which they live.$$$﻿ My strengths and weaknesses in the English language Ten years after finishing high school, I am now to study English again. This time on a much higher level. It is time to evaluate what my strengths and weaknesses are. Listening In general I'm a good listener. For instance, while listening to a lecturer, I don't have a problem to focus on what is being said (unless the person I'm listening to makes the subject really boring, or when I'm very tired), and I usually understand the lot. My weakness is my small vocabulary. I think I scored about average on the diagnostic test I took on vocabulary. Since I did a lot of guessing, picking out the right words, it is reasonable to assume that my vocabulary is even below average. I enjoy watching English movies and I pick up on the language just by listening to it when I make the effort not to look at the subtitles. And of course by reading, which is what the next part in this essay is about. Reading I like to read novels for the fun of it, but also other sorts of literature about various kinds of matters. Therefore I believe the literature course and the social studies will be easier for me than other courses. My weakness in this course is, once again, my lack of vocabulary. It slows down my reading a great deal, but the pace will increase the more I read, as well as my vocabulary. I think I'm fairly good when it comes to interpreting novels, short stories and poems. My strengths are the fact that I enjoy reading and that I usually understand the content, irony and humour. Speaking y strength when it comes to speaking English is that I'm not afraid to make mistakes. I'm here to learn and of course I'm not perfect from the start. Moreover, I believe that my speaking ability will improve rather quickly once I start practising on a daily basis. I find the rhythm of the language and the accent, more difficult to learn than the pronunciation is. I am very rusty though, I haven't spoken English since high school, like I said, and then it was almost just about answering questions. The problem is that there is a limitation to what I can talk about with my present vocabulary, and that I don't have the right intonation. Writing y writing skills are very difficult to evaluate; I don't really know what my strengths and weaknesses are. I know that I can't be that good at it, since my vocabulary is limited and my knowledge in grammar is bad. I think that grammar is very tricky, it is probably my number one weakness. I have some advantage though, since I studied Swedish grammar last year. My ability to focus on a subject is fairly good, but it can become better. I've written a lot in Swedish and maybe that is also an advantage to some extent. I find it rather difficult to write this essay and I imagine it will be even harder when I have an intricate subject to write about. My strength would be my ambition to learn and trying to get it right. Conlusion To bring this essay to an end, I will now summarise my different strengths and weaknesses in the English language. My lack of vocabulary has a negative effect on all parts of the language. My difficulty with grammar naturally has a negative effect when it comes to writing and in some ways speaking. (Needless to say it will give me a lot of work at the grammar course). I am not accustomed to speaking English, which of course will make it difficult from the beginning. My strengths are my faculty to learn languages and my ambition to do so. I hope that I will be able to transfer my writing skills in Swedish to my writing in English. My interest in reading will help me through the continuous work increasing my vocabulary, as my general interest in English will help me through all courses.
EE018	1	﻿ BE WARY OF THE NEWS According to an estimation from 1990, the average Swede watches about 50,000 hours of television during a lifetime. This is as much as 30 years of full time work with today's working hours. Consequently, it is vital to be critical of what we are watching. One of television's tasks is to transmit news, and it is tempting to believe that what is communicated is the important events in the world, and that those are impartially conveyed to us. It is important to bear in mind that this is not always the case. To begin, the news is produced by people with values, prejudices, and various outlooks. They choose to present specific events in the world and give them news value. Thus, the news is interpretations of what the world looks like at a specific moment, and often the news comes across as objective and true. To further clarify, a piece of news given to us in Sweden might be put forward from a completely different angle, in another country's newscast. Also, what is news to us might not even be mentioned in another country. When visiting the Emirates I was reminded of this. There the news mainly dealt with events in that part of the world, and Europe seemed distant and only scattered news items occurred. This implies that we tend to consider what is happening closer to us as more important. We are not as emotionally affected by an earth quake in India, or even in Istanbul, as we would be if it happened in a European country that we could more easily relate to. For my part I was filled with fear though, on hearing about the severe earth quake that took many lives in Istanbul, but I lived there and have a connection to that country. Thus, events that occur at places we are emotionally attached to, affect us more, since we can relate to them, and they appear more real. Media take advantage of this though, and have a way of reinforcing this feeling. To exemplify, if we go back five years, to when the Estonia sank, many of us probably remember Kent and Sara who struggled together and survived the terrible ordeal. That night they decided that if they survived they would go out for dinner together. This became a tear-jerking story, which took us all to the ship that awful night. Is is of course an ingenious way of catching and holding our attention, but we need to be aware of the fact that we only get to taste what is happening out there, and that events are often distorted through what the reporter says, through different shooting angles, and through editing. Moreover, news is turning more and more into entertainment. It is no wonder, since it has to compete with the growing and fast spreading entertainment television. By being fun, thrilling, or exciting, news aims to reach us. Especially young people of today easily get bored and their attention span is very short. In order to create interest, newsmakers have been forced to change their way of conveying news. There are so many channels nowadays to select between that watching the news is hardly a first choice. It is sad that society doesn't take this more seriously. If children and adolescents are not encouraged and spurred on to concentrate on more serious matters than entertainment, they will surely bump into problems and situations in the future that they don't know how to handle. Furthermore, I would like to point out the fact that specific groups tend to be portrayed in different ways on the news. Politicians, for example, hold a prominent position in media. They show a standard behaviour, considered normal for that group. They rarely show human traits like happiness or anger, and when it does occur, the feelings are very contained. Top politicians need not even have anything of importance to convey. They can talk about the weather, or simply state that they have nothing in particular to say. Moreover, young people are often presented among startling events like crimes or accidents. Inventive youths who are active in theatre, music or sports are also shown. Occasionally they appear in connection with social issues, like unemployment. Then they can say if they are angry, worried or unhappy. But there are always some experts that analyse and say what they actually feel. Another group that we see little of is old people. When they do appear, we either pity and feel sorry for them, or they come across as a big bunch of complainants, worrying about low pension or bad care at the old people's homes. Sometimes though, elderly people are shown as individuals. Then they exhibit traits of cheerfulness, and are put forward as active and good old age people. To conclude, it is important to realise that television has great power and that we must be wary and critical of what the news intends to convey and in what way it does so, since it really isn't impartial and rarely tells the whole truth!$$$﻿ THE RIGHT SIDE THERE SHOULD BE MORE EMPHASIS ON ARTISTIC SUBJECTS AT SCHOOL ost mental and physical abilities change and develop as people grow. It is a salient feature in our schoolsystem that a great deal is done to cultivate skills such as reading, writing and arithmetics. However, the development of artistic skills seems to come to a stop at quite an early age. Many grown-ups stay at a 14-year-old-level when it comes to expressing themselves artistically. One of the reasons why schools favour the more theoretical subjects is that it is a prevalent notion that what you learn in arts classes is of little use in daily life, which is not true! Firstly, in art classes we deal with the fact that we live in a world where we are drowned with impressions and images such as advertisements, commercials, musicvideos and news-images from various media. Commercials are often flashy, entertaining and inventive. But their purpose is to make us buy things and they do not reflect the society we live in today. Not even the daily news gives us a correct image of the world. People with values, ideas and prejudice choose events and make us think that these are the major happenings in the world, when in fact these images are interpretations of what the world looks like at a certain moment. Often newsflashes come out as objective and true, so it is vital to be critical and to understand images and their connotations and not just perceive them as the "truth". Moreover, according to experts' research the brain is divided into two parts - the left and the right. Reading, writing and arithmetics are skills that are usually located in the left hemisphere of the brain. This part is also considered as dominant and even tends to take over tasks which are more suitable for the right side of the brain to handle. The right hemisphere is generally seen as the subordinate one. It is alotted artistic abilities, thus good at things like music, drawing, creativity and perception. All these knacks seem somewhat forgotten in our schools, and although they are valued they are considered to be a natural result from using ones verbal and analytical skills. However, I will argue that this is not the case and that we need specifically to cultivate the right side of our brain, something that is hardly possible to do during one sixty-minute-lesson of art once a week. People in general are of the opinion that the ability to draw or perform other artistic activities is something that a minority of people are gifted with and if you can't already draw there is no use in trying to learn. It is like deciding not to learn a foreign language because you can't already speak it. Actually, the difficulty to draw lies rather in learning how to observe or being able to switch over to a particular way of seeing. From the time we grow up we are used to seeing things through words; a cat, an apple, a tree and so on. Consequently, the left side of the brain is activated and tends to put things into categories and to symbolise things. We all have a symbol for a face, an eye or a house, but this is not what they really look like. To draw is a process which demands careful observation and meticulous perception of details and all kinds of information. This can be trained in a number of ways and the trick is to give the brain a task which the left hemisphere either doesn't know how to perform or doesn't want to perform. This demands a lot of concentration. For example, you can study an up-side-down-image without having seen it the correct way first and try and draw what you see. When you focus on how the lines meet instead of what the image actually represents the left side becomes confused and since it can't compare the information to any stored memories it leaves the task to the more suitable right side. The majority of people are not aware of the fact that we actually neglect one side of the brain and its' capacity. Thus, the school has a huge responsibility in conveying the importance of exploring our whole brain, not just a part of it. What is more, the left and the right side of the brain actually cooperate in several areas. Psychologists, for example, use drawing as a method to release and understand hidden emotions. A drawing from the heart can be of immense help when solving an emotional problem and revealing what you actually feel. When the right side of the brain has shown the left side what the problem is the left side can solve the problem through language and logical thinking. In conclusion, to fully function as human beings there is a need for the revaluation of artistic skills and perception. Today the schoolsystem rewards the skills of the left side of the brain to such an extent that much of our childrens' inherent opportunities of the right side will stay undeveloped.
EE392	1	﻿ Is television dangerous for children? Is television dangerous for children? This is a question that has been discussed frequently for the last few years when the offering of television channels has increased explosive. Many people have probably reflected on questions like if we should protect the children from violence and if children can see the difference between video violence and real violence on the daily news. I think these questions actually don't have easy answers, but they are interesting to think about. Nowadays many films and television programs on TV are very violent. Video- and computer games can as well be very violent and nevertheless films on cinema. Today many Swedish families pay for cable channels that give a broad offering of channels day and night. Since the television channels have increased, more and more people are watching television. This is probably a reason for that people have started to discuss television violence. And many parents have probably thought this matter out and considered not letting their children watch everything on the television since they believe that it has a deleterious effect. In Sweden some animated films and series for children have actually been criticised for being too violent and shut off from Swedish television. Of course at many children's disappointment but at some parent's delight. But is television dangerous then? Should children be kept away from the fictive violence or even from the violence on the news? One possible risk with TV that has been discussed is that the children may imitate the violent people they see on TV. Most children at least identify themselves with the hero who takes action for good purposes and that may even learn them something good. I agree that television sometimes can be very violent and in many films shooting, fights etc. are what the whole thing amounts to. Considering this I don't believe that it could be stimulating or even fun to look at for any child. So I am of the opinion that we certainly need the censorship to avoid violent programs. On the other hand I think that most children know what is fictive. One positive way to look at this is that the children can conceal themselves behind the fact that this isn't real and that all these terrible things are only fictive. In that case violence wouldn't cause much fear among children. And the "real" violence on the news is actually something that can happen in reality. Children may understand this better than we think. And what create insecurity among children, real or fictive violence? If we shut off the children from the news then it would be like giving a polarised picture of the society. Anyhow, I don't think this is a big problem since most children not are interested in news programs for adults. I think it is impossible to keep children away from television violence. The responsibility can not only be put on the television channels but also on the parents who actually have a very big part of the responsibility. As a parent or a teacher I think that the best thing to do is to talk about violence and explain why they use violence and the results of it. And if television is the main thing that triggers off the violence in the society we have a very hard thing to deal with. So we probably have to ask ourselves once again if there is a danger with watching television. And most important of all is to make children understand that using of violence is totally wrong.$$$﻿ "The new order of things proposed": Vision and Reality in Robert Owen's New Lanark and New Harmony. The Welsh manufacturer Robert Owen made several community experiments in the early 19th century. Two of them were the experiments in New Lanark, Scotland, and New Harmony, Indiana, in the U.S. New Lanark was Owen's first social experiment where he made a village with a cotton mill into a model community. New Harmony was a later attempt of Owen to create a self-contained community. In this essay I will present important aspects of these two experiments in order to compare them. In the early 1800's the Welshman Robert Owen, who was a partner in a Manchester firm, became a manager of the New Lanark mill in Lanarkshire in Scotland. Owen was confronted with bad living conditions as well as bad working conditions in the factory. Child labour was very common, theft was extensive, the workers had poor housing conditions in squalid surroundings and there was no education for children. Owen immediately turned the little village with the cotton mill as a nucleus into a "welfare program". Owen improved many conditions such as the workers' food, clothes, houses and the cleanliness in the factory. He prevented drunkenness by starting to sell alcohol under strict control. Best known is that he started an education for children. Owen agreed that all these improvements in New Lanark would promote the productivity of the cotton mill and thus the improvements fostered efficiency at the same time as they composed a type of social reform. Naturally the improvements of the community entailed expenses but Owen maintained that this would make the mill more profitable. Owen's main philosophy was that man's character is formed in early childhood, not by himself, but for him, and only by the environment. To create a good character man should be placed under good influences in the early years. Owen further believed that society had a responsibility to offer good living conditions and education for the people. By improving many bad conditions in New Lanark he offered the workers a better life. Owen agreed that he had changed the character of the New Lanark inhabitants by his alterations. The fact is that Owen didn't intend to change the New Lanark mill's basic character but he wanted to create new, better conditions in the mill. The children who were brought up in New Lanark were generally healthy and respected. The mill in New Lanark was very productive and became a success and a model community. New Lanark was consequently a mill that Owen turned into a community, which is in contrast to one of his later social experiments, New Harmony, which was rather a planned Utopia to which Owen gathered a number of people in order to put his theories, both social and economic, into practice. In this project Owen followed a new economic plan that he emphasised, where the size of the community was important from the point of view of production. In 1825 Owen bought a great piece of land in Indiana which he renamed New Harmony. His plan was to create a self-contained community, intending that the people would be self-supporting, producing their own products together with other co-operative villages. Owen believed that there was a special number of people (about 1200 persons) who could live in the community in order to keep it self-contained. Many activities in the community, such as eating and cooking, would be collective. Before the start Owen invited "the industrious and well disposed of all nations" to come to this community and be inhabitants. Many of those who came didn't turn out to be as willing to learn as the New Lanark inhabitants. The community soon ran into difficulties since people were at odds about the form of government and the role of religion. New Harmony was consequently a failure and didn't last long. Owen withdrew from the project in 1828. New Harmony was thus intended to be a model community which could live on its own and offer work to unemployed and people without housing. In this case Owen turned to more general problems of society. An aspect of this was to cure pauperism and unemployment. This was in comparison to New Lanark where more specific problems were in focus, such as improving factory conditions. However, both of the experiments were plans for social reorganisation, the later one being based on a self-supporting community. The social aspect was also apparent since Owen's experiments were focused on the lower classes of society. In his later experiment he wanted to decrease the widespread unemployment by setting up small communities; in New Lanark he improved the conditions for a number of lower-class people. Even if it was obvious that Owen was concerned with the economic aspects of his communities he always had in mind that man should have good living conditions. He believed that society had the responsibility to offer these conditions to the people. Since the factory is the dominant part in man's life it must be as good as possible so he can live in it, Owen maintained. However, his purpose of his experiments was upon the community and not on the individual. Owen's main philosophy, that man is formed by the environment and that he should be placed under a good influence, was something that he based all his work on. This was also something that Owen indeed tried to carry into effect by his social experiments. Happiness was a keyword for Owen's work: "The object of all human exertions is to be happy. Happiness cannot be attained, enjoyed and secured, unless all men possess health, real knowledge and wealth." 1 Owen experiments had a pragmatic way of working. He tried to form guidelines or propose reforms that would create a new social environment for lower class people. The fact is that his first attempt was a success while New Harmony didn't work in practice. 1 Letter from Robert Owen to London Newspapers, August 7, 1817
EE316	1	﻿ Children and violence on television After having been an exclusive entertainment for a few, television is now a natural part of most people's lives. Television programmes are no longer broadcasted between six and ten o'clock at night, but shown round the clock. We live with television and through television, dreaming ourselves away to other parts of the world, to different lives, to better lives, while watching romantic films and soap operas. We watch the news and let war, famine, flood and injustice in to our livingrooms, but do not allow ourselves to further reflections after that the news is over. We watch action movies, and see how the hero survives after being chased by both the maffia and the police forces, whose number naturally has been reduced with a few dozens. Afterwards we switch off the television and turn back to reality. At least we often think so. A question that has been widely discussed lately is how people and especially children are affected by what they see on television. An every day higher degree of violence in society is by many seen as an result of the violence shown on television. Others claim that it is the other way round: that television reflects the society we live in and that films and programmes containing violence only mirrors the real world. But even if violence on television is ment to show that evil actually exist, parents seems to agree in not wanting their children to discover this. Broadcasters are often accused of not taking their responsibility when it comes to the question about showing or not showing programmes containing violence. But it seems like they are taking their responsibility as far as possible, at least in the Swedish channels. Action films and programmes containing violence are most often telecasted on late viewing hours, when parents usually are at home and their children have gone to bed. During the hours children are most likely to watch television violence is seldom shown. Broadcasters are also taking their responsibility in the way they inform about the recommended age limit before a film starts. In the same way commentators and newscasters warn if programmes and news contain violent scenes. When it comes to the latter, it seems like there is a common acception not to show close-up pictures of people's suffering, or to detailed desciptions of victims of violence. This might not be an agreement for protecting only the children but rather to protect all viewers. Naturally the cautions that violence is to be shown are not useful if parents are not around. It is not likely that a child itself switch channel after a warning like this. Therefore it seems obvious that the biggest responsibility for controlling what children are watching should be incured by the parents. It is for these to decide whether or not they want their children to face the evil of the times. One problem is that of telling the difference between different types of violence. Parents must teach their children to distinguish between real violence and fiction violence. The dividing-line between them both is not always clear, and the task might therefore seem far to difficult to solve. How to explain for a child that the violence in 30 November actually exists, and that the message in Pulp Fiction not is that of bying a motor-cykle and start killing people on the streets. When is a child ready to face the true evil of the Second World War, and see a film like Schindler's List and at what age can one understand the underlying humour in Scream. These questions must be for each parents to think about, when raising their children. It is to be hoped that a parental responsibility taken when the children are still young, gives the basis for a sound attitude towards violence when they grow up.$$$﻿ Regulate the Swedish import of American films The United States has for a long time dominated the world's film production. The number of new American productions is constantly increasing, and many of its actors are well known all over the world. American culture and society has become part of many people's everyday life, in spite of the fact that they live in completely different countries. The youth of Japan might know more about the American school system, than about their own, as a result of the many hours spent in front of Beverly Hills. And if Europeans tend to know a lot about the judicial system, it is more likely about the American judicial system than their own, because of the large number of American successes dealing with laywers, as The Firm and Ally McBeal. In studios all over the world, native actors do their best to imitate the voices of American actors, with the aim to make the movies understandable to their compatriots. In the meanwhile, domestic productions are neglected, and non-american film producers find themselves struggling against a power, which is far too strong to challenge. In 1991 a resolution of the Swedish Riksdag regulated the number of American productions in the state's television channels, in order to promote both the domestic and the European film and television industry. The result has been a greater variaty in the programs, and the creation of many high-quality Swedish productions made for television. But for the Swedish film-industry the problem remains intact. The Riksdag resolution should therefore be extended to include this domain as well. A regulation of American movies imported by Swedish cinemas would result in a more fair competition for the filmgoers. Film as a medium is an effective way to disseminate ideas and knowledge about different cultures. With this as an aim, it is often used in the schools as an alternative to textbooks, giving the students a deeper and more nuanced knowledge than can be recieved only by reading or listening. While watching a foreign movie, the students are given the possibility to get an insight into a different country and its features, as well as into the everyday life of its inhabitants. In this way the film serves to increase the comprehension for other cultures and hopefully promotes a more positive attitude to immigrants and to the cultural diversity of our country. A regulation of the import of foreign movies would imply a reduced number of American films in favour of both Swedish and other non-american movies. This diversity at the cinemas would serve in the same way as in the schools, but reach out to more people. A regulation of the film-import would also be of great importance to Swedish producers and actors. By now only a few Swedish productions are up at the cinemas, because of the keen competition. Among the small number of films actually shown, many are seen only by a minority. A case in point is the film made by the Swedish producer Lisa Ohlin, Veranda fur en tenor, which was performed for the first time last summer. In spite of great and well known actors, a highly commended script and dazzling reviews, the film was shown only in a few cities and had a surprisingly small audience. This was the result of far too many bad experiences with similar films, which had been neglected by Swedish filmgoers, in order to favour one of the American productions instead. A regulation of the import would stimulate the Swedish film industry and give the native producers the opportunity to reach out to their audience. It would favour the cultural life of Sweden as well as promote more jobs. In the debate about a proposed regulation it has been claimed that a implementation of the same would conflict with the freedom of competition. It is true that the Swedish film industry then would not compete at the free market, and that a legalisation of regulation would be against the democratic rights. But what is even more dangerous for a small country like Sweden is actually the present situation; a situation where we find ourselves discriminated and brushed aside by a gigantic competitor, which nearly has a monopoly of the world's film production. For the individual the standardization of the present supply is a threat, even though it is a result of free competition and not of some totalitarian state's censorship. A regulation would serve to give the Swedes a greater possibility to choose on their own what kind of film they want to see. It is the only way to combat the present standardization and to recapture the control over an important domain of Swedish cultural life.
EE423	1	﻿ Who is to take care of your children? When the days of maternity leave are racing towards an end it is time to make up your mind. Who is to look after your child now? There are plenty alternatives: you could for example choose to continue staying at home or, if you are dying to get back to work, maybe start off with part time? Other options are day care centres or child minders. The decision might not be as easy as you first thought. In this short arguing essay I am going to deal with the different matters of child minding with the main question: Stay at home with your child or use day care centres. Of course there are not always as easy as to only make up your mind. Maybe you have only got one or two options due to the supply or the standards of day care in your area of living. Maybe you have relatives or friends who are willing to help you out or maybe it is as simple as this: you do not have any work to go back to. There are as a matter of fact innumerable ways to solve this problem. As I cannot deal with them all here and now I will return to my main question at issue: day care or house wife (man). To me the answer seems clear but I will try to give you some of my arguments. At a day care centre (which by the way sounds much more institutional than the Swedish word "dagis") the child will automatically learn to manage without "mummy and daddy" but still look forward to being picked up by the end of the day. It is more fun to come home and find your own toys and books after a day away from home. At day care the matters of sharing things and playing together with other children comes naturally and, from my point of view, this makes the child more outgoing and open minded. This, as well as the fact that the child gets used to trusting other adults, are very strong pro-day care arguments. Even though there are no doubts as to my own opinion I can understand people who argue staying at home with your child is the only right thing. I can understand their views but I do not fully agree. One might not think it is fair to a small child leaving her in someone else's care, away from home. The home is a protected and secure place for a child, yes, but what happens when one day it is time to go to school and mummy will no longer be there? Is that fair to your child? Another point is that if you stay at home with your child you will get a better understanding and contact with her, being able to follow her every move and achievement. I agree but only because you do not see your little ones for seven hours it does not mean you are missing out on their childhood or that you are being a bad parent. You still have lots of time to spend with your child. When it comes to seeing other children one might argue a mother (or father of course) can attend lots of activities with the child were other children are included and in that way introduce "playmates" to the child. It is not the same thing though, as learning to deal with friends and not-so-good-friends on your own in day care centres. That brings up another good thing about day care; they also do lot of activities such as going to swimming pools, theatres or simply different playgrounds. How fun for the children and how easy for you! Of course nobody should choose day care only because it is easy. You have to feel confident about someone else taking care of your precious child and you must not have bad conscience when you finally have made your mind up. Fortunately different solutions suit different people and we all have to accept that. You never know what will happen in the future but I might become a proud house wife. I just want to kill the myth about mothers being obliged to stay at home nursing children in stead of making a career. You do not have to make the choice between your children and your work, not with the exceptional day care facilities we have in Sweden today. It might sound like day care is "the hard way"; to find friends, taking turns, not getting all the attention but being one in the group and getting the help needed. The hard way so is it, but it will all come to use for the child in the future and in the end your child will be happier and more open.$$$﻿In this short essay I will try to give a brief outline of my knowledge and experience of the English language. I will assess my strengths and weaknesses in the four basic skills of speaking, reading, listening and writing. To make this easier to relate to I will start off with filling you in on some of my background details that has to do with English. I suppose I have always had a great interest in languages. In grade 7 to 9 I had an extremely good teacher who contributed with a lot of the enthusiasm I have for this language today. She was not a native speaker but no other languages than English were allowed in the classroom and she took her task of teaching very serious. After first year of Upper Secondary School I chose to take a break in my studies and go to England as an au pair. My year in London was superb and I learnt English almost without even trying. I attended two English courses during that time, one on the Advanced level and one on Proficiency level. Back in Sweden I started my second year of Upper Secondary in the Bilingual Social Science Programme at Ekeby school in Uppsala. I graduated in June 1998 and after spending the summer with my English family in France (in their summer home) I was offered to work as an English teacher for 9 to 12 year olds in Tierp. So, that is what I have been doing up to now. After all this practising I consider myself a good speaker of English. When I first came to London I felt rather unsure and made mistakes due to pure nervousness although the family I stayed with praised my speaking from the beginning. You know how it works, after a while you forget all about trying to speak correctly and it comes naturally to you. Other people I met in London thought my accent sounded South African or sometimes Australian. When my year had passed I went on holiday to Chicago and everybody there found my accent truly British. I quite liked that actually. I have also done a lot of speaking English in my two last years of Upper Secondary School as about two thirds of our lectures were held in English and all literature were English too. I don't believe I have any problems expressing myself or getting understood in English. I have had great use of this now when I was teaching. The pupils truly appreciated me speaking in English to them at all times and it was very fun to see how they understood more and more week by week. When it comes to reading I here too have a great use of the years in the Bilingual Class. I am now used to all sorts of reading English. Skimming through an article for information, studying hard for an exam, reading a homework or just reading for pleasure. Nowadays I prefer to read fiction in English at all times. I find it more exciting and sometimes a bit challenging. Reading English out loud is another thing. When I feel confident I almost like to hear my own voice reading and I fall right back into my Queens English accent. But, at other times I find myself sounding like a complete fool and that makes me feel like I lost everything. Anyway, I love reading but probably need to be more confident in reading out loud. Actually I love listening to English too. Good English that is, and sort of on my vocabulary level. I have to admit it is not very amusing to listen to a conversation from which you can only distinguish much more than a few words, although this must be a very good way to learn new vocabulary. I usually don't have to much trouble understanding people in everyday speaking but when it comes to listening comprehension tests it is not so obvious any longer. I find attending lectures held in English instructive but sometimes hard. An important thing is that you mustn't allow yourself to get stuck on a word enjoy it. I have a great imagination and the words just come so easily to my head. Writing is something I possibly would like to work with in the future so I guess it would be worth putting some effort in getting better.
EE291	0	﻿ The dramatic change in the way kids dress During the last five years a dramatic change has taken place in the way kids dress. If you visit a class in the fourth grade you will see girls wearing tight stretch jeans, pink hot tops with texts like "I am a Barbie Girl", five inch platform shoes and don't be surprised if several of the kids, although just 10 year of age, wear make-up. The boys in the same class would most likely wear baggy pants, baggy shirts and baggy hats, all of some expensive brand. All of these clothes are very fashionable and cool according to the fashion designers, but at the same time they make it very much impossible for the kids to play. So the kids should hate these clothes like they hate everything else that prevents them from playing. But they don't. So what are the reasons behind this trend? Since parents have the ultimate responsibility for their children, they should be part of the answer we are looking for. Even if the parents aren't the driving force behind this trend, they must accept it, if not agree with it, in order for it to be a trend. They pay for the expensive clothes their children wear and by doing so they have given their consent. Can it be that parents like these clothes and want their kids to wear them? It may be so in a few cases, but most parents are not particularly interested in buying expensive clothes that are anything but durable and that prevent their children from playing. Consequently, it must be the kids that want these clothes. Why? In my own experience, kids hate everything that prevents them from playing and having fun for example bedtime, Sunday dinners and museum visits. So, who or what has so successfully persuaded these kids to wearing these extreme clothes? The first and maybe most obvious answer to that is advertising. There has been an enormous increase in advertising aimed at kids in the last five years. Much due to this the kids in the fourth grade are much more aware of fashion and what is cool than their parents. Traditionally kids have worn very proper clothes based on durability, but today they wear clothes that their parents wouldn't be caught dead in, all in accordance with the latest fashion. Advertising aimed at kids has become smarter, more extensive and more daring. But there is still something missing, because advertising can convey a positive image of these clothes to the kids, but it takes more to persuade them to wear clothes that prevent them from doing most things that kids usually love to do. You can advertise for cereals all you want to but if they don't taste good kids will not eat them anyway. There must be a reason why kids find these clothes attractive. This leads us to the main driving force behind this trend. Childhood is all about learning. The best way of learning is to imitate those who have, or rather those you think have, the knowledge and experience. You look for role models to imitate and learn from. If we look at who the role models are to today, and especially at how they dress, there is no doubt that this trend is all about imitating the people you admire. The girls want to look like celebrities like Brittney Spears or Jennifer Lopez and the boys like Eminem and the guys in The Offspring. The smaller kids who don't know much about these stars just want to look the older kids. Clothes play a very important role for the images these celebrities have. Accordingly, kids learn that you are what you wear. It goes to such lengths that the kids prefer have the right image to have fun. To sum up, this trend couldn't exist if parents didn't accept and allow it. They are how ever not one of the main driving forces behind the trend. Advertising aimed at kids has had an enormous upswing in the last five years and has definitely had a great influence on the consumption of fashion orientated clothes for kids. But the main reason behind this trend is that the kids want to look like their role models who wear very extreme clothes as a part of their image. As long as the kids have these role models and as long as their parents allow it, this trend will prevail and even grow.$$$﻿ WHY YOUNG GIRLS FEEL THEY HAVE TO BE PROVOCATIVE I have for a number of years noticed that young girls try to act older. They dress and act more sexually provocative than my friends and I did when we were their age, and that was not many years ago. These young girls use more make-up during an ordinary day than I use during a whole week. This is a trend that, in my oppinion, will not disappear but what could be the causes for it? Well, there are many possible reasons. One could be the force of group pressure. Friends and class-mates consider someone to be un-hip if that person does not follow the current fashion or trend. Group acceptance is very important to young girls. Nobody wants to be visibly different giving the others something to pick on. There are those who dares to be different, but then it is a 'good' or accepted kind of different, and there are usually more than one girl daring to differ from the main group. But the fact is that young girls do not come up with these fashion trends by themselves and most of them do not even buy their own clothes. So group pressure is most probably not the main reason. Young girls seldom have the money to buy their own clothes and therefore their parents and other relatives buy the clothes for them. This another reason that could be the casuse of this trend. Society at large accepts that these young girls dress the way they do. Firstly it is the parents that accept that their eleven-year-old wears make-up, mostly over-done mascara and eye-liner making the youg girls look like they have slept in it. But you cannot only blame the parents. Girls have been known to sneak out to put the make-up on on their way to school. Therefore some of the responsibility lies with the schools and the teachers. At least one school in Sweden has allready introduced a total ban of make-up on pupils before the age of thirteen. But many schools have not yet seen the attitude change in these young girls as a problem, they have accepted it. But you cannot blame them, Being constantly bomboarded with commesial pictures illustrating the way to look. Therefore niether parents nor the schools have created this trend and acceptance is a cause but it is also an effect of what I see as the main cause. As mentioned above young girls do not get fashion ideas right out of the blue. They are influenced by different media, such as magazines and television. The current trend in the fashion world is to use very young models. Some of the larger agenies have a number of models that have not yet entered their teens. A very good example of such a model is Milla Jovovich who was on the cover of VOUGE when she had just turned twelve. To use young people as the front figure is not only common in the fashion world but something that can also be found in the music business. It is not uncommon to find that the front figure in a band or group is or tries to look as young as possible. A good example of this in Sweden is A-Teens and in Germany Blomchen, who tries to look younger to appeal to their main audiences. In England the 'inn-thing' is to create stars out of kids around the age of ten to thirteen. All these famous people are presented to the children through magazines and television shows. These media are commercial and are trying to appeal to girls by showing them the lives of the rich and famous. They also try to show girls how to become more like their favorite. But this was largely the case when I was coming into my teens too, the difference being that now the clothes and other attributes are available. Almost any larger store-chain has the kind of clothes the stars wear and they are not at all expensive. So what really causes the young girls to wear provocative clothes and use an extensive amount of mak-up is the big money they reprenent to the market-operators. Young minds are easily convinced that a certain product is what they need on their way to become stars. Therefore a fashion is created and artists and/or models paid to show it in various media creating a demand for the items, that the parents will have to buy to satisfy their young girls. All springing from the illusion that the children can become somebody they are not by dressing and acting like them. This trend will not disappear. It springs from the root of many evils; Greed. As long as the big companies make a profit on the young girls they will not change their concept. Allthuogh some model agecies has dared stand up and say that they do not allow girls under the age of sixteen anymore. The trend/problem has to be acknowledged before anyone is likely to try and do something about it.
EE425	1	﻿ Television-to be or not be? What is there to say about television or rather what is there not to say? How could we benefit to the utmost possible extent from the phenomenon of television? Since it is all but impossible to escape television and anything connected to it, we must learn to adapt to it and use it according to our own wishes and needs. When we hear what other people think about television it is sometimes easier to structure our own thoughts and opinions about it and that is what I have tried to do and I hope it may bring some new aspects and angles to your very own idea of television. First of all I would like to stress the difficulty you find yourself in when having to decide whether television is a positive or negative phenomenon. Probably it is a little of both, because if that was not the case the discussion would probably have faded long ago after some authority or other had decided upon television's to be or not to be. Imagine television would be abolished this very day! The thought is rather awkward and seems very implausible. A television-free society must be like entering a bakery shop and only be offered a small piece of hard bread. Hard bread for all it's worth but a delicious cake once in a while could enlighten our day very much with very little effort. So may television. Of course, this "once in while" may easily turn into an abuse that would captivate us in front of the TV too much. Many people surely spend more than half of their time awake in front of their television set, which is hardly to recommend since watching TV naturally involves a very sedentary life with bad health and maybe overweight as an effect to it. It is also easy to be isolated from friends and social life if too much time is spent in front of the TV. Television also seems to have a tendency not to portray reality accurately. Documentaries and news are often modified, leaving out the unappealing parts. Thus, if television were the only source of information, it would be difficult to achieve an honest picture of the actual reality. Fortunately television has not yet the monopoly of conveying news, nor the monopoly of any other issue. At the time being it is up to each and one of us to choose how much and what we want to watch and depending on our own choices we may benefit from a television offering substantial and educational programs and shows. The positive aspect of television lies perhaps mainly in this possibility to choose. If we choose a program because it covers a topic we are specifically interested in it brings only good. There are also different kinds of courses; in language, IT, business and much else, which are also all part of a positive aspect of television. Education and other serious matters are of course very important but we should not overlook the fact that television is to a great extent an entertainment phenomenon and to many people that is television's only purpose, to entertain. Some people consider television as pure entertainment though it ought to be more serious and deal with questions concerning global and severe problems. Once again the diversity and possibility to choose may be stressed to show that there are entertaining and frankly pathetic programs broadcasted, whose appropriateness and existing might be questioned but again this is exactly why they do exist. After hours and hours of hard work and nothing but sad or terrible news we could use some sort of amusement that does not demand much more than our physical presence. What we actually choose to do does not really matter, so the television set might be an opportunity as good as any. If looking back at what has been said here it pretty much confirms the fact that the questions about television will remain unanswered. Probably there will never be any definite answers but we will always have a lot of ideas and opinions about this topic and I am positive this is only one of many, but still unique, opinion about television and its significance to society.$$$﻿ Let kids try the game before they have to spell it! For the past few decades the importance of good education has increased considerably and lead to decisions such as letting six-year-olds or younger attend school. The sooner they learn how to read and write the better!? That is most questionable, indicating the children's need to be children and not having to make faster progress or take greater responsibility than is actually necessary. Being a child of six years or less, much time is devoted to explore the closest surroundings and adapt to a suiting role in the family. It's hardly fair to put them in school, forcing them to sit still for long periods and obey their teachers, who are too few in numbers and thus not able to prevent or end the, more oftenly, noisy and unpleasant environment. To some children this can be very distracting and they get very worked up missing out on individual progress, as persons, as well as on apprehending what's taught in class. The actual knowledge achieved in class can also be discussed. Authorities want a complete curriculum with Swedish, Mathematics, Science, History and even English! Despite lack of literacy in Swedish they are meant to learn English. (Making sure they are familiar with the language, so a third language can be introduced as soon as possible.) This easily creates greater gaps between gifted and non-gifted children, which is already an extensive problem. For both groups the higher demands are often connected to more responsibility which at this age are simply too much to ask for. Self-criticism, low self-esteem, loss of faith and apathy towards education, are common effects on this, unfortunate aim for great progress. Thus, accounts must be taken for mental effects as well. So far it has all been focused on the educative aspects, but the children's ability to adapt socially, can by no means be left out. To start with, leaving the safety of the home can be very bewildering, as being away from the parents, who has been their only fixed point in life, so far. Put in school they're thrust into a miniature society with fix rules, expectations and set models. They are deprived their own chance to experience and explore this fascinating life itself. If they're given the possibility to spend more time at home with their parents, that would create a more harmonic and natural environment for all parts, the parents indulged in a well-needed brake from the hectic working life, as an example. A last aspect to this is the financial aspect, which is profitable as well, since expenses for education; teachers, materials, food, buses, will decrease and the individual family could profit from lower taxes, and possibly smaller amounts on fashionable clothes, contributions to school trips and other activities. This part might be contradicted by many, since a lot of people probably think there'll be a loss of income if the parents spend more time at home with their children, instead of working, but with active planning of ones' work that can be prevented. The opinion, of many opponents, that not attending to school and having too much freetime and lack of settled daily routine would invite them to adopt bad habits, can only be defended by the fact that the parents are present and regulate these factors. Knowing, most of us want the best for the children and their future it is quite clear that school attendance should not be commenced by the age of six or earlier. They would become more harmonic, distressed and happy if they could spend more time in their home environment together with neighbourhood friends and parents. Life is precious and should not be wasted or hasten through. Make it possible for kids to see what life is really all about, before it has passed them by.
EE424	0	﻿INTRODUCTION This essay is about my strengths and weaknesses in English. I haven't used my English for five years so feel a little bit rusty in every area, writing, speaking, listening and reading. There is one common theme in all of the paragraphs below, they will all going to mention my limited vocabulary, something I am working hard to improve. Another very clear problem is active use of the language. My passive skills are much better. Now let me introduce my English skills in the following paragraphs. LISTENING Listening is one of my strengths. That's mainly because one just can't 'avoid' English on television, it is part of everyday life. As long as the communication stays verbal I have absolutely no problems. I do have to admit that my limited vocabulary does cause some trouble every now and then, but only the words that are new to me, otherwise I generally understand what somebody is telling me. Although I don't have problems with listening, it's difficult to transfer the oral message into a written form. The problems caused by this problem will be demonstrated in the next chapter. WRITING Writing is one of the biggest problems that I have with English. My vocabulary isn't large enough. It's actually pretty embarrassing. That's why I use easy words. First of all I spell words terribly. I make very simple spelling mistakes. It's good that I have the word processor in my computer that picks out the worst mistakes, hopefully. Swedish disturbs even my written English. I can write really complicated sentences and then notice that there are words written in a Swedish way for example 'and' is written 'och'. Swedish grammar affects my word order, I am sure of that. I always want to put the verb in the second place in word order. It's kind of difficult to actually comment on word order at the moment because I've just started writing in English. I do forget write the subject or the verb of a sentence and I think that's because of my mother tongue Finnish or that I'm usually careless. The next paragraph will be dealing with a passive language skill and that is reading. READING Reading is one of my strengths. Although I have to skip over a lot of words, especially in academic books, I can quite easily follow the writer's ideas. I have to say that I don't normally have any troubles with reading probably because I've always been good at guessing the word because of the context. I've always read a lot of paperbacks in English, it's always a pleasure to relax with a good book. SPEAKING Speaking is one of my biggest problems. The problem is that I try to pronounce English with same rules that I use for Swedish. Because I've studied Swedish so much I know how important it is to have the right stress and rhythm when you're speaking. That's something I have to learn. I also have to learn the right quality of the vowels and consonants. Vowels cause me some trouble, especially if the word is long, I've problems finding the rhythm. One of my absolutely strongest sides is the courage to use the language even though it's not perfect. The only way to improve it is to use it. I haven't had so many possibilities to speak English in the past. I need to learn more words that I can actively use. The fact that my Swedish is so much stronger than my English leads to the fact that I can begin a sentence in English only to find that somewhere along the way I've changed to Swedish without noticing it. I hate it. They have so much in common, their vocabularies are so like and certain words are even pronounced in the same way. That distracts for me. It takes too long time for me to find the right word, and my speaking is not as fluent as it could be, mainly because of my limited vocabulary and partly because I haven't had the opportunity to use English as much as I would have liked.$$$﻿The ability to listen is probably one of my strengths in English and I think my listening skills are quite good. I don't feel there is any problem to follow the teachers thoughts in lectures and seminars. I haven't spent any longer time in England but there is a constant flow of English language on television here in Sweden and I think that is one of the reasons why I'm so used to hear English. Another reason can be that my parents are from Finland and when I was a child they spoke Finnish when they were talking privately to each other and didn't want me to understand. Quite soon I learned to understand what they were talking about and after finding that out my parents began to talk Swedish to each other instead. Maybe this experience taught me to learn by listening or at least made my more open to foreign languages. The next big part of the English language is reading, and I knew there were going to be a lot of reading the coming term so I thought that it would be a good idea to begin a little bit earlier with the recommended books. When I first started do read, I were convinced that I'll never make it through this course. It took me an enormous amount of time to get through just a few pages and I felt that I missed a lot in the text. After a while I noticed that it was getting a little bit easier and that it's the first pages that are the worst ones. After a while you get familiar with the vocabulary and the authors' way of writing. It still takes a lot of time for me to get through a text but I hope eventually that it will go faster and that I will feel more confindete in myself. One thing I have noticed is that things like irony and humour is very hard to detect. In an informative text it's just to read and understand the words but in a literary text I feel that I often miss the underlying motive. I understand the sentences and the words but I can't "see and feel" the text like I do when I read a Swedish book. I hope this is something that will occur to me in time. The part that is called speaking is a very important part in the teachers program and I'm well aware of the fact that this is one of the things that I find very hard. The words just don't pop up naturally and I find myself looking for the word I want to express but often it's just not there. I am also well aware of the fact that this is because of a lack in my vocabulary and the best way to help myself is to read a lot. My pronunciation is sometimes good and sometimes bad. Most words I know how to pronounce but when I'm speaking it's hard to keep the tongue right in my mouth. When I speak really slowly the problem does not occur but when I have to speed up for example in a discussion it's harder. I'm convinced that also this problem is a matter of training. Spelling, pronouncing, and grammar goes together hand in hand. I know that many of my spelling faults depend on the fact that I don't give it enough time when I'm writing something and also the fact that I haven't been using my English for years. I think I often write in a kind of "swenglish". Like I said before I'm sure this will change when I get more practice. The first weeks or maybe mount will be hard work and making a lot of faults but in time it will get easier.
EE426	1	﻿ DUTY-FREE IS VITAL FOR THE BALTIC SEA I do not regret that I voted for EU and not against it but having said that there are many regulations that EU has conceived that I just cannot understand. For instance European Union has decided to cease the duty-free sale in the Baltic Sea. As far as I am concerned there are not any particular reasons for putting down the most important industry in the Baltic Sea except that this sort of opportunity is said to be unfair for the other EU-countries. Although mentioned above some drawbacks of EU, I would not have any hesitation to vote for it again but this argumentation is not about EU but the sea trade between Finland and Sweden. I have doubts that they have not considered the consequences throughout in Brussels. If the duty-free sale finish in 1999 like it has been planned it will be a catastrophe. To whom, might one ask, and the answer is to everyone, that is, Swedes and the Finns. First of all there has been a lot of emigration from Finland to Sweden and vice versa. So for us who has to travel back and forth, these ferries offer us a great possibility to visit our families and friends with a reasonable price. There are of course aeroplanes but the difference between the prices is enormous and for example for me flying is absolutely impossible despite the student loan. One can ask what has the duty-free sale got anything to do with travelling across the sea. Well, there is a logical explanation which is that the shipping companies make the profit by selling lots of duty-free products. Ferries survive because of the duty-free sale opportunity and not because of the ticket sale, tickets cost basically nothing. So, what will happen if people will not travel by ferries when losing the possibility to buy cheap items? Unemployment will increase. Employees lose their jobs, which would be a disaster for approximately 5000 workers. Shipping companies cannot afford to keep all of their workers if there are no passengers. The Baltic sea ferries are popular among the emigrants and immigrants but also among people who just want to relax for few days and cannot afford to travel all the way to Spain. Taking a cruise is a cheap way to get rid of the normal routine. Ferries offer lots of entertainment for all age-groups. There are for example restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Passengers can do some shopping, eat well and dance until four in the morning with help of cheap pints and fancy cocktails. Bearing in mind the employment situation, ferries also offer different sorts of jobs for the musicians and magicians, in one word entertainers. The alcohol consuming is quite high in Scandinavia. Finland and Sweden have their alcohol monopolies and prices are high. If EU refuse individual's privilege to buy duty-free alcohol it will lead to a situation that a home distilling will increase worringly. Also smuggling will grow which will develope certain problems. People will commit crimes first of all by smuggling alcohol and secondly by selling it forward. There are not any ways to close down the Baltic Sea trade. There are different solutions to keep this duty-free possibility by changing the routes. This means that if there is a route from Stockholm to Helsinki, which takes about twelve hours, they will change it in a way that the ferry goes to Tallin first and then to Helsinki. In that way people can buy duty-free products because Estonia is not a part of European Union. This voyage would take two or three hours extra but it would be worth it. Also Iland has a special situation being an autonomous island which helps ferries to retain the duty-free sale if pulling up to the harbour. Duty-free sale in the Baltic Sea gives a condition of ferries' excistence. It would be a disaster for everyone if a duty-free sale did not exist. It would be a catastrophe for me to lose this chance to travel in low-cost back to Finland. I do not have anything against aeroplanes but the fact is that living abroad for a year means that my luggage weight so many kilograms that I am not even allowed to enter the plane with all my stuff. Ferries also offer a great opportunity for the Finns to travel easily to Europe. I do not certainly want to lose ferries and the duty-free sale and believe me I am not the only one.$$$﻿According to the number of years that I have studied English, one could assume that I would be able to read, speak, write and communicate with other people without having any massive difficulties. I really do wish that it would be that simple. In a way it is true that my English is in a stable state where I am confident to use it in every day basis and also to be able to study dissimilar subjects in English. Regarding to the fact that I come from Finland and my mother tongue is so unlike comparing to the other languages explains somehow my incomplete knowledge from foreign languages. In my native language, Finnish that is, we do not have for instance any prepositions or articles. These grammar dissimilarities creates insuperable barriers for me that has perhaps something to do with my laziness and a lack of concentration. I presume that I have not even learned the basic things throughout even though language teaching is highly appreciated in Finland. I guess that learning a new language properly from the beginning, in this content English, would have helped me to achieve a firm and a strong standard that I would be able to use English in sort of a native way. If I start with listening I am happy to inform that this particular skill is presumably my strongest. During the few years I have had a chance to be in a sort of environment that people have used different accents and dialects that I have become accustomed to listen. Certainly I have to admit that even still today I have to apologize occasionally when I am not able to comprehend despite my background abroad. But then again it is quite logical that I have to ask people to repeat themselves because I am a foreign and I will never become a fully bilingual person. Besides one has to be really careful when listening for example to a strong Scottish accent or if having a conversation with a real Paddy. Separations between different accents are enormous. Apparently my reading comprehension is rather good as well. When reading a newspaper, a magazine or a book I do not need to reach out my dictionary although there are words which meanings I do not have a slightest clue. But that does not matter because one is able to guess their meaning of the context. Reading in English would be quite simple if having a vast vocabulary because the alphabets are normal if making a comparison to our Scandinavian alphabets. Usually what happens during the language learning progress is that it is much easier to imbibe passively everything new than produce the new language actively by yourself. Generally people might be afraid of using the new language or feel embarrassment if making mistakes. That does not happen to me because I seriously do think that as long as I am able to socialize with people with my incomplete English is all that matters to me. I do not bother when I realise that I have made some easy mistakes or my pronunciation has not been perfect. y writing skills are rather insufficient which really annoys me because when ever I do write essays or even just letters to my mates abroad I feel myself disabled. My capacity is not adequate and I do not have any talent for writing and believe me this negativity has nothing to do with my low self-confidence. The weakest point in my English is the academic writing. I do not know how to use long and sophisticated words which would link a subordinate clause and a main clause easily together. The structure in my written English is poor which is sad to admit but that is the truth. After all these years of studying English and using it in practice and yet not having more fluency with it, leaves me disappointed with a great frustration. The fact is that English is a quite complicated language but still I should have learned it better. Unfortunately I have come to a conclusion that my knowledge of English will not come to improve. I have not given up yet and I refuse to do so in the future but I am sure that this enormous frustration will continue no matter what.
EE154	0	﻿When I was eleven years old I started to study English at school. I didn't get a really good start because I didn't understand why I had to learn English and therefore I wasn't very eager to learn. The most important thing why I never was a good student in English, I think, was that I found it very boring. I couldn't understand what others found so fascinating about knowing a foreign language. Because of all these reasons, I was always behind in my English studies and when I graduated from senior high school my English marks were low. I realized that I had to do something about it to be admitted to the University so I went to Boston, MA to work as a nanny for a year. In the beginning of my year in the USA it was hard to be around people who only spoke English, but after a few weeks I could understand almost everything the family was talking about. The family I lived with was big, five children and their parents, so I always had someone to talk to or listen to. It was very good practice. Now I had a reason to learn how to understand English. The children I took care of told me things that had happened at school, etc. and I really wanted to understand every word they were telling me. Now I can feel comfortable when people are talking to me in English. What I still find pretty hard is to understand some English spoken by people from Great Britain because I'm so used to American English. What I found most difficult during my stay in the USA was to talk without sounding like a five-year old. During the first months my speaking really improved but after a while I found myself standing on the same spot, not improving at all. I wanted to be able to speak about serious things but couldn't find the words that said what I wanted to. I still feel that I can improve my English speaking a lot, but on the other hand I feel I can have an everyday conversation with English speaking people. Before I went to Boston I hadn't read one whole book in English. I didn't read very much when I was there either except for the books I read to the children, which actually was a lot. I think the reason why I didn't read so much when I was abroad was that I was so tired of English in the evenings and weekends. In my spare time I'd rather write letters in Swedish to my friends and family at home. When I returned to Sweden after a year in Boston it was nice to speak Swedish again but after a while I started to miss the English language. It was a very strange feeling because I never thought that could happen to me. I started to read some books in English and really enjoyed it. I'm still reading a lot more books in Swedish than in English but it's nice to know that it's not that hard to read in English. I also think reading is a simple but efficient way to learn the language better. I don't know if reading English will make me a better writer but I sure hope so. I would never advise anyone to work as an au-pair if their only goal was just to improve their writing skills because you don't have to write a single word in English, I didn't anyway. I feel like my writing is as bad as it was before I went abroad. I have always enjoyed writing in Swedish so I hope, with some help and a lot of hard work, I will improve my writing skills a lot. I think that the best way to learn a language is to stay in a country with native speakers for a year or so. It worked for me anyway, but I think I had improved even more if I went there to study. Than I would have been forced to write and read. A year abroad made me understand the reason why I have to learn English and, even more important, now I can find it enjoyable to learn a second language.$$$﻿ Evaluation English, my English! So now I'm supposed to wright about my skills in English. One thing I can say is that I wish I was better. It's not that I'm terrible at it, but sometimes I just can't find the right words. I want to be able to use English just as easy as I use Swedish. I guess it depends on how much I use it, how much practice I get. When I was 17, I went to Hastings in England for four weeks of English studies, and my English has never been better than when I came home to Sweden again. Me and a friend stayed with mr and mrs Lewis and their baby Sarah, and mrs Lewis talked uninterruptedly from the moment we arrived. She asked all sorts of questions about everything, but I guess that was a good thing, because otherwise I might have been too afraid to speek at all. After a week I wasn't afraid to speak at all and when it was time to go home, it felt like I was born English. Anyway, that was a long time ago and I haven't been speaking much English since then. This means that I must have it all somewhere in my head. It's just that I don't know where. Hopefully I will find at least some of it during this semester. Listening This is something I find quite easy. English isn't at all hard to understand, unless the one who's speaking is from Scotland or something. It doesn't matter if there's one or two words I don't understant, because I usually understand the rest of it. I hear English everywhere around me. I hear it in music, on the television and when I go to the movies. I also like listening to recorded books and the ones in Swedish are really boring, so I go for the English ones. I guess that is good practice. It's nice to have lectures in English and find that I actually understand everything the teacher is saying. Reading y skills in reading are probably the same as in listening. In short I can say that I understand most of what i read. I really like books and if they are written by an English or an American author, I prefer to read them in the original language. Once in a while a word that I don't recognice pops up, and sometimes I look it up. But if I understand the context, than I almost always understand the word without having to look it up. I find reading and listening easyer than speaking and writing, and I guess that's because I can take my time and think, and I don't have to be afraid to do something wrong. Nobody will care if there's a word or two that I don't understand in a text or during a lecture, but if I say or wright something incorrect, everybody will notice it. Speaking The reason I find it difficult to speak English, especially if the one I'm speaking to is from an English speaking country, is that I'm afraid to say something wrong that will make me look stupid. I have a cousin in Ireland and he told me once that he had almost no English at all in school, and that my English probably was better than his so I guess I don't have that much to worry about, but sometimes it's so hard to find the right words. If I talk som someone out in a pub or in one of the nations, and if I've had a beer or two, than my English is great, but in the classroom, I just sound stupid. That's something I don't like at all, and I hope all the speaking in school will help me with this. Writing Now this is the tricky part. I can't remember half of what I learned about Swedish grammar, so how am I supposed to know about transitive verbs, complements and subordinate clauses? It's so easy to wright in Swedish, but when I do it in English I have to think about everything. I can think of something I really want to wright, and then i have to wright it in some other way because I don't know how to formulate it. This is really very frustrating. I guess practice is the medicine for this too. Finally I really like English and want to learn how to use it, without having to think and worry about everything I say. I guess it would be an exaggeration to say that my English is bad, but it could be a lot better, and I hope this semester of English studies will help me on the way.
EE474	0	﻿ Give the elderly a decent treatment The whole idea of having the elderly at their respective families instead of having them at a home for the aged is absurd. Although if the two alternatives may give an equal amount of arguments I can't see why there can be any doubt of which side to take in comparison of the two options. To begin with, who in each family should be responsible of taking care of that the elder will be getting the right medicine at the right moment. On the other hand, you can always educate people in general medicine. But, you will never reach the same trust like you do if a real nurse is taking care of it. Moreover, accidents come whether you want them or not. And in situations of that kind you can count on a proper behaviour when it comes to solving it, if your elder is surrounded by professionals instead of amateurs. Secondly, how can a family have a twenty-four hours control as you have in state care. Of course, it is just to split the hours between the familymembers and go on with this schedule every week. As a result of this solution comes the inevitable question of how much each familymember are willing to sacrifice to secure this twenty-four hours control. You can't guarantee that everyone always will be able, or want to follow a schedule like that. In contrast, if you just use persons who are educated and trained for a specific task, they will do all that is required from them. Because why would they otherwise choose it as their profession. Therefore it would be wrong to even think that a family can be as reliable as a home for the aged. Relationship is indeed something valuable, but it is simply not just enough in this issue. In addition to how it will be for the familymembers to give up a certain bit of their spare-time to manage to solve it, you must look on the other side of the coin. No one can possibly come and say that any elder, who has been brought up to get things done, would like an situation where he or she would be a burden instead of an asset for the family. The elderly will with no doubt feel that they are limiting the other familymembers wills to do stuff which they get more satisfaction from, when they have to be stuck at home watching them instead. These two statements may assume to that any kind if sickness has to be involved to create this understanding. But, in fact that is not necessary at all. Just the thing that the elderly can't be home alone even though that they are in great condition is enough to describe why it is like that. For who can you blame if something happens to your old relative when you or someone else not are present. This fact is just another thing you can avoid if you leave it to the professionals. Next problem which will appear if we let the elderly become a family matter is unemployment. Homes for the aged is one of the largest working places in our current society. Because if the families should look after the elderly they can't hire anyone else to do it for them. And then there won't be any similar place to go to for all the people who are working at any home for the aged at the moment. For this reason they won't be out of options but it is not easy to find something else to do just like that. Everyone will not have the will or the potential, which is demand if they want to avoid unemployment. Thus, the elderly deserves to feel that they can contribute with something and that they fill a function without interfering some other person. The elderly must get good treatment at any time and they should feel confident that they are in safe hands if something happens to them. This is not an illusion, it is how the reality should look like when everyone reaches an higher age. But it will just be an illusion if the elderly becomes a family matter.$$$﻿ A world without television Could you manage without your TV? Would your life be over if you had to get rid of it? You may feel that way, but, as I see it, it is not so. I want to, through my arguments and through this essay, show you that it is possible and even good to live without a TV. However, nowadays it is hard to find a home without a TV and it seems to be one important part of a good standard of living. For many people, watching TV is a natural daily thing as well as working, going to school, spending time with family and friends. Being aware of all this, I still maintain that it is possible to live your life without a TV, I do nowadays. I think it is even good for you and you will benefit from it. Let me tell you why through my three arguments and my conclusion. My first argument is about economy. The possession of a TV will increase your costs. First of all you need to have a television set. A new one costs several thousand Swedish crowns. Furthermore you have to pay about 400 Swedish Crowns each quarter of a year, just for the possession of it. Other expenses that might occur are for example: if the TV gets out of order it needs to be repaired. If you then do not have a warrant, the repair will probably cost you a lot of money. A TV costs you money, but that is not all. My second argument is that I think it can take more things away from you, like your imagination and your creativity. Let me explain this further. When you watch TV you are stuffed with a large number of images, fast clips and a lot of information, not always good information. It is like you do not have to think of your own. Everything is given to you. I think this is bad, especially for young children that watch TV too much. As a consequence of this, it is not strange that they might find school and reading boring because life outside the TV-screen can not be as intensive as the fast clips on MTV or on another channel. Moreover, by the fact that TV does not trigger their imagination or encourage them to think for themselves, I feel that they are not given the possibility to fully develop their own thinking in order to become strong individuals. As I just explained, I am of the opinion that TV can kill your imagination, in addition, watching TV can also be a time-killing occupation, which leads to my next argument. My third and final argument is that the TV does take valuable time away from you, that you instead could spend on something else or with someone else. In today's society, we all complain about that there is never enough time. We rush to work and to school, we rush home, we have to cook, clean, wash, do this and that. Still we can spend hours in front of the TV. Maybe some of you may say that it is a way to relax, to forget all the 'musts' of our lives. I understand that, but I think that there are other ways of relaxing, like for example taking a walk, alone or with someone, reading a book or just spending time with the ones you love. Look at Sweden today, so many relationships do not last because we do not take the time to cherish them. I do not say TV is all to blame for this, but I do say that the time we spend on watching TV we could spend as quality time with our family or with our friends. It is a good start for making the world a better place. Now you have read my three arguments concerning life with or without a TV. I have claimed that the TV does take money, imagination and time away from us. If you turn this around: a life without a TV, compared to other people, will give you money to spend on something else, hopefully restore your imagination and creativity to make life more fun and last, but not least, it will give you time that you can give yourself and other people.
EE319	0	﻿ There are those who maintain that the family, not the state, should look after the elderly. I think that this is a socio-political and ethical topic that concerns us all. I believe that everybody should have the right to be taken care of no matter if we are rich or poor and neither should the colour of our skin and political ideas influence. Moreover, today's society doesn't really allow us to look after our elderly relatives, as we have to make ourselves a career, work full-time, bring up a family, spend quality time with friends, etc. The geriatric care can best see to that they are given the best help possible, not the family. Here below I will account for the three main arguments against the privat care of the elderly. First of all I would like to claim that this is our right as taxpayers and we have the right to make use of what we have built up. Growing old is part of most lives, and to be taken care of is not only a social right that we have, it is also a service that we have the right to buy since this service has been established owing to our taxes (the elderly do pay for the help they are given). Secondly we have the juridical aspects of it. Who is to be hold responsable if anything should happen? Could I be responsable for my mother's medical care not being a doctor? Do I have the responsability to give my grandmother the intellectual stimulation that her age requires, not being a therapist of any kind? I don't think so, just as I can't hold a doctor responsable for the horrible buildings of the seventies. Since the geriatric care is a service that the elderly have to pay for, I believe that they have the right to get qualified help from people that have the appropriate education and know how to accomodate the service to the need of the elderly. The final and third argument considers the quality of their lives. There are those who think that we need to spend more time with our relatives, so why not spend time with them and take care of them at the same time. It is true that we have lost that nearness or connection within the families that was so common some 30-40 years ago, but to give them a bath or to help them whith their activity of daily living is not the same as spending quality time with them. With quality time I refer to the social and cultural interchange and profit of people sharing time together. Anybody could help the elderly to prepair their breakfast or to do their cleaning, but only the relatives are close enough to know what they appreciate to do, what they like to read, to see, etc. We, the family, should spend more time with them to show them that we care and leave the nursing to the qualified medical service. Before I sum up this essay, I would like to stress the old generation's work and it should not be taken for granted. They were the ones to develop the Swedish welfare state and yesterday 's values, for instance, today both men and women can think about their careers at first hand, their lives will not come to an end just because they don't have children or a family. There are many elderly without relatives today and I think that there will be many more when our generation gets there, but we should still have the right to know that we are going to be taken care of even if we don't have relatives or someone to plead our cause. I believe that it's not the same to care for the elderly and to take care of them. We do care for our grandmothers and we do take care of them if we let the state look after them, after all, they do deserve the best help there is to get as they have already paid for it.$$$﻿I am going to assess my strengths and weaknesses of listening, reading, speaking and writing the English language. These four skills go from easy to difficult for me and probably for most people trying to use a foreign language. If that is the general idea there are still areas within each and one of these skills that are easy or hard, that is my skills would be more or less good, and I shall try to explain why. My strengths in listening to English are, according to me, not only the ability to understand normal conversation, but also to recognise various accents or the ways that people with different backgrounds speak in England. I have by living in England begun to appreciate these variations and it has actually helped my understanding of the culture and society. I feel quite happy about my level of understanding spoken English, but there are of course areas that are more difficult - like some British satire on television for example. Sometimes I realise that I haven't understood a word, obviously because of the context and the amount of rhyming slang spoken. I would say reading a political article in the newspaper is often easier than understanding some English humour! Sometimes my listening skills aren't at all as good as I think. I remember working as an office temp getting a task of writing down names and addresses from an answer machine. I found it extremely difficult to identify the names not to mention the addresses. I hardly got anything right. When it comes to reading and my strengths and weaknesses there, I feel that I know enough words to understand most things that I read, but at the same time there are plenty of words that I don't recognise. This isn't so bad that I would call it a weakness but not knowing the word in front of me certainly isn't a strength either. I also find that no text is free of these words that go from vague recognition to total unfamiliarity. The context of certain written works make them harder to comprehend, but reading Peter Rabbit to my fiancés four year old niece can also prove to be a hard task with the strangest words appearing in the text. y speaking skills are generally good but they vary with the company. Sometimes I feel fluent, sometimes I go more or less mute - it depends on the situation. What are my strengths in speaking? This is much more complicated to assess than the other skills depending on what one really expects from oneself. Is it a strength that I speak English more or less every day with Jason at home? Day to day conversation is quite limited and really doesn't expand my speaking skills at all. Furthermore, it is so easy to slip in a Swedish word instead of the English one I didn't know. On the other hand I must not pretend I haven't got any strengths out of living in England for three years and having been in close contact with the country for seven years. (Time flies!) I speak English without a strong Swedish accent. That is a strength but only if it is coupled with the right words or expressions. Someone once said to me "If you say something wrong people still won't know you're foreign, they'll just think you're stupid!" This was supposed to be a joke, but it is a weakness of mine to take this seriously. A weakness of a more grammatical kind, is that which I touched upon earlier, a limitation of words and expressions to use. I, for example, am in desperate need of more adjectives for I am fed up with using "nice" all the time. Everything I like is "nice" but it is such a limited way of describing things. Another one is "thing". A hilarious example is when I worked myself into a state trying to explain to my boyfriend that I wanted my "necessér" brought to me. But what on earth is it called? Necessary...no... necessity...nec... BRING THAT THING! -What! THE THING!! -What!! THE BLUE!!! (It was blue as a matter of fact, but I would have saved myself from getting upset had I then known what its English name was). This isn't at all a unique example of my lack of nouns by the way. Writing is not as frustrating as speaking but can still be the most difficult to master. I say that because a writing person must be self-sufficient enough to handle the language on their own. Having said that, writing can sometimes be easier than speaking since the writer doesn't have an immediate audience. It doesn't require the same quick thinking. The difficulties of writing depend upon the subject and who is going to read it in the end. I feel fairly confident that my grammar and spelling is all right but I don't feel totally sure that the language I use doesn't sound Swedish by the structure or wrong in another sense. What I assessed as my weaknesses in speaking, that is a lack of words to describe things, applies here as well of course, only that I don't feel the same panic about it when I write. I have tried to assess strengths and weaknesses the way I see them. I know it is possible that I might find more weak points as I go along, ones I have been too ignoran
EE152	1	﻿ HOW TO BE A GOOD LITTLE WOMAN In the novel Little Women by Louisa May Alcott we readers get to peek into the March family's household and follow the lives of its members for one year. It is a year of hardship but also a year of joy and wholesome experiences. What is so particular about this household during the year in question is that it exclusively consists of women as the father is away fighting in the war. Certainly, the absent father as well as other male characters in the novel are significant and present in their lives, but the focus of the novel is on the women, especially on the little women, of the March family, their individual roles in the family, their lives, their hopes and burdens, influences and values. The four daughters in the family, the little women, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, are very different from each other, each with her own hopes and ambitions. Meg, the oldest, is very much influenced by romantic novels and the lifestyle of the upper-class. She wants to be rich and pretty, marry a handsome man and live a life in luxury. Jo is a hot-tempered tomboy who would much rather be a boy than a girl since girls have to be calm and well-behaved with their hair turned up. Jo, who also is the family's amateur playwright and story writer, has dreams of becoming an author. Beth is the most timid of the sisters, she loves helping others and wants nothing for herself but a piano since she lives for music. Amy is the youngest of the sisters but though she is only twelve years old she is very strong-willed and hates it when her older sisters tell her what to do. Her dream is to become an artist as drawing is one of her passions.(p. 3-12, 69-70, 133) The four sisters are in other words regular teenage girls, fighting regular teenage problems and trying to find themselves as they are on the verge of bordering adulthood. In my opinion they are "the perfect daughters" personified as they are very well-behaved and hardworking girls, docile and obedient to their mother, loving and caring towards each other. Not to mention their many talents, their general knowledge and creativity. Yet, in the novel both they and their mother feel that they must put their "selfishness and reckless whims" behind them.(p. 10-11) The governing idea of the book, namely "how to be a good little woman" is introduced in the very first chapter, and then all through the novel we get to follow the four daughters' journey towards obtaining that goal. Though it is a letter from their father which awakens them to self-examination and initiates this journey, it is the mother who holds the key position as the little women's unquestionable leader and mentor, confessor and soother. The mother's own emotional life we do not get to know as intimately as her daughters', but we get to know her and her values and influences through her guiding of the daughters. Mrs March is neither strict nor punishing, but she is certainly ruled by strong convictions. Although there is a religious undertone in the novel it seems to be more a general belief in goodness, hard work and patience that rules her. The girls, ranging in age from twelve to seventeen, all have daily duties around the house. They help with the sewing, doing the dishes, the dusting and the like. The two older girls, Meg and Jo, also work during the daytime to help support the family's failing economy. Additionally Mrs March engages them all into helping a family poorer than themselves, trying to teach them the joy of giving. (p. 15-16, 35-41) Seemingly, the mother does not just want them to work hard but she wants them to learn how to enjoy it too. She gives each of the daughters a copy of The Pilgrim's Progress, a Christian allegory, to be used as a guidebook to overcome their faults and be good little women so that they can reach their own Celestial City. It might sound rigid and extremely religious but Mrs March is neither, she is actually a very loving, understanding and patient mother who never scolds or punishes her daughters, but only wants them to be good so that they can be truly happy. However, given the fact that the daughters' "bundles" consist of them being regular teenagers, i.e. sometimes behaving irrationally and wanting to have some fun, one feels that Mrs March sometimes rather expects too much of them.(p. 11, 90-91, 75-77) Nevertheless, Mrs March's method of teaching her girls about life is very effective. Instead of telling them what to do or what not to do she lets them experience things for themselves, make their own mistakes and come to their own conclusions. At the end of almost every chapter there is a lesson to be learnt and Mrs March rounds it up by listening to their confessions and giving her approval of their increasing insight. (p. 110-111) There is a lot of love in the March household, love between the mother and the daughters, love for the absent father, love for their friends and neighbours, the Laurences. It is often mentioned that love and companionship are far more important than money, that motto can be said to be another of the themes of the novel as many of the lessons learned by the little women constitutes of them realising how contented they really are just having each other. (p. 3, 78) When Meg suddenly gives some of her love to Mr Brooke, Mrs March again speaks of her belief that money is not as important as true love and a happy home as she tries to comfort Jo. Jo, however, is not concerned with Mr Brooke's economy but horrified at the thought of the family being disrupted. As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, it is in many ways a year of hardship for the Marches that is portrayed in the novel, and it is this strong connection between the March women that helps them pull through, so one can certainly understand Jo's feeling of insecurity and fear. (p. 188-189) However, despite the fact that the novel almost entirely features these strong and independent women struggling together, the mother being the little women's guide, it is yet somehow the man of the house, the absent father, who is the ultimate ruler of the family. It is the father who initiates the daughters' journey towards earning the name little women, and it is the father who finalises the journey by confirming that they have reached their destination and gives his approval. The mother has certainly praised and encouraged them, but the circle is not closed until the father returns and confirms the change. Even Mrs March tells that she learnt her gentle ways from her husband and that he made her into the woman she wants her daughters to copy. In other words he taught her what to teach them.(p.10, 76, 204-206) The constant eulogies to the noble Mr March feel a bit exaggerated and although he is put on a very high pedestal by his wife and daughters I think it is evident that that is much due to the mighty patriarchate of those times. The man was the head of the house. The fact that he fought in the war is also considered very honourable by his family, but I feel that the women of this household had their own war to fight, a war against poverty and against everyday problems. Growing up and helping your children to grow up are tasks as hard and as honourable as fighting a war for your country, that is plain to see for the readers of this novel. That is why it is so unfortunate that Mrs March and her daughters do not seem to realise this about themselves, they just see it as their duty as good little women. What is even more unfortunate is that still in today's reality many women do not get the credit they deserve for their hard work raising children and running a household at the same time. They are the ones who deserve medals for valour. As Louisa May Alcott herself once said: "Housework ain't no joke" (xroads.virginia.edu).$$$﻿ LANGUAGE VARIETIES A study of vocabulary differences between British and American English 1. Introduction The English language is spoken all over the world, it is the mother tongue of about 400 million people and about as many speak it as a second language. All speakers of English do not use the language in a uniform way though, there are many varieties of English. Of course there are more similarities than differences between the various varieties of English but the differences that do exist are still distinct enough to separate one variety from another. British English and American English are the two main standard varieties of English and differences between these two main varieties can be found within all areas of language use; in grammar, spelling, pronunciation, punctuation, vocabulary and style (Ilson 1985: 7). The vocabulary differences are among the most numerous and they also seem to cause the most confusion. The purpose of this essay is to disperse some of that confusion and instead, hopefully, shed some light on vocabulary differences between British English and American English. I have chosen to limit the investigation to the culinary area, i.e. words related to beverages, food and foodpreparing. What I intend to find out is; how common the differences are, what types of differences there are and if one type is more frequent than the others. My primary material consists solely of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, from which I collected the first 200 words I found that are related to food. I chose to collect words beginning with the letters c and s because those two letters are given the most space in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. I collected 100 words from each letter and singled out those which showed a difference between British English and American English. Then I categorised them according to the classification used by Trudgill and Hannah (1985), which consists of four major categories: 1. Different word for the same concept or item, 2. Same word-different meaning, 3. Same word-additional meaning in one variety, 4. Word less frequent but understood in the other variety. As I had expected the categorisation involved a few problems. Firstly, some of the words seemed to belong to more than one category. Secondly, since I am a non-native speaker of English and the relationship between British English and American English is quite complex it was very difficult to know which words to put where regarding the sub-types of the 1st category, and which words to put in category 4. To help solve the problems I used two British-American dictionaries; Britspeak and Richard Smith's Compendium of Britishisms. After having done the classification I analysed the results and tried to put together a clear and easy to understand presentation which will follow in the next chapter. All definitions of the words are according to the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. Abbreviations that will be used in the presentation of the results are; BrE for British English, AmE for American English. 2 Results Out of 200 words related to food 62 words, (33 beginning with c and 29 beginning with s), showed a difference between BrE and AmE. The table below shows the distribution of the words into the different categories, 8 words appear in more than one category: Total number of words 62 Different word for the same item 44 Same word different meaning 10 Same word additional meaning in one variety 13 Word less frequent in one variety 7 2.1 Different word for the same concept or item According to Trudgill and Hannah (1985) the majority of lexical differences between BrE and AmE are of this type. That turned out to be the case also in my investigation, 44 out of 62 words belong to this category, though the 7 words marked with * appear in more than one category. The words in this category can be divided into two sub-types; one where the word is not widely known in the other variety, and another where the word is known. In the list below the words in bold type are words that are widely known in the other variety: <table removed> 2.2 Same word - different meaning The words in this category are without a doubt the most confusing ones for speakers of BrE and AmE. Luckily these kinds of words are quite few in number as opposed to the previous category (Trudgill and Hannah 1985: 77). In my investigation 10 words out of 62 belong to this category: <table removed> 2.3 Same word - additional meaning in one variety The words belonging to this category are words that are frequently used in both BrE and AmE, but in one variety they have an additional meaning not known in the other. Possibly these words are as confusing as the words in the category above, these types of words are quite common though (Trudgill and Hannah 1985:77). In this investigation 13 words out of 62 fit the description of this category: <table removed> 2.4 Word less frequent but understood in the other variety This category of words is the least confusing for Brits and Americans, it is also the category containing the least number of words in this investigation, only 7 words out of 62: <table removed> 3 Summary According to Ilson (1985) it is very common that figures concerning this type of investigation are misleading, even in greater investigations. The reason for that is the movement between, and the mix of the two varieties that many speakers of both varieties experience. Not to mention the numerous regional varieties within the standard varieties, that sometimes can be closer to another standard variety than its own. How you speak, which words you use and how much you understand of another variety is very individual. Probably what would give more insight into the matter is to investigate why there are differences. We know that there are differences, that can easily be proven, but what do the differences consist of? Unfortunately, due to its restriction this essay will not be able to provide the answers to that question, but it would certainly be an interesting area to investigate. To sum up the result of this mini-investigation I think it is safe to say that it confirmed that vocabulary differences between British and American English are very common. Out of the 200 words that I collected 62 words showed a difference between the two varieties, that is 31% or almost 1/3 of the words. Even though this investigation was limited to the culinary area and only consisted of 200 words I still think that one could assume that it reflects the vocabulary in general. The majority of the differences belong to the 1st category, and the least common differences belong to the 4th category. Generally, the least common differences belong to the 2nd category, however, there is not a great difference in number of words between the 2nd, the 3rd and the 4th category in this investigation. Also, slightly misleading figures can be expected especially considering the great limitation of this investigation. The distribution of the words into the different categories hence proved to correspond quite well to the greater research made by Trudgill and Hannah (1985). Accordingly, the intended purpose of this essay has been fulfilled. I have investigated vocabulary differences between British and American English and found out that they indeed are very common also within the culinary area, and that the vast majority of the differences are of the type where different words are used for the same concept or item.

EE558	0	﻿ The monarchy - an archaic system Sweden has traditionally been a monarchy ruled by a sovereign Monarch. This did not change until the 19th century when Montesquieu's ideas were adopted to the Swedish constitution and the king had to share his powers with the politicians. The question whether a democratic country like Sweden should be a monarchy or not has been increasingly debated throughout the past century and culminated with a reform of the government in 1974. Then it was stated that the Monarch should be Sweden's Head of State. This means that his powers are very limited and mostly of symbolic value. The monarch's greatest power is that he is the first representative for the Swedish defence force and that he holds the highest grades of the defence. One could argue that the Monarch does not have any real political power and is therefore merely to be seen as an ambassador who travels round the world as a representative for his country. But there are many aspects of the monarchicalsystem and even though the Monarch's powers are very limited his or her position as the Head of State is of principal matter. Because the Monarch is given his title by heredity and is consequently not chosen by the people. This is the antithesis to the main thought of democracy, that the power emanates from the people. Another disturbing factor which interferes with the thought that all individuals are equal is that the Monarch historically has been looked upon as a divine ruler, that is a ruler chosen by God. And he does still today in our modern society stand above the grey mass of working- and middle class people. The Monarch is part of and in a way a symbol for the class society which is advancing rapidly. He does not have to prove that he has any kind of qualifications at all for his office. And it takes at least eight years and two votes in the Parliament if a monarch is to be removed from his office. Another aspect that is related to the Monarch's lack of qualifications is the economical part. The grant from the state to the royal household is as much as 37 million kronor each year. This sum is supposed to cover the costs for the Monarch's representation and the 75 persons who are employed by the Earl Marshal office and the divisions for computers, economy and press. Furthermore does the tax payers pay for the Governor office, that is administration of the royal castles and parks, and the Royal Chamber of Household Utensil, which includes administration and preservation of equipment and art collections. These two offices receive about 35 million kronor every year. The main reason to why a majority of Swedes are in favour of the monarchy is the enormous amount of attention that is paid on the royal family in the press. Members of the royal family are to be seen on the front covers of various magazines and newspapers. But the headlines are not always flattering, whit the scandal press digging deeper and deeper trying to find out anything that presumably would sell. And this not, and has never been, the purpose of the monarchy. The monarchical system is in many ways archaic and does not have validity in a modern, contemporary and democratic society. It can not be denied that the Monarch has a symbolic value which is of benefit to his country. But this does not mean that this uniting role can not be shouldered by someone else, like the politicians. It would definitely be more democratic if the Prime minister, who is chosen by the people, would be the head of state for the period that he or she is elected. This would open up the possibility for the people to remove a Head of State that does not have the people's symphaties. And the sum of 72 million kronor for the Monarch's costs could be used in sectors like education, health- and elderly care to benefit the whole society.$$$﻿This essay is dealing with my competence in English, assessing the four skills of reading, listening, writing and speaking. I will try to point out my strengths and weaknesses within these different fields mentioned above. I feel quite confident about reading in English, and because I have always enjoyed reading all sorts of books since I was a child, I have had a lot of practice as well. I guess that makes it a lot easier. I read a bit of English literature in my sparetime, mostly John Grisham's books, and even though they are a bit specialised, regarding the legal-terms and some American slang, I have never had a problem with them. I have also read a few poems, and they are much harder to understand, since they usually have a deeper meaning, which is harder to grasp if you have English as a second language, though in my opinion, a poem in English is easier to read then to listen to. If I am listening to a person giving a speech in English, I usually don't have much of a problem understanding what he or she is saying. If the accent is known for me, I don't have to concentrate much at all, if the person isn't talking exceptionally fast of course. 1996 I was an exchangestudent in Australia. Their accent was new to me and fairly different from the American and British ways of speaking. I remember that in the first week of school, I used to go home having the most dreadful headache from just listening to the teachers, trying to understand just what they were saying. After a while I got used to it of course, and now that is the accent that I feel most comfortable listening to, even though I myself have gone back to a mixture between American and British accents. When speaking a different language, Swedish people are afraid that they will have a funny accent, or that they will pronounce the words wrong so that someone might find their way of speaking amusing. I am no exception. The schools that I have been to didn't put much effort into teaching us how to speak the languages that we were so good at reading. Up until High School, I had a pretty large passive vocabulary, but the active one was nothing to be proud of. Then I went to Australia and suddenly I had to speak English, because otherwise nobody would understand me, or be interested in getting to know me. I think this is the best way to fully learn a language, actually being forced to speak it, and also, in my opinion, as soon as you get over that basic fear of failing, you will see that the important thing is not to get every little word in a sentence right, but to actually say that sentence and make yourself heard! As long as other people understand what you are saying, there is nothing to be afraid of at all. Of course, I still find it uncomfortable to speak English sometimes, and I rather write my friends back there a letter, than call them, and that is not only because of the phonebill... I like writing, but that doesn't mean that I am very good at it. I learnt a lot from my exchange year, but there are all sorts of different rules how the essays should be outlined, that I don't have a clue about. In Primary School and High School, you just sit down and write an essay, and there are no certain rules or outlines that you are supposed to know about. I think that is one of my biggest weaknesses. y greatest strength regarding this, is that I enjoy writing a lot. I haven't done a lot of writing in English, but since about Grade 3 I have been writing short-stories and poems in Swedish. When it comes to writing an essay with a prepared headline, I guess I don't enjoy it as much, but it is a bigger challenge of course. To sum this up, I think my English is pretty good in these four aspects, but I guess I will learn a lot from this semester of University.
EE254	1	﻿The aim of this essay is to evaluate my English. How competent do I feel about my English at the present time? Doing this I will estimate the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing in order to find out my strengths and weaknesses. Listening Generally I do not find it difficult to understand spoken English. Living in Sweden you are getting used to hear English in different situations for example at television and in musictexts and it is not unusual meeting English-speaking people. So even if you are not practising English that often you are getting used to hear the language. However, there are situations when English is not so easy to understand. I find it rather difficult to understand if a person speaks very fast or has a strange dialect. Different types of English are more or less easy to understand, British English is, for example, easier compared to American English. There may also be a problem to catch what people are saying when many people are talking at the same time. Reading One thing you do not have to think about reading English is the dialect or whether you are reading British or American English. This is partly why reading is even easier than listening. I do read a lot, both Swedish and sometimes English novels. Every now and then there has also been some course-literature in English. When I am reading novels I do it for pleasure. I do not consider it a pleasure to look every unknown word up in a dictionary. Doing that the novel does not get a whole. This is, of course, as long as I get the context from all the words that I do understand. If an unknown word comes up time after time I get curious and look it up. Sometimes, even if a single word is not important for my understanding, I want to know the meaning of it. It can simply be a good word, interesting because it looks nice or is nice to say or by any other reason. Reading is very good because it helps you to get into the language and get a feeling of it. Speaking In a way speaking is the best part of the four skills probably because you interact on other people and there is an immediate response in what you are saying. On the other hand I feel that speaking puts me in an exposed position where my weaknesses become very obvious. Compared to reading English, which gives me a feeling of being competent, speaking English often makes me feel limited in ways of finding the right words (my vocabulary is not big enough), talking to slowly or getting unsure about the pronunciation. Another difficulty in speaking English is to get the proper word order and the correct prepositions. I am also considering my intonation a bit too Swedish (maby I speak like someone from the "Muppet- Show"). Writing Except from letters I have not been writing in English since I went to upper secondary school (for more than twenty years ago!). I can not even remember anything that I have written in English. When it comes to writing my problems are very much the same as in speaking English. I have difficulties in finding the right words, getting the correct word order and the proper prepositions and other grammatical rules. However, there are some big differences between speaking and writing. Writing gives you more time for finding the right words, to check up the grammar rules and the rules of spelling. I also have the chance to read my text many times and to make revisions. Conclusion The aim of this essay was to find out how competent I feel about my English at this point. I would say that my skills in listening and reading are quite good compared to the skills in speaking and writing. I hope I can improve my English (all skills) by continuing to read and listen and by studying grammar and practise the active parts (speaking and writing) of the language.$$$﻿ ALLOW BASEBALL CAPS IN THE CLASSROOM There is a lively debate going on in Swedish schools whether to allow pupils to wear caps or whether to force them to take them off in class. The custom to wear a baseball cap has become very popular and many pupils do not take the cap off their heads when they enter the classroom. What young people wear has always been discussed by adults and teachers have even in the past reacted to how their students are dressed. Nevertheless, the discussion about the cap is much more upset than previous discussions. In some schools the debate is so intense that it has divided the school staff into two groups depending on the opinion on the matter. This is a rather complex issue and I will take up just two standpoints for allowing pupils to wear baseball caps in the classroom. First, clothing is a part of a young person's struggle for identity, second, the cap itself is not the problem, there are other reasons why teachers get so upset when pupils do not take off their caps. In the first place, young people try several ways to find out and show who they are or would like to be. For instance, music and sports are often important parts of their lives which they, naturally, have a need to express in different ways. In other words, a cap, often with a logotype showing what music style or sports team the wearer likes, is a way to show identity. It is no news that teenagers want to dress differently from adults. Not too long ago this could be done by wearing jeans and a sweater. This is not longer possible because it is the way any teachers dress nowadays. Strangely enough, the reaction to and the feelings about pupils wearing baseball caps in class seem more upset than, for example, the reactions to punk-rockers in the 1980s. One explanation of this is that the cap is a religious and social symbol. Traditionally, men take off their caps in church in order to show respect and generations of simple men have gone "cap in hand" to beg for their survival. Undoubtedly, this humility is what many teachers seem to want from their students in the 1990s. They feel provoked and not respectfully treated by pupils who wear caps in class. Of course, both teachers and pupils shall be met by respect in school. However, it is lack of respect to demand this humility from teenagers. School has to look upon every single pupil as an individual and to let this individual develop in her/his way. People who do not want the pupils to wear caps in class might ask where this is going to end, what are young persons wearing in2050, are things getting worse and worse? I would say that this is not the problem and it brings me to the next argument for allowing caps in the classroom. The reason why teachers get upset when pupils do not take off the cap is unclear. It may be argued that it is rude and impolite or that the pupil's eyes can not be seen. Still, the baseball cap has just become a symbol for more serious problems. It is mainly boys in caps that cause the teachers' irritation. Even this has its explanation in religious traditions, thus, men traditionally take off the caps while women keep their hats on in order to show respect in church. Owing to this, girls in baseball caps appear less provocative than boys. Furthermore, boys behave, in general, more provocatively than girls. It is not to be said that teachers are careless about the real problems. However, some teachers are more likely to deal with the cap-problem than to search the origin to why things do not work out well in the classroom. In conclusion, the baseball cap has become a bigger issue than it deserves. To wear a cap is, in most cases, a rather harmless way for young persons to show who they are. When teachers choose to focus their attention on whether pupils take off their caps or not, they are neglecting more serious problems. Eventually, in order to deal with the pupils of today teachers have to get rid of old traditions and face modern society.
EE513	1	﻿ TV-violence and children Violence has always fascinated people. During the earlier decades, violence has been used for entertainment, for example when executions were made in the public and crowds of people gathered. Today many people get in touch with violence through the medias, especially television. It has been discussed quite much whether the violence that occurs on TV affects children in a negative way. There are quite many persons doing research who think that that is the case, but there are also many persons doing research who do not believe so. The examinations that have been made on the topic do not give any clear answers to the question how violence on TV affects children. The only thing that can be determined about children and TV in general is that parents are recommended to watch TV together with their children. In that way the parents can explain violent situations and avoid that their children watch inappropriate programs. Violence on TV is increasing constantly. As mentioned earlier, the best thing for children is when they can watch TV together with their parents. Unfortunately there are not many parents today who have the time to do that. But they still want to protect their children fron watching TV-violence. In the United States the V-chip has been introduced as a solution to the problem. The V-chip measures the TV-violence on a scale from 1 to 4, and then it is up to the parent to decide which level of violence that will be permitted. In Sweden, the violencedescribing board also wants to introduce that kind of system. But the TV-channels are protesting against it. Opponents claim that it is a technically very complicated system which requires an enormous work of the TV-channels. And it is still not possible to say whether the system will work at all. I think that violence is something that will always exist in television. And television will always affect people in some kind of way, otherwise people would not watch television at all. Violence on TV does not always have to be a bad thing. Whether violence on TV is good or bad for children can certainly be discussed. I think that it could be a good idea to introduce a system that makes it possible to limit violence on TV for parents who do not have the time to watch TV with their children. But I think that TV-violence itself is not really a problem. The problem is that parents today do not spend enough time with their children generally. Television has become a cheap and always available baby-sitter in many households. The V-chip only makes it look like once violence can be taken away from TV, it is no longer a problem when children watch TV very much. To produce a chip is not really a solution of the problem with TV-violence. And with the grade-system, who will determine grades of violence in the programs? A computer? As a parent I would never rely on a chip to decide what would be appropriate for my children to watch. I do not think it is possible to make up different grades of violence either. Violence can not really be measured, especially not in television. Something that seems to be very violent to one person can seem harmless to another person. And children are individuals as well as adults. I think it is impossible to tell how a certain violent situation on TV affects children in general. Violence can certainly affect children, but to get the right picture of it violence has to be explained in the context where it occurs. And violence is not only used on television to frighten people or bring excitement to a story. It is often used to give a credible, realistic picture of reality, for example in documentaries. Should children be protected from violence in the first place? I think so, at least in some way. Movies made by adults, with very violent scenes, should maybe not be seen by children. It is the parents responsibility to see to that their children do not watch programs that are not good for them. Violence on TV appears in so many different forms and there are so many programs children should not watch until they are grown up. But it is very difficult to protect children from these programs. Violence will always be available for children, and if not on the TV at home maybe on the friends TV, or in newspapers, on the internet. If they would only be able to watch certain "non-violent" programs at their home, I think that they would still find out that there are also other exciting programs on television. And forbidden things of course make children curious. I remember when I was a child and my nephews were watching a horror movie on TV. They told me to watch it, too, and even though I was afraid of what I was going to see, I still could not let it be because I was so curios. I saw a horrible scene with a woman who had turned into some kind monster and lived in a basement. I was afraid of going down to our basement for months after that incident. Maybe it would have been a good thing if someone had stopped me from watching that movie. But it was an experience, and after a while I found out that there were no monsters living in basements. I think that more examinations should be made about how TV affects children. TV-violence was discussed a lot I think about two years ago, when a six-year-old boy was beaten to death by his classmates. It was discussed whether television was responsible for that tragedy. Many people thought that such a horrible thing would never have happened about a hundred years ago. Maybe the violence in television gives children a wrong view of the seriousness with violence? In animated films, the "hero of the story" usually never dies, no matter how much he has been hit. In reality, it is a fact that one strike can kill a person. But should television be made responsible for violence among children? I do not think so. I think it is of a much greater importance to try to talk to children about violence instead of trying to find someone to blame. Many children watch a lot of TV, but I do not really think that television plays a big part in childrens lives. If children become violent because they watch a lot of TV, the absence of the parents is probably the main reason rather than the violence on television. I do not think that it is possible to completely protect children from violence on TV. In the society of today children get in contact with violence in so many different ways, and home is no longer the only place where television can be watched. Television is available everywhere, and to prohibit TV-violence to protect children is probably not possible. Parents should take their responsibility and see which programs their children usually watch. I think that children of course should not be able to watch everything. Children should watch programs which are made for children, but not if violence is described as something harmless in them.$$$﻿ Grants instead of loans to go to university Education is the key to a working society. Unemployment has been and still is a hard problem for a society do deal with. The state quite often tries to get a better situation by encouraging people to get educated. The problem is not always the lack of vacant jobs but the lack of well-educated people. How come then that there are still quite few people who choose to go to university after high school? One main reason is probably that the system with loans does not attract people to get higher education. In Sweden students usually have to take loans to be able to finance their studies, especially if they are young and go to university directly after finishing high school. As a student you get a small amount of money from the state, a study grant. It is not very much money and certainly not enough to make a living. The students who do not take loans usually either live with their parents or somehow have the time to work while they study and finance their studies in that way. But combining studies mith work is not very common, as the loan system does not allow you to have an unlimited income during the studies. Otherwise the grants will be lowered. It is about the same thing concerning the study loans. You will not be able to borrow the full amount of money if the income has been too high during a year. That amount was in 1998 about 55 000 crowns. The main problem with taking a loan to finance the studies is that the present system makes it impossible for many students to ever be able to pay back the loan. You start to pay back your loan about six months after the finished studies. At present you pay four percent of what your income was two years ago when you start to pay back the loan. The problem is that the rent, which is made up by the government, usually is higher than four percent. As a consequence of that your loan grows while pay it off. At the age of 65, the loan will be written off. A lot of people presumably prefer to start to work after highschool instead of going to university. The problem with the loan system is probably one main reason. It is most probable that a lot of people prefer to earn their own money. That concerns especially young people who want to get a place of their own to live end become independent from their parents. A lot of people do not see the point in going to university and become indebted for the rest of their lives. Besides they miss their income during the time they study. Certainly, the loan does not have to be paid back in a way that it usually causes people financial troubles. But it must certainly be a psychological burden to be indebted and to be aware of that you will probably remain so for the main part of your life. Seeing it from another aspect, you can say that a loan is always a loan which has to be paid back. It gets more complicated when there is not only the studyloan that has to be paid back, but also other loans. The most common is that people take loans to buy an apartment or a house, maybe a car, furniture and other things. If then there is also a studyloan which has to be paid off, the financial situation can become very difficult. The loans that are given to be able to study are supposed to make it possible for everyone to study. But the fact is that a lot of people do not go to university because they simply cannot afford it. Especially single mothers have problems with that, because they beside themselves also have a child or children to provide for. The fact that no grants or loans are given over the summer quite often causes students more problems. During the summer vacacion a lot of students have to work to be able to make a living. The loan system makes it hard for people to earn money while studying, because the grants and the loan is reduced after you have earned more than the permitted annual amount. University students should be given grants, not loans, to finance their studies. If university students would be given grants and not loans, more people would probably choose to go to university. Now there are probably those who think that it is not the same thing to study at university as to work. It is not, but full time studies actually can be compared with a full time job. The only difference is that you are able to use your time more freely as a student and that you get occupation in a different kind of way. But there are always tasks which have to be done when you study, and you always have things to do. The conditions for working and studying are different, but there are also close points of similarity between them. Why should more people go to university then? There are many reasons. Society is always in need for well educated people. Education leads to development in the whole society. If grants instead of loans were introduced, it would probably tempt more people to go to university. The attitude to higher education would probably change. University studies do not always lead to a well-paid job, but a lot of people do study because it is stimulating for the personal development. In the long run it would favour everyone. If the loans were not a negative part of university studies university itself would probably be seen as more useful and accessible to everyone. The system of today does not work properly anyway. It should be an advantage to go to university and not a disadvantage, financially as well as intellectually. I think that the whole system with the study allowences is in need for a change. Politicians always emphasize the importance of education, therefor higher education should not leed to debts. The unemployment would probably decrease if more people could go to university. It is never wrong of society to stake on education. Education is an investment for the future.
EE252	1	﻿ slavery system of modern times To force people to do unpaid work in the public sector to receive unemployed benefit, I think indicate a very cynical outlook of unemployed people. If jobs exists within the public sector people should be employed and get proper paid for their work. If on the other hand the jobs will be created just to serve the purpose of keeping unemployed people bussy and the assignments are not enough important to employ people to do them. That would be a even more condescending way of treating people. If the first condition is the applicable and you carry matters to an extreme, it would ultimately be to force people to reduce their own abilitys of getting a real job. Though in both the cases i think that coerce people to work in order to get their uneployment benefit would be a slavery system of modern times. Forcing people to take a unpaid job it's to questoning their ability to decide for their own good. I also think that it's a way of questioning peoples character, thinking that they would just lay back and don't make any efforts to improve their situation if they weren't forced to do otherwise. I think on the whole that the state should be very carefully with interfering to much within peoples life. Peoples which prefer to use their time they have when they are unemployed to search jobs, improve their skills in different areas, or just be thinking of what they want to do with their future, should have that ability. When you get unemployed you commonly loose a great deal of your selfconfidence and your human dignity, if you than are being forced to work more or less for free, with something that you doesn't feel happy with and which doesn't suit your personality, it doesn't exactly raise your self-confidence or inspire you in any positive way. I also believe that there's a risk, if the first thing you have to do when you become unemployed is to begin to work full-time in the public sector, that after a while you don't feel that you have the strenght of both working full-time and search for a new jobb. My own experience, of have being unemployed and worked for "free" in the public sector (My own choise), is that in a coupel of months you don't have the energy or motivation to search jobs very actively. And this observance also applys to other unemployed people I've met. Though I think that the unemployed people who wants to do unpaid work should have the opportunity to do that. But considering that it can be easier to search for jobs when you have more time for it, a legislation that you in order to get the unemployment benefit must work for "free", would make it even harder for some people to get a real job. The good thing about unemployed people working in the public sector would be that they get some work experience and references. But than again, if the work is really nessecary to be done why not employ unemloyed people instead of using them as free worker, and give them the money and security that comes with a real job. Otherwise It's like saying that the work people are forced to do haven't got any real value. To sum up I think the idea of forcing people to work in the public sector in order to get their unemployment benefit would be a encroachment that doesn't belong in a free and democratic society. You shouldn't underestimate peoples power of initiative and ambition to improve their situation. And you also have to consider that unemployed people are individuals with different needs so you can't apply just one solution to the problem with unemployment, it would be to simplificate a very complexed issue.$$$﻿ Children's access to violence in media assproduced Disney series, strident content, no message and humour that applies to adults. Much can be said about today's children's programmes but the most urgent thing to pay attention to though I think is the increased rate of violence in the programmes and movies directed to children and the free access to adult programmes and films with violence in them. Maybe the worst thing isn't the violence itself but the romanticizing of it, the macho ideals and prototypes that might be entertaining at film but can not be seen as desirable ideals in real life. Emotional strongly simplifications can be necessary and good for children in order to create sense and coherence like in many fairy-tails were life consists of good and bad but it becomes dangerous when the setting applies to much to the real world and children are supposed to have the same ability as adults to sort out fiction from what's real. When children are more allowed to look at programmes made for adults the risk is that the children's programmes also starts to adapt to more violence scenes and a rougher outline to keep its number of viewers and there is also the compete among the commercial channels of their younger viewers. In effort to attract more viewers the channels increase the rate of violence in their programmes. If I compare my impression of television in childhood with the imression of today's television I've noticed that there is a great pressure among parents of today to allow their children more or less free access to television. To not allow children to watch adult movies it's beginning to be seen as being unnecessary hard and severe. With today's free access to violence in television is that children prefers the most violent films and it has become high-status to see the worst films and series. In USA the support grows for a so called V ship (for anti- violence ship) a technology that would allow parents to lock out programs previously identified by having a certain level of violence. To many legislators and others concerned about TV violence the V ship seems a neat solution to the problem asserting parental control and reacently a bill was passed in the Senate calling for broadcasters to devise their own rating system within a year. And although a risk can be seen in this form of increased government control of people's television habits It's has to be seen as a very effective and painless way of reducing children's access to violence in television. And even if we in Sweden still have two public channels with government control I think we have came to a point with all new commercial channels comming where theres's a need to reconsider a incorporation of the V ship system in Swedish television also. Considering what a big impact television has in the way it colour and shape our picture of life and whether we like it or not works as an education, in USA children per average spend more hours in front of television than in school, it's scaring that the offering rules of not by what's good for children but what's good for profit. A fact that become alarming when you consider the increased rate of violence and sexual outrage made by and to very young children in recent time. Children are much more easily affected by violence than adults, they haven't got the same ability to select among their expressions and their perception is more open and less selective. Parents and government stand in front of a great challenge when it comes to take responsibility for how the next generation is being shaped.
EE099	0	﻿ The Increasing Number of Swedish People Living in England When I first came to England nine years ago I was, if not unique, certainly a curiosity. Well this is not entirely true, since it was my first time to England without my family maybe the curiosity was all on my behalf but there were not as many Swedes living in London, nor other parts of Britain, as there is today. If you walk around in central London for a while you will hear someone speak Swedish sooner rather than later. They might be tourists, depending on where you are and what time of the year we are talking about, but nevertheless there is a large, ever growing contingent of Swedish people in England today. The Question one might ask is why would anyone, apart from the Vikings and Ulrika Jonsson who went to conquer, move somewhere where your water comes in one pipe for hot and one for cold? I can however acknowledge a few reasons for people like myself moving to the United Kingdom. In my case I went to study, maybe not as much at the University I was enlisted at but more like studying the culture/people and also improve my English and learn more about myself. More and more people though decide to study abroad for all kinds of reasons and England is the most popular choice since we all know at least some English. We also have similar education at higher level which makes it easier to synchronise whatever it is that we study. Some of my friends took voluntary jobs or worked as nannies so that they also could experience living in a culture that interested them. We are very well regarded abroad and a lot of people do not mind being paid less than they would be back in Sweden because they see it as a temporary thing or more like a vacation. All of them recognise England as the place to go to if you are interested in things such as football, music or fashion. London has always attracted young people from all over and since British culture and society is similar to Swedish it is not that a big step to take, it is also fairly close and not very expensive to go there. There is also an increasing number of Swedish businessmen working in England. This is due to both 1) Swedish companies moving their offices so they can get closer to their markets and/or escaping Swedish Tax laws or 2) the general internationalisation of the work force which results in that qualified personnel move to wherever they can get the best terms. It also helps that the economy in Britain has been booming for the last few years. For all the different kinds of people mentioned above it has become a lot easier to move and work within Europe since we joined the European Community. This is possibly the biggest reason for the increase of Swedish Citizens in the UK and it is a noticeable change just over the last 5 years. In fact all people I know who lives or have lived in England moved there in 1995 or after. Definitely not the biggest reason and a reason which I do not have any hard evidence of but what seems to be the case is that a lot of Swedish girls get involved with English guys. This can also explain the marginal but noticeable increase of English men in Sweden. The more integrated Europe will get the more we will travel and move within. Since there is so much for us to do and see in Britain and as long as the economy stays strong then I can not see any reasons for it not to continue. In the end I guess we will take over where the Vikings stopped and turn the whole place into a colony.$$$﻿ MEAT-CONSUMPTION IS DECREASING ore and more people in Europe chose not to eat meat or they eat less meat than before. The amount of vegetarians and vegans and the hesitation towards meat as food has increased severely during the last decade. In Sweden, according to are cent poll performed by SIFO, 40% of the population is hesitant and 20% has stopped eating meat as a result of the recent debate. I know you are probably fed up with this issue by now since it has been discussed and debated in media and amongst us for quite a while now, I know I am. But is this just a trend passing through our society and our minds like a fashion-whim or is it a development sprung out of a deeper and more complex context? Why are we eating less meat? The most obvious reason for this development is all the reports about the meat-industry and BSE or "the crazy-cow decease" as we call it. That is a terrible name by the way. The poor cows are not crazy they suffer from a deadly and humiliating decease. We don't call it "the crazy-human decease" when it infects people. In 1994, in Great Britain, the first human was diagnosed to have the human variant of BSE, Creutzfeldt Jacobs decease, and in 1996 the connection between this and BSE was established by scientists and that eatingmeat from infected animals was the means of contamination. This put the meat industry in focus and frequent reports in media about emergency slaughter in Britain with pictures of piles with dead cows about to be burned, reports about the terrible conditions under which the animals were transported or kept and how the animals were treated only as an inanimate part of a money-making murder-machine and not as individual creatures able to feel pain. Naturally this makes people upset and makes people think about what there is they are eating, about the ethic aspect of the issue and whether to keep on supporting this system or not. edia's part in this development is of great importance. Media is providing us with the information that we otherwise wouldn't have access to. The power-position media has in today's society is not to be underestimated. Sometime ago there was a documentary broadcasted on Swedish television. It was about how animals were treated in Belgium. I should mention that I haven't seen this particular film myself but I have been told about it and I have seen other films also dealing with animal-treatment. You could say that this film was the trigger to the current debate that has been taking part during the past months. The newspapers have been filled with articles and letters to the editor about this horrible documentary and about the question whether to eat meat or not. People were naturally upset and media continued to arouse the people with articles, editorials and by collecting names by publishing lists where several celebrities already had signed their names in order to stop the cruelty to animals. I am not saying that this is bad I am just pointing at media's part in the development that I am discussing. ore and more people in Sweden chose not to eat meat. The previously mentioned causes is of course important aspects on this issue. But this is not something that has happened now all of a sudden even if now is when it is discussed. This development has been in progress for a long time. The number of vegetarians has increased, mostly among younger people. Our awareness of the world surrounding us, the environment and our fellow-earthlings, has increased and we now realise that we can't go on living as if we were the absolute rulers of the Universe. We have learnt that there are consequences of our actions that affects everything and that we can't ignore anymore. The human intellect has taken us so far in our development as a species. We know how our bodies function and we also know a lot more about the food we are eating. Food has a central part in our lives. Of course it has. We would die without it. But now we know about vitamins, about minerals, calories, fat, fibres and all the other things our food contains of and we also know what we need. We know that meat no longer is a necessity for the human body to survive. We can replace it with other foods without missing out on important proteins and other substances that our body needs and where meat has been a main-source. We are no longer predators that hunt for our survival. We have turned the hunt into an industry. We are enlightened with knowledge that we didn't have before and we have probably lost a lot of our old instincts. What I am trying to say is that this can be a natural step in our evolutional development as human beings. But I am no scientist and to prove this theory I would have to be able to look into the future, a couple of hundred thousand years or so. No human being can do that. Yet.
EE551	0	﻿ Down with the King I claim the king together with the entire royal family do not belong in a democratic country as Sweden. Ever since almost anyone can remember we have had a king who in... some sense has governed Sweden. But times have changed. It is with no hesitation that I argue for Sweden to leave our monarchy influenced constitution and there will be no doubt you will agree with me after reading this essay. The king of Sweden does not posses any real power in that way he can make decisions on national or even local levels. The country of Sweden, so to say, employs him. On the surface you can easily believe he is just a face out towards the people of Sweden and other countries, holding speeches and cutting band at opening ceremonies. The powers possessed by the king are not that obvious. Our king possesses power. In fact he is one of Sweden's most influent opinion-makers. As a king he gets lots of attention from media, which makes him very powerful. The power he possesses is, without any doubts, due to the fact that he is king, a position that he has inherited. No matter if he likes it or not he influences the people a lot with his actions and statements; he is a powerful leader of peoples minds. The question is if whether a democratic country like Sweden can have a strong opinion-maker that inherit his power. It is with my biggest convention that I maintain that that this is totally against all thinking in a democratic country. It makes me feel ill at ease when I think of power that is inherited, and of course that cannot be acceptable. Just to emphasise this main and very crucial point, a hereditary position that entails great power over the people does not belong in a democratic country. We must never forget the importance of that, thus we cannot have a king who inherit his position. Of course there might be some people that do not see the issue. Some may say "-Yeah, yeah. He might influence the opinion, but I like him though. He is nice." The king is popular, especially amongst the elderly in our society. The king is a down-to-earth person with simple hobbies that many of the elderly can identify with. Hence it might be hard to see why anybody would have a problem with this harmless fellow. So let me give an example why I am concerned with the way he influences the thinking of people's minds. One of his hobbies is to hunt. Every year he goes hunting elk. I am one of those people who do not eat meat because I do not consider us humans to have any right to eat other animals. Every now and then we follow the king broadcasted on television, out hunting elk with his ever happy and smiling hunting friends. This portrait of the king and his habits strengthen the right to act in a manner, which I consider awkward. To hunt down and kill animals righteous many peoples habits of eating meat and killing animals. There is no way I just can sit back and watch this man, the man who should represent the whole country, without reacting. I do not want that man to represent Sweden, but there is nothing I can do about it. This argumentation essay is not about issues concerning eating meat or not, nonetheless I think I have maid my point clear. A man employed by the country of Sweden ought to express the opinions of the majority and hence has to be elected by the people. With this not said we would have someone we would all like, but that is the way it has to work in a democratic country. So to conclude my standpoint I have to say there can be no place for inherited monarchy in a democratic country like Sweden. A man in this position has to represent the people. It is not acceptable that a man possessing power as a direct cause by the fact that he is employed by the country of Sweden is not elected by us all.$$$﻿According to the number of years that I have studied English, one could assume that I would be able to read, speak, write and communicate with other people without having any massive difficulties. I really do wish that it would be that simple. In a way it is true that my English is in a stable state where I am confident to use it in every day basis and also to be able to study dissimilar subjects in English. Regarding to the fact that I come from Finland and my mother tongue is so unlike comparing to the other languages explains somehow my incomplete knowledge from foreign languages. In my native language, Finnish that is, we do not have for instance any prepositions or articles. These grammar dissimilarities creates insuperable barriers for me that has perhaps something to do with my laziness and a lack of concentration. I presume that I have not even learned the basic things throughout even though language teaching is highly appreciated in Finland. I guess that learning a new language properly from the beginning, in this content English, would have helped me to achieve a firm and a strong standard that I would be able to use English in sort of a native way. If I start with listening I am happy to inform that this particular skill is presumably my strongest. During the few years I have had a chance to be in a sort of environment that people have used different accents and dialects that I have become accustomed to listen. Certainly I have to admit that even still today I have to apologize occasionally when I am not able to comprehend despite my background abroad. But then again it is quite logical that I have to ask people to repeat themselves because I am a foreign and I will never become a fully bilingual person. Besides one has to be really careful when listening for example to a strong Scottish accent or if having a conversation with a real Paddy. Separations between different accents are enormous. Apparently my reading comprehension is rather good as well. When reading a newspaper, a magazine or a book I do not need to reach out my dictionary although there are words which meanings I do not have a slightest clue. But that does not matter because one is able to guess their meaning of the context. Reading in English would be quite simple if having a vast vocabulary because the alphabets are normal if making a comparison to our Scandinavian alphabets. Usually what happens during the language learning progress is that it is much easier to imbibe passively everything new than produce the new language actively by yourself. Generally people might be afraid of using the new language or feel embarrassment if making mistakes. That does not happen to me because I seriously do think that as long as I am able to socialize with people with my incomplete English is all that matters to me. I do not bother when I realise that I have made some easy mistakes or my pronunciation has not been perfect. y writing skills are rather insufficient which really annoys me because when ever I do write essays or even just letters to my mates abroad I feel myself disabled. My capacity is not adequate and I do not have any talent for writing and believe me this negativity has nothing to do with my low self-confidence. The weakest point in my English is the academic writing. I do not know how to use long and sophisticated words which would link a subordinate clause and a main clause easily together. The structure in my written English is poor which is sad to admit but that is the truth. After all these years of studying English and using it in practice and yet not having more fluency with it, leaves me disappointed with a great frustration. The fact is that English is a quite complicated language but still I should have learned it better. Unfortunately I have come to a conclusion that my knowledge of English will not come to improve. I have not given up yet and I refuse to do so in the future but I am sure that this enormous frustration will continue no matter what.
EE095	0	﻿ The Decline of the Birth-rate in Sweden A negative trend that can be observed in the Swedish society of today is the decline of the birth-rate. In 1990 the number of children born in Sweden was 120 000, in 1994 it was 110 000 and in 1998 it was as low as 89 000. The number of deceased persons was 95 000, 92 000 and 93 000 respectively - in other words, there is an excess of deaths over births. At the same time the total population of Sweden increased from 8,6 million people in 1990 to 8,8 million in 1994 and to 8,9 million in 1998. These statistics, which I have obtained from the homepage of the SCB illuminate this trend very clearly. But what are the reasons for this phenomenon? The main cause of the low birth-rate is the economic situation. It is simply too expensive for many people to bring up children in our society. Therefore family planning has become usual. The possibility to avoid unwanted pregnancies through preventives or the alternative to go through a legal abortion has of course had a very great impact on the birth-rates. The child allowance far from cover the loss of income during pregnancy, maternity leave and all other expenses involved when raising a child. Many couples decide to become parents later in life after having obtained a good job and earned some money and paid off their debts. Sometimes the decision is made too late and others never reach the point in life when they decide that the time to bring children into the world has come. Furthermore, women's position in society has gone through a radical change. Formerly a woman was expected to give birth to children and take care of the household. These were her major tasks in life. Nowadays women have the opportunity of achieving the same positions in business and professional life as men. Consequently, this has influenced the female way of life. After compulsory school an increasing number of young men and women continue their studies, at university for example. The studies often take many years to complete and giving birth to a child during that time is not what most women desire. After the studies quite a few women want to make a carrier and when they intend to climb the ladder of success children are not considered convenient. Thus women neither have the time nor want to raise children. It has now become more socially accepted than earlier to have a carrier instead of choosing ordinary family-life if you cannot combine them. What may the effects of this decline of the birth-rate be? The most terrifying aspect is that it makes the economy of the country weak. This may need some further explanation. The number of people above the age of 60 was in 1990 18% of the total population in the OECD-countries (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) and statisticians have reached the conclusion that the number will be 30% in 2030. In other words, the number of retired people will increase and thus the state-budgets will have to be used to take care of old people instead of the younger generation. This will lead to reduced contributions as regards education and the consequence will be a deteriorated school-system. The result will be a generation of people without sufficient education. Swedish know-how will decrease and thus weaken the Swedish economy. Also other contributions, for instance means for the infrastructure and the military, will diminish and the country will slowly begin to decay. Nevertheless, the troublesome problem with unemployment will fade away when the workers of today retire and their professional posts must be filled. Provided that the school-system still is satisfactory the young people will have no difficulty in finding jobs. This will, hopefully, lead to a rapid development in society and Sweden will catch up with what was lost during the time of "depression". In the long run this decreasing rate of nativity might be very healthy for the economy of the country, but the change should take place at a slower pace than it does at the moment. Attempts have been made from the government to encourage people to have more children. In conclusion this trend of decline of the birth-rate is due to the difficult economic situation of the last years. Lately signs indicate that the economic situation is improving and if this is the case, the birth-rate most certainly will improve. The fact that women make carriers probably does not influence the birth-rate as much as the economic situation does.$$$﻿ Is exercise getting trendy? During the last few years of my living in Uppsala I have noticed a change in the way students, and I believe others, get their exercise. About four years ago there were not that many different alternatives for people wanted to get fit. Friskis & Svettis and the reverend Svettis were the main alternatives, both quite cheap then. But several other fitness centres began popping up, or rather began marketing, rebuilt and asked higher prices. The students who earlier were hard put to pay 350 Swedish crowns for their exercise now pay from 900 up to 1200. Svettis is rebuilt into Stallet, the old Centralbadet into Nautilus and Friskis & Svettis have enlarged their organisation. My Ju-Jutsu beginners' course was, according to the teacher, the largest in several years, and almost everyone stayed the whole course. These changes must be caused by a greater willingness of the inhabitants of Uppsala to get fit and pay for it. It may be that this is caused by some trend in society at large but as all my observations emanate from Uppsala I have to treat it as a local trend albeit affected by the environment. Could it be that suddenly, because of the reports of the dangers of being fat when older, like heart failure, students start thinking of their future old age and start exercising. Or the reports on the ever higher percent of the young which is overweight combined with advice on how to loose weight? That would mean that we read the newspapers, believe in the journalists' and experts' conclusions and follow their advice willingly in the hope of living into a healthy old age and in the bargain lower the statistics. Unfortunately, or not, it does not really fit our mindset to react that way. Where it so, we would use only half our allotted students' loan, drink not at all, go to bed at ten and eat eight to nine slices of bread a day, which we don't. Therefore it is probably not the influence of the newspapers that is the main cause. On the other hand, it could be another kind of paper that has finally reached through and got us to follow their advice; the tabloids with their tips on how to get thin. But that is probably not correct either as those tips usually only include eating less, not exercising more, and if training is included, it does not extend over more than ten minutes a day. It also seems like the training trend includes male students, who supposedly would not be as affected the tabloids, since they are mainly read by women. Several decades ago, e.g. in the forties, it was usual for people, male and female both, to carry clothes or undergarments which worked like a corset to keep an untrained body looking fit. Nowadays, however, we wear scanty clothes which mercilessly reveal if fitness is lacking while at the same time the beauty ideal is to be thinner than ever, most believe (I believe it looks rather like the 1400th - century). Owing to this it is probably more important than ever to be able to show a torso not only without fat but also lined with muscles. Even the female photo models are starting to look more trim than thin. At the same time it gets more usual for men and women to bodybuild. It is possible that feminism is one of the reasons. It is now possible for a woman to be strong and still beautiful and it is possible for a man to be vain. I am sure these are important reasons for the fitness trend but probably not the most important. It is still possible to starve into clothes, even if it probably is less fun. There is another health aspect in this matter. Studies have shown, at least according to the students' health organisation, that exercise increases the concentration span and thereby it should make it easier to study. It is probable that at least most students who start exercising discover that they get more energised and can study for longer time periods without tiring. The reason for the trend is probably a combination of the causes listed above, together with another interesting factor. It has finally become fashionable to exercise, the fitness centres are meeting places and people like to speak of and discuss where and what they do for exercise, and they want to spend money on it. It is also interesting to note the counter reaction: people that are so tired of the fitness talk that they refuse to exercise at all and simply don't care. One thing is certain; as long as this health and training wave continues it will probably be possible to ask ever higher prices of us and the only effect is that more people will attend exercise facilities. Or, as the marketing rule goes according to Kotler, there are certain goods that more people buy when the price goes up, and this might just be one.
EE096	0	﻿ Mind your language I agree with Shirley Peckhams article "Cleaning up the Language". Children should not swear and neither should adults. In this article I will deal with three reasons why cursing is superfluous. The first reason is that it prevents our vocabulary from growing. Secondly it offends a lot of people to hear swear words. And thirdly, when offended people might not listen to what you have to say and the message that you had will not reach them. We do not need the swear words because there are other words that we could use instead of them. Using these words would extend our vocabulary and that would give us a language with greater variations. This extended and varied language would help us to be more precise in expressing ourselves. And it is really very helpful to have the right words in many situations. Swear words are actually not so useful, since they do not carry that much of a meaning. What these words do is mainly emphasizing or strengthening another word and that could be done in other ways. Another reason not to swear is that we should be considerate towards other people. Hearing a person swearing frequently is offensive to a lot of people, Shirley Peckham is one of them, as she wrote in her article. Therefore, I think that out of respect for other people we should be careful about what words we use. This is the same kind of respect as the one we show by not walking around naked even though it is a hot summer day. We do not undress in public because it would offend a lot of people, and I think it is the same thing with swearing. To spare people from feeling disgusted, as Shirley Peckham, we should search for other, less offensive words when we speak. The third reason why we should not swear is mainly for our own sake. If we offend people with our language they might not listen to what we have to say, that way the message that we have will not come through to them. And the purpose of speaking is to be heard and understood. Furthermore, we do ourselves a favor by not swearing since a person with a pleasant and varied vocabulary seems more reliable than someone who needs swear words to explain what he or she thinks. Therefore, if swearing makes people stop listening, then what is the point of speaking at all? Swearing is completely unnecessary. That is what I wanted to say with this essay and I have used three arguments to convince you. I think that if we do not use swear words we will have to search for other words, and that would increase our vocabulary with words that are more useful to us. Useful since it makes it easier for us to explain what we mean in different situations. As swear words is regarded as unpleasant by several people we should use other words in order not to be inconsiderate and rude to them. When we swear we make these people stop listening, and in order to make as many persons as possible listen we must have a vocabulary used by the majority, and swearing is not accepted by most people. Besides, whatever your message is it is easier to convince others that you are right if your language is decent.$$$﻿ SCOTS; A DIALECT OR A LANGUAGE INTRODUCTION When looking at Scots it can sometimes be a bit confusing. Is it a language of its own or is it just a dialect of English? The answer to that question may differ depending on who you ask. Among linguistics the view is rather ambiguous, one person may argue convincingly for both opinions and it is easier to get a clear cut answer if one turns to the various organisations promoting Scots. In their opinion there is only one answer; Scots is not and never was a dialect of English. My aim in this essay is to take a closer look into the Scots language, why this ambiguity exists, how it started and if there is a tendency for the future of Scots. I will use the word Scots for the traditional Scots language, as compared to the other two languages that exist in Scotland; Scottish English and Scottish Gaelic. I have mainly used material provided by the linguistics Charles Barber, The English Language, David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language, and J.C. Wells, Accents of English 2, but I have also consulted various Internet sources for additional material and a closer look into what is happening to Scots today. ORIGIN AND HISTORY Regardless of how one may treat this ambiguity it all goes back to the fact that, compared to other dialects of English, Scots has a very special history. Scots has been a language of its own and at that time it was used as the first language in Scotland. The history of Scots begins in the fifth century with the conquest of the Anglo-Saxon tribes. Quite a few of the Angles settled in southern Scotland and their Germanic language is the origin of Scots.1 By the eleventh century Scots was a language of its own, separated from English2, and it reached its peak in the sixteenth century, but the decline began shortly after.3 When James I of Scotland became James VI of England in 1603 and moved southwards the English influence in Scotland gradually increased since "London [now] became the centre from which patronage radiated." 4 The strong literary tradition that existed in Scots diminished and by the time the parliaments in Scotland and England were united, in 1707, it was virtually non-existent.5 With the Union of the Parliaments English became the official language in writing, leaving Scots to be, more or less, a spoken language. In the eighteenth century there was a revival of literature written in Scots, but England had by then had such an impact on Scotland that the outcome was quite the opposite. English spelling conventions were more and more being used for Scots and this further contributed to the belief that Scots just was a dialect of English.6 The resurrection of Scots in our days has been more thorough and it has been augmented with magazines, books, dictionaries etc; but I will return later to Scots present day position. First I will turn to differences between Scots and English. DIFFERENCES Here I will present two examples of written Scots from different time periods. Due to lack of space I can not investigate them as thorough as I would want, but they will clearly show how distinct written Scots is from written English. First, an example of Scots written by Robert Henryson in the fifteenth century: This wylie tod, quhen that the lark couth sing, Full sair hungrie vnto the town him drest, Qhuair Chantecleir, in to the grey dawning, Werie for nicht, wes flowen fra his nest. Lowrence this saw, and in his mynd he kest The ierperdies, the wayis, and the wyle, Be quhat menis he micht this cok begyle.7 This was written in the prime days of Scots when it was the main language in Scotland. Compared with an example of English literature from the fourteenth century by Chaucer one can see that Chucer's text is closer to present day English. e thinketh it accordant to resoun To telle you al the condicioun Of eech of hem, so as it seemed me, And whiche they were, and of what degree, And eek in what array that they were inne: And at a knight thanne wol I first biginne.8 The example by Chaucer is easier to read because many of the words resemble their present day form. Words like 'thinketh' and 'biginne' present no difficulties, and even though the syntax is slightly awkward to us we still understand what Chaucer means. Henryson's text is a bit more difficult to comprehend. The English spelling wh- is spelled with quh- in Scots and words like 'tod', 'kest' and 'wyle' does not correspond to their English counterparts 'fox', 'ponder' and 'stratagem'. However, many of the words in the extract by Henryson are not difficult to understand. Words like 'hungrie' and 'toun' may seem misspelled to us, but we still understand them. Finally, an example of Scots written this year, taken from an Internet site promoting the language: Aa richts is pitten by. Nae pairt o this darg shuid be doobelt, hained in onie kin o seistem, or furthset in onie kythin or bi onie gate whitsomeiver, athoot haein leave frae the writer afore-haund. A hae nae pleens whan the abuin is duin for tae fordle the Scots leid in eddication, sae long's naebodie is makkin siller oot o't. 9 This example, a text on copyright, is perhaps quite different from the Scots example from the fifteenth century, but the spelling of -ch, corresponding to the English form -gh, is used in both extracts in the words 'micht', 'nicht' and 'richt'. Furthermore, the spelling is now very different from English; and words like 'darg', 'leid' and 'siller', meaning 'work', 'language' and 'money', have no affinity with their English counterparts. These examples show, though briefly, that written Scots, as any language, has changed over the years, but that it always has distinguished itself from English. With the Anglicisation, the English domination, written Scots also started to alter within Scotland. It lacked a unified way of spelling and this further contributed to the dispersion of Scots. Its position as a language was weakened and it became treated more and more as a dialect of English. SCOTS OF TODAY "Scots must be re-created [...] and de-Anglicised".10 This comment was made by a man named Hugh MacDiarmid in 1926 and he can perhaps stand as the founder of the revival of Scots in our century. The spoken forms of Scots had survived the Anglicisation although pronounciation had changed over the years creating several dialects of Scots. The absence of a standardised way of writing Scots led to a spelling that followed the pronounciation, and, thus, varied within the country.11 However, the revival initiated by MacDiarmid aimed at creating a standardised way of writing Scots and thereby made this revival more than just literary. When the linguist Charles Barber writes about this he says: "having a dialect literature [...] is not the same as having a standard literary language: when Middle Scots was a standard literary language, all written transactions (if not in Latin) were carried out in it. But since the eighteenth century this has not been so: there have been works of literature in Scots, but the history-books and the contracts and the chemistry-books have been written in what is essentially the southern literary language".12 The result of the recreation became known as 'synthetic' or 'plastic' Scots because it was a reconstruction of the language. It has also been called Lallans because it "looked to previous literary and dialect usages from the Scottish Lowlands for its distinctiveness".13 Lallans stands for Lowlands. Nevertheless, the 'Scottish Renaissance' had started and today it is stronger than ever. In 1983 the New Testament was translated into Scots. In 1985 the Scottish National Dictionary Association had put together the Concise Scots Dictionary and there is also a larger, 10 vol., Scottish National Dictionary. In education the trend is also noticable. Both Scots literature and language are encouraged in education policies today, some universities teach in Scots and in 1996 the Kist was finished. It is an anthology on Scots and it also contains guidelines for teachers. The Kist was set up by the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum. Scots is also promoted by several other organisations, and the General Register Office in Scotland estimated the number of Scots speakers at 1.5 million in 1996. However, according to the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages the language retains no legal status or protection14 and it has "not so far been able to make inroads into the use of Standard English as the language of power and public prestige"15. J.C. Wells says, quite appropriately, in Accents of English 2 that "Scots, according to one's point of view, can be considered either a group of dialects of English, or a distinct language".16 It seems, that for Scots to be a language unconditionally, it has to standardise, or at least harmonise, spelling and writing and, moreover, it has to regain the areas where English has been the dominante language for the last four centuries. CONCLUSIONS Languages will always affect each other. England once borrowed heavily from French, but today English is a world language supplying the rest of the world in many areas. Scots may never be a world language, it has been struggling to survive under the pressure from English for a long time, but today more groups than ever are promoting Scots. This quotation is from one group; "for a nation to regain its soul it must also regain its language".17 If true, one can perhaps say that Scotland lost its soul for four hundred years, but that today the people of Scotland are eagerly trying to restore it.

EE555	0	﻿ Meat verses vegetables: arguments for a vegetarian lifestyle Some people say that meat is murder. Is it? Whether you like the expression or not, you can not escape from the fact that meat comes from a dead animal and in one way or another the animal has been killed. If it has not died of natural causes which is quite rare when it comes to the meat that we eat. This essay will not further take up the discussion about murder or not murder but it will try to give you reasons not to eat meat. Because my conviction is that there are a lot of good reasons. I have been a vegetarian for about four and a half years and I have had to answer the question "why a vegetarian" quite a few times. Therefore I'm now about to give you some of my arguments. The first reason I want to share is that I don't want to support the meat industry. Because an industry is what it has become. The questions this industry seems to be dealing with are for example; How can we make a bigger profit? How can we produce a large amount of meat in a short time? How can we feed the chickens so they grow fat but still not so fat that they die of a hart attack? How can we fit in as many pigs as possible in one place without them dying of distress? So it seems like animals are looked upon as food from the day they are born until the day they die. People usually does not like to know about how animals are slaughtered or how they are treated during transportation. Some people does not even want to hear the word pig in connection with a meal consisting of bacon. To be able to eat meat with a clean conscience it seems like you have to keep the distance. I think that is a bit hypocritical. (Of course there are exceptions among public). Are we not able to take responsibility of our own actions? The meat industry is - like all other industries - about money. Almost no matter on what costs that means for the animals. Does the animals not deserve more respect from human beings who reckons themselves to be on a higher level? I definitely think that they do. This does neither mean that I think that animals and human beings are totally equal nor does it mean that I think they are supposed to have the same rights. What I do think is that we are abusing our position and treating animals in a bad way. I don't want to support that. In fact we don't need to eat meat to survive. Of course there are good things like protein and minerals in meat. But that is not something that you can not find elsewhere. Beans, chickpeas and lentils are all rich of protein. If you are a vegetarian but still eat eggs and drink milk you don't have to worry at all the lacking of protein. It is not that complicated to eat nutritiously. You just have to be observant that you have a varied diet. The thing is that it's not only ourselves as individuals that gets healthier with a vegetarian lifestyle. If we did not have to feed as many beef cattle as we do right now we could instead feed people that are starving. It is a real energy loss taking so many steps in the food chain. If the consumption of meat diminished we would not have to cut down parts of the rainforests to find more arable ground. Even though all people wouldn't turn vegetarians, everybody (including the animals) would gain if we did not eat as much meat as we do. This is not the time for only thinking about our own welfare and pleasure as most people seem to think that meat is a part of. We are not alone on this planet. Finally; animals are suffering, people are starving, inhabitants in the high-meat-consuming west world are growing fatter and becoming sicker. Even though there are a lot more to say on this topic I think these are arguments strong enough to stop or at least reduce our consumption of meat. They are enough for me. Are they enough for you?$$$﻿ Legal age for buying alcohol should be 18 At the age of eighteen you are permitted by law in Sweden to drive a car, to vote and to take a loan at the bank. You are also legally responsible of your own actions, even allowed to get married, but you are not permitted to buy champagne to your own wedding. How can a person, who probably made the biggest decision in his or her life to love someone until death, not be old enough to have a glass of wine with some friends a Saturday evening? And how can it be that a country like Sweden treats a person as an adult from the age of eighteen on all areas except giving the freedom to buy alcohol? The law says that when you are eighteen you have reached a reasonable ripeness of judgement to handle the demands, which are connected to these. Obviously buying alcohol is not one of them. I disagree and state that buying and drinking alcohol should be legal at the same age. 1467 was the year when alcohol first came to Sweden. It was suppose to be one of the ingredients in the gunpowder production. In the beginning of 1900th century, alcohol was cheap and selling it was free. Never earlier or later have people been drinking so much as then. Men who had a physical hard job could get a part of the salary paid in alcohol. This entered into more drinking and injuries and less work. From 1917 the government controlled all import, export, buying and selling. The limited age for buying alcohol changed from 21 to 20 1969. I do not believe that alcohol is good for the health or that alcoholism should be more acceptable. I know that there is a connection between an early debut in drinking and alcoholism even though in many cases it is something already in your genes, but I will argue against the laws we have in Sweden. I think it is wrong to separate drinking and buying. It gives it a double meaning, which can very easily be confused. The Swedish legal system is unique when it comes to the laws about alcohol. Swedish drinking habits differs from many other countries in Europe. We do not drink every day, instead we drink a lot in the weekends. If we would hear about someone who drank daily we would all think he or she is an alcoholic. In France for instance it is a part of their culture to drink wine to the evening meal and drinking is seen as social thing and not as a dangerous threat to the young. In the States it is legal to drink at 21 but instead they face even bigger problems such as drugs. If we look at alcohol as a poison, something that is bad for your health and consequently made the laws based on that, smoking is just as damaging to you and to others and should also be treated with the same respect. The problem we face today, even though we have laws that do not permit buying alcohol under the age of 20, is that the alcohol consumption is higher then ever among youths and it is going even further down in age. Of all alcohol that the Swedish people drink 35% is privately distilled. It is not because it taste better, or because it has a higher percentage of alcohol that people drink it, but it is easy to get and a lot less expensive. Selling homebrewed liquor to teenagers should be followed by an unmerciful punishment, because for people under age this is usually their way to get liquor. If the legal age for buying alcohol was 18 and Systembolaget had complete monopoly, it would be under controlled forms and privately distilled would not be that attractive. Alcohol creates alcoholism I defiantly agree on that, but it is not the access on liquor that makes alcoholism. Alcoholism is in many cases something that is in your genes, like a congenital desire. Alcohol is more about culture and what we learn when we grow up. The majority of the population never becomes alcoholics therefore shall we not treat young adults as if they have not reached the level of awareness of the dangerous aspects in drinking. From the age of eighteen you are seen as an adult and should be able to make and take responsible decisions such as buying and drinking alcohol.
EE557	0	﻿ The West is responsible for environmental damage in developing countries The state of the environment is a hotly debated topic and a part of this discussion is if the West is responsible for the environmental damage of the world that takes place in the developing countries. People who claim that the West got nothing to do with the destruction in these parts of the world forget to take into consideration that the key factors of their destruction are demands and economical pressure from the West. As to make up one's mind about this you also have to take in to account that these countries have not got the same knowledge as the West. It is often suggested by the media that the West is not responsible for the environmental damage that is taking place in the developing countries. Some people would argue that the fact that rainforests are being destroyed in Brazil is their responsibility not ours. The real situation is more complex. They cut down the rainforests on the strengths of demands from the West. We need material to be able to produce all gadgets and unnecessary stuff that we have in our society. The fact that we today have a threatening number of endangered species is a result of human beings will to own as much as possible. It is obvious that poaching would not exist to the same extent if people from the West did not buy coats, ivory etc. Destruction in these parts of the world is a direct consequence of demands from people in the West. A major reason for destruction in developing countries is that many of them owe money to western banks. They need economic growth, whatever its environmental consequences, to pay back on these loans. Another example of economical reasons that makes the West responsible for the damage caused in the developing countries is that the West sell second-hand products to the developing countries. Boats, aeroplanes and things like that. And what happens when these enormous metal products are impossible to use any longer. Well the developing countries have not got resources to take care of it so they just leave them to rust. Is that not the responsibility of the West? Demands in society today have gone totally out of control and the major cause of it is avarice. Many western companies make a mint by selling products which have run out of date in developing countries. They would be sued if they tried to sell these products in a western country so to make earn as much as possible they just send them to a developing country. In Thailand provisions that had best before use date one year ago can be seen in the stores. There are also cosmetic products that had run out of date with as much as four years. As to make up one's mind about who to blame about the damage of the world in developing countries we have to take into account that there is a lack of knowledge in these countries. The problem is that they are not aware of what actually happens when we tamper with the environment. The West, on the other hand, know for example that the greenhouse effect is expected to lead to changes in climate with more frequent floods, droughts and heat waves. For example an urgent environmental concern like endangered species needs us in the West to educate people in developing countries otherwise it will result in consequences like extinction. Owing to the fact that we have this kind of knowledge we are definitely as responsible as they are, or even more, for the destruction that takes place in developing countries. To sum up, people who argue that the West is not responsible for the damages in developing countries are far too narrow-minded. It is clear that the destruction depend as much on our demands and pressure as on their misbehaviour. We should show less self-interest and educate them instead. According to what has been taken up in this essay it is quite wrong to suggest that the West is not responsible for environmental damage in developing countries, on the contrary, the West is the cause of it. On the whole everyone is responsible for protecting the environment, even you and I.$$$﻿ A modern monarchy Sweden has been a monarchy for a very long time. In fact, our history is to a large extent connected with the different kings and queens that have ruled the country. Even though the boundaries have changed several times due to wars, conflicts and unions our monarchy has persevered. The role of the monarch has however seen a huge transformation over the last two hundred years and the powers of Gustav II Adolf or Karl XII cannot be compared with those of the present king Carl XIV Gustav. The parliament is today the main legislative and ruling body with the government being the second with the Supreme Court being separated from political influence. It does not deal with political matters or interfere with the laws passed by the parliament. The powers listed above all belonged to the monarch a little longer than two hundred years ago. The king or queen was the lawmaker, commander of the armed forces and the main ruler of the nation. Swedish kings are famous of their warfare with neighbouring counties and battles throughout northern Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, however, the situation is completely different today where the monarch's powers have been reduced to none as a consequence of the parliamentary movements of the 19th century. In 1809, the first reform took place when dissatisfied generals set the king aside and the monarch's powers were reduced and shared with different ruling bodies. Fifty years later a reform was passed that changed the foundation of the class-based parliament to a parliament based on income and property. The monarch's power was not changed dramatically during these years but a process had started that would eventually relieve the monarch of his former duties. The new form of government had come to grow strong and it was now the parliament that became the new ruling body in domestic and international matters. As the parliament took over the responsibility of ruling the country it was expected of the monarch to stay neutral and not to express himself in political matters. Despite this fact king Gustav V chose in 1914 not to agree with the existing prime minister, as a result of this controversy the prime minister resigned. Since then there have been no further utterances in political matters form the monarch and we expect the him to keep a low profile, even in non-political matters even though it is claimed by some people that the present king and queen are strong leaders of opinion in different matters such as hunting and child-pornography. The king and queen of Sweden are today merely representatives of the country who appear on official state visits and also travel around the world creating good relations with other countries and putting Sweden on the map. There is no power at all to talk about and the monarch simply receives a salary that will enable him to carry out his duties as a representative of our country. The opposition, the critics of the monarchy, claim that it is old-fashioned and not equivalent with the modern society and also that it is expensive for the taxpayers. I don't find this sort of criticism very well considered. Firstly, Sweden is a very old country and the monarchy is a big part of our history as well as our identity. I think it is quite unique living in a country where we still have a monarchy because there are not many countries that are monarchies today. When it comes to the question of democracy and the modern day society the monarch does not have any political power as seen above, all those powers have been taken away from the monarch and been put in the hands of the people. This fact shows henceforth that a monarchy really can exist within the boundaries of a modern democracy. Secondly, the argument saying that it is expensive to uphold and support the royal family's living expenses does not seem to hold ground. Compared to other expenses it is a very small fraction of the tax money that is paid. Repairing or rebuilding the monarch's residences would add up to a big sum of money up front but it is hardly noticeable in the big economy and besides we pay so much taxes in this country that you would not be able to see the difference. Thirdly, and as a final thought, if we were to abolish the monarchy in Sweden, what would the tabloids write about?
EE093	1	﻿ Is English a Germanic or a Romance Language? 1. There are people like Jean-Marc Gachelin, the Professor of English at the University of Rouen, asking whether English is a Romance language or not, while "English behaves like a Romance language", according to the article "Is English a Romance language", English Today, July 23, 1990. Anyhow, researches as, (Barber,1993 and Baugh & Cable,1993) have accounted clearly that English is a Germanic language. 2. If you want to describe a language completely you need to analyse its morphology, phonology and its syntax. The aim of this essay is to give a picture of the English vocabular, by means of 200 lexical words found in the article "Eyes on the Eclipse", NEWSWEEK, August 1999, and to analyse the origin of the words. Consequently, the article from NEWSWEEK is the primary source of the investigation. The secondary sources are research made by C Barber, A Baugh & T Cable and J Williams. The secondary sources are used to picture up a background in receiving a description of the grammatical structure of the English language 3. Initially it is useful to narrate the development of the English language and to consider about all the influences that the language has passed through. Secondly follows a description of structures of the English language. As the last part of the investigation the analysis of the origin of the lexical words is reported. Finally follows the conclusion about the origin of the English language. Some abbreviations are used such as: F= French ME= Middle English OE= Old English ON= Old Norse IE= Indo-European MHG= Middle High German OF= Old French OS= Old Saxon L= Latin OC= Old Celtic OFris= Old Frisian PIE= Proto-Indo-European Du= Middle Dutch O Dutch= Old Dutch OHG= Old High German T= Teutonic 4. The English language is an Indo-European language, (IE), like Latin, (L), and French, (F). They have developed out of the Proto-Indo-European, (PIE), language that was spoken thousands of years ago, (Barber, 1993). The PIE expanded from their homeland, some research-worker say eastern Anatolia, (Turkey), and ended up in Iran, India and most parts of Europe 7 000 BC or later. The first people in England about whose language we have definite knowledge are the Celts, (Baugh & Cable, 1993). The Celts came from central Europe about 400 BC. Their language derives subsequently from the PIE language. During the Roman invasion AD 43 to 449 AD Latin was used among military and official classes in England but it was not widespread. Latin did not replace the Celtic language. 5. The Germanic Conquest in 449 AD conveyed that settlers migrated from the Danish peninsula and the area Schleswig-Holstein, (Angles and probably Jutes). The Saxons came from the area between the Elbe and the Ems and probably as far as the Rhine, (Baugh & Cable, 1993). They also believe that the Frisians, inhabitants of a narrow string along the coast from the Weser to the Rhine came to England about the same time. The language of the new settlers was Germanic, derived out of the PIE language. The Anglo-Saxons became founders of the English nation. Their Germanic language remanied the dominant one. The Celtic language decreased in importance. The language of England changed to what we call Old English, with a huge vocabulary and high inflected words. 6. Scandinavian Vikings invaded England between 750 AD and 1050 AD. The Vikings were mostly Danes but some of them were from Norway, (Barber, 1993). Their language was also Germanic, north Germanic. The Scandinavians left 1 000 words which were adapted as loan words in the English language, (Williams, 1975). The Norman Conquest in 1066 brought French into England as the language of the higher classes and much of the Old English vocabulary appropriate to literature and learning died out and was replaced later by words borrowed from French and Latin, (Barber,1993). At about 1100 AD the Old English language changed to Middle English. The Normans did not learn the English language, but French did not remain as the dominant one in England because the Normans did not speak Parisian French which was the standard. The Hundred Years War and the Black Death helped the English language to survive. French was officially abandoned in law-courts in 1362, (Williams, 1975). 7. All these invasions of different groups of people had influence on the English language. English has since the Anglo-Saxons been a Germanic language and still is. The PG language had inherited strong verbs from the PIE language which showed change of tense by changing the vowel of their stem. Alongside these strong verbs the PG invented a new type of verbs called the weak ones, (Baugh & Cable,1993). Sometime between 1 000- 500 BC a great consonant change took place, called Grimm's law or the First Sound Shifting, when bh, dh, gh became voiced b,d,g and those voiced consonants became voiceless p, t k. The voice-less consonants changed to the fricatives f, 0, h. Verner's law is another change in the PG language. It changed the predominantly pitch accent to predominantly stress accent, i.e. the fixing of the accent on the first syllable of the word. The PIE had free accent such as Greek still has, (Barber,1993). A third change in PG was Ablaut/Gradation which implied a change of vowels in related forms, especially the strong verbs for instance sing, sang, sung was i OE singan, sang, sungon derived out of the PG change seng, song, sng. PG developed into two tenses, the present and the past. It got even e-grade in the past tense, o-grade in the past singular and zero-grade in the past plural and past participle. A simplification of the inflectional system of the weak declension of the adjective took place, but it did not survive in Modern English and was replaced by the use of auxaillaires 8. In Old English as in most of the German languages the Umlaut/Front/I-mutation took place. The PG diphthongs were changed in some front vowels in major parts of England, i,i or j disappeared or changed to e, fronting of back vowels before i/j and short a, ae, o changed to e, (Barber, 1993). The definite article and the adjective played a large part in the old English marking out distinctions of case and number. The loss of this function by the end of the Middle English period, 1500 A D, implied a major change in the structure of the language. Grammatical gender disappeared and was replaced by natural gender. Word order became important, S-V-O became the dominant one during the Middle English period. Middle English is often referred to as the period of weakened inflections while many endings became identical, (Barber, 1993). 9. By the decay of the inflectional system was the use of separate words to perform the functions formerly carried out by word-endings. Prepositions as in, with, by became more frequently used than in Old English. The English language developed from a synthetic language to an analythic language, called Modern English about 1500 AD. An analythic language uses very few bound morphemes such as prefixes, suffixes and inflections in nouns and verbs. Weak verbs became the dominant verb-forms in Germanic languages. Many strong verbs have changed over to weak ones. The Latin noun has six different cases with separate inflections for the singular and the plural. The PIE language had eight, English has only two. As has been told earlier the Romance languages, Latin and French, have inflected the English language, but even the Germanic people have. Let us have a look at that matter. <table removed> 14. According to the analysis of the 200 lexical words it is clear that 108 of them have Romance origin, the adverbs mostly. The Romans and the Normans influenced the English language with 10 000 words which were adapted in the English language as loan words, (Baugh & Cable,1993). The Romance influence of the English vocabulary implied that the English language was supplied with a number of educated words. Due to what is earlier described about the English language and its grammarian structure English is a Germanic language, with stress on the first syllables. Finally it must be obvious to any one that the English language is a Germanic language although history has had flux on the language it still remains a Germanic language with the characterizations: a simplified inflectional system inherited from the PG, the development of a increasing amount of weak verbs and the change from predominantly pitch accent to predominantly stress accent. The English language has become an analythic language. References. Barber Charles. 1993. The English language.

The NEW AGE movement has become very popular in Sweden, during the 90s. Even trade and industry have interests in what the supporters of NEW AGE call "universal" old wisdom. Background. Any interested person can find the roots of the NEW AGE movement in nature religion and oriental tradition, according to Bra Bockers Lexikon, 1988. The explorer(ess) Helena Blavatsky established in the end of the 19 th century the Theosophy during a period when the Romanticism, with exotic strains and mysticism were prevalent. The Theosophy is a utopian, religious comprehensive faith with strains of esoteric Gnosticism, Buddhism and Hinduism. The Theosophy defines, according to Bra Bockers Lexikon, conceptions which are essential in today's NEW AGE movement: reincarnation, karma, aura, and the ego. Gabriella Ahlstrom writes in "NEW AGE Vetenskap eller bluff?", Akademiker 3-1999, that there arose two breakaway groups from the Theosophy in the 30s. It was the anthroposophy led by Rudolf Steiner and the Arcane school established by Alice Bailey. Bailey was the first person who talked about NEW AGE. After the Second World War the activities of the NEW AGE movement decreased. Science and technical progress were the most important items in society, according to Ahlstrom. On the other hand were peoples' interest in the 50s in California, USA, growing towards: Buddhism, gurus and human psychology. The NEW AGE movement caught the hippies' attention in the 60s. The hippies were seekers. They were interested in astrology, Zen Buddhism, tarot, mediums and alternative medicine. The NEW AGE movement reached Sweden in the beginning of the 70s and its signification has increased during the 90s. The NEW AGE movement is today more popular than ever. The central items in the NEW AGE movement are the personal experiences and emotions. Your feelings are always right. Likewise, another characterization of the NEW AGE is the item of spiritual guidance. The NEW AGE movement is not occupied with evil. According to Ahlstrom there is no devil or hell, there are only positive or negative vibrations. Mainly, women are supporters of the NEW AGE movement. NEW AGE in Our Workplaces. Trade and industry have, according to Ahlstrom, adopted the ideas of the NEW AGE movement about positively thinking. Your thoughts have influence on your life. Many employer proffer their staff courses which are developing personality. The Swedish banker Jacob Wallenberg says in Ahlstrom's article that his company proffers their staff a kind of "mentally training", something that already has been practising in the athletics. It can for instance be to walk on glowing coal, to split plank with help of mental energy, or to listen at an astrologer or to a witch. Trade and industry are interested in good leadership. They want to develop the individual ability to lead. Consequently, they see a connection between development in spiritual life and professional economic development. Ahlstrom writes further that Telia proffers their leaders retreat courses in Vadstena because they want to give them the opportunity to experience silence and communication among fundamental matters in life. The courses are arranged in beautiful surroundings where the staff has the opportunity to meditate and talk about ethics and philosophy of life. In Ahlstrom's article Wallenberg says that we all need a connection between body and soul. It is important with emotions in trade and industry. He also says that it is possible to strengthen individuals from the inside. Once upon a time NEW AGE was looked upon as a subculture. Nowadays it is better to call it a mass culture. From Subculture to High culture. Why are the banking and other profitable companies in Sweden interested in staking money and energy on lectures by witches or to let company leaders split plank with help of mental energy? Several factors, I believe, can be important when you try to get an answer to the question. However, there are, in my opinion, two main important items; -the companies want to strengthen the individuals from the inside. When your employer stakes energy on your personality it hopefully will make yourself do the uttermost back. -the companies want the staffs' thinking to be positive. Positive vibrations are good because they make all individuals efficient. The more efficient you are the better your concentration is on your work. We have during the 90s in Sweden acquired acquaintance with crises of economy. We have also heard a lot about fusion of companies. It seems as if we have harder times economically. We have nowadays a stiff competition and only the strongest survives. Whether your company is competitive or not depends sometimes on the human factor. Anyway you could say that if NEW AGE is good for General Motors it is good for mankind.
EE491	1	﻿ "Why spoil a good mother to make an ordinary grammarian?" In this essay I'm going to describe the attitudes towards education for women in nineteenth-century Britain. During this period there was an enormous debate going on, if girls should receive any education at all and; if they did, what they ought to study and if it should be the same kind of education as for boys. Before the industrialisation, men and women more or less shared all work. But when machines took over, much of what the women used to do was no longer needed, and because of that, their education seemed even more unnecessary. But during the nineteenth century the debate started, as more and more women felt the need for education. Most girls received very little education, and what they learned was mostly what they would need as future wives and mothers. The main argument against female education was that women didn't work, and so didn't need to learn much more than what they could learn at home. School for girls was considered a waste of time, since they would never be working outside of their home. Mrs Sarah Ellis says in her book "The women of England", that what girls learned at school did not prepare them for their future life. At school they tried to be better then everybody else, and later in life they would have to make place for others and make others happy. There were some schools for girls, but what they learned there were things like dancing, conversation and playing the piano. They also learned reading and maybe some French, which according to Sarah Ellis, was a waste of time, since they would never speak anything but their mother-tongue. Social skills were more important for girls than intellectual ones, and for families who couldn't afford to send all their children to school, let their daughters stay home. Those who were against female education also had medical arguments. They said that the differences between men and women were innate and because of that it wasn't possible for them to learn the same things. Women were inferior to men both physically and mentally, and these were facts that one should not attempt to change. When they looked at "primitive" civilisations, where men and women were more equal, they saw this as a proof that the European had gone further in their development, that these "primitive" peoples had not yet reached this state in evolution, where the differences between the sexes started to show. Women themselves agreed to this. Several women have actually written that they know that are inferior to men. Sarah Ellis writes: "I know that woman is naturally and necessarily weak in comparison to man;" and Elizabeth Barrett has the same opinion: "There is a natural inferiority of mind in women". They do not try to argue against this, to them it is just the way it is, even the way it should be, and there is no way to change it. This was proved by the fact that although there were women who wrote books and painted, all great writers and artists throughout history had been men. Women were also more intuitive than men, they didn't think logically, but used their intuition, which made men superior, since they had the possibility of thinking more clearly. Since men and women didn't think the same way, there was no pint for boys and girls to study the same things. Scientists were sure that women's inferiority was a cause of their brains being smaller than men's. This was a proof that men had gone further in evolution. Children's heads were smaller, and because of this, they were less intelligent. There were of course also arguments for education for women. First of all, a well-educated mother could more easily motivate her sons to study, and provide a good environment for that. Secondly, many people thought that since women were intellectually inferior to men, they were also more easily diverted from what they were doing. They put too much emotion into their actions and their thinking, and this caused men to worry too much about them. Because of this they should be educated in a way that put them on "the right path", otherwise they would "fall prey to the temptations towards which their nature led them" (Burstyn, p 70.) Sarah Ellis says that girls are able to do almost everything their brothers do, for example, they need physical exercise just like boys, and are able to do almost the same things, although they should be protected from activities where they could get hurt. She also says it is possible for girls to study subjects having to do with nature such as botany, since they have the same ability as boys to "admire the beautiful". But the ideal way of educating girls was to do it at home, since that was where they would spend their lives. The way I understand the material that I have read, there doesn't seem to have been very many people in nineteenth-century Britain who thought girls shouldn't receive any education at all. But what they thought was that that boys and girls were different and that it would be unnatural to give them the same kind of education. It was even impossible to do this, since boys and girls didn't think the same way, their minds worked differently and there was no way for a girl to take in the same amount of knowledge as a boy, since her brain was smaller than his. A woman was supposed to take care of home and children and be a good wife and mother. All she needed to know she could learn without leaving home. Nobody seems to have thought women were really less intelligent than men, only that the male brain was further developed and because of that men had greater possibilities of learning.$$$﻿ Corridor or apartment, which is best? In May last year I moved into a student-corridor in Flogsta here in Uppsala after having lived in an apartment for about four months. It was quite a big apartment and I had shared it with a friend. I was used to having a big kitchen and a big living-room for just the two of us, and the possibility to invite lots of friends. Living in a corridor meant big changes for me. I would have to share kitchen and living-room with eleven people I didn't know from the beginning. If I was unlucky I would get neighbours who stole my food from the refrigerator or used my kitchen-tools. Now I've lived there for almost a year, and ny now I know that I actually prefer to live like this. It suits me perfectly, at least for the moment I would not like to go back to living in an apartment, and now I'm going to tell you why. If you live in a corridor with people you like, it's almost like getting a new, big family. There is always someone to talk to, if you're feeling lonely you can just go to the kitchen and if there's nobody there right at the moment, they will soon come. And if you feel that you want to be alone, you can go to your room and close the door. You have a choice that you wouldn't have if you lived alone in an apartment. I know I wouldn't be able to live in an apartment of my own right now. I would just sit staring out the window and feel lonely and miserable. But in the corridor I've always got some members of my "family" who wants to talk to me. Of course, I would probably study more if I wasn't tempted to spend so much time in the kitchen, but onthe other hand, if I felt sad and lonely I wouldn't get that much done either. What could be a problem, though, is that the people with whom you live know everything about you. They know when you leave and when you come home, and if you come home alone. There is much gossip in a place like that. I think veerybody ought to try living this way at some time in their lives. You learn a lot about how to get along with other people. For me, this is especielly important, since I'm an only child and 'm not used to having to compromise with brothers and sisters all the time. Now I learn to take my responsibility in another way, for example, I have to clena the kitchen every time I've used it, I can't just leave my dirty plate in the sink, because I know how irritating it is when the others do that. If I lived by myself, I wouldn't care that much, because it would only be my own dirty kitchen and nobody would tell me to clean up. Another thing you learn is of course to share things, and that makes it even more important to wash the dirty saucepans and plates, since someone else will want to use them. The way I see it, this kind of living is very good. I've already mentioned the main arguments, but there are of course others as well. If you forget to buy something there is always somebody in the corridor from whom you can borrow it. Or if you are ill and can't get out of bed, the others can take care of you and go shopping for you. If you live by yourself there is a risk that you can't get anything to eat for days if you're too ill to go out. I feel that I know quite well what I'm talking about when I say that everybody should live with other people like this for a period in their lives, because I've lived both in a corridor and in a shared apartment, and, before that, all by myself in a very small room when I studied in Paris. I don't think I can find a better way of living at this period in my life. I know that I need to be close to other people, or I would be depressed and lonely. I've learned a lot
EE061	0	﻿ Time for a law against Tobacco One of the most powerful methods of getting rid of dangerous threats to society, is to make laws for protective purposes. For instance, we have laws to make traffic safer, and we have laws that forbids ordinary people from carrying guns. We also have laws that makes a clear statement regarding narcotics. And yet we have no law protecting us from the most popular, and therefore perhaps the most dangerous drug of them all, and that is of course tobacco. There can be little doubt, that a law that makes the sale and use of every form of tobacco illegal, is of the utmost importance. It is a well known fact that tobacco is hazardous to people's health. But there is not only the commonly known riscs of cancer and severe heart conditions that should cause worry. I once saw a list of the damage that tobacco may inflict upon a human body. At least a hundred deceases were listed, and almost every part of the body was mentioned. Furthermore this list showed that tobacco is not only causing physical illness. A person might also get various psychical disfunctions from using tobacco, such as sleeping problems and depression to mention a few. Needless to say perhaps, the healthproblems that comes from tobacco, are not of the kind that can be cured overnight. Every year more people die from deceases directly related to using tobacco, than from anything else. And before they die these thousands of people suffering from tobaccorelatd deseases occupies already overcrowded hospitals, making it not only a healthissue, but a financial matter, as well. There is of course a considerable amount of taxmoney to be saved here. At the present, we have an ongoing debate over the shortage of healthcare money, and still we allow a great deal of that money to be eaten up by costs caused by tobacco. This gives us an equation that is easy enough to solve. With a law against tobacco there would be no such expense. And we all know that the money is well needed elsewhere in a country's healthcare system. We also have endless expensive goverment campaigns advicing us not to use tobacco. Again money that could be easily saved simply by a law prohibiting tobacco. There are people arguing that the state actually have a taxincom on tobacco. Such arguments are of course complete and utter nonsense. The money the state gain on taxes from the sale of tobacco may be the equivalent of a mere few percent of what the tobacco is costing in healthcare. Finally I would like to emphazise on the thought of our forthcoming generations, and their growth in a society were a drug like tobacco, that really has no purpose apart from being a danger to their health, still has not been made illegal. A common answer to the question, why a person is using tobacco, is simply that the person for some reason once tried it and from that day is unable to stop. That only shows that by passing a law that bans tobacco, we can take away the possibility of that fatal first try to be exposed to our children. Every day passing is another day, where thousands of young people take up "the bad habit". And every such day should be considered a failure on our part, in terms of showing proper respect to the next generation. The next generation deserves this law. Arguments concerning health and finance clearly says that we should have one. So let us not hesitate any longer. Let us in the name of common sense, by law state that we have understood the folishness of allowing tobacco. Let us show the responsibility one has the right to expect from a civilized society. It is, and has been ever since tobacco was first tried by man, time to pass the law that bans tobacco.$$$﻿In this essay I am going to write about my relation to the English language. I will try to assess my strengths and weaknesses in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. I say try, because this is the first written exercise out of four I have to perform during this course in English. Right now this task feels insuperable but I will try my best. I will start with listening to English. I think listening is the easiest part for me out of the four skills mentioned above. If there is something I don't understand I ask if possible or look it up in a dictionary. I don't think it is difficult to grasp the connection while I am listening to English. I probably have some weakness in this area but I can't think of any right now. When it comes to reading I have to say that I don't have so much experience from that for the last ten years or so. I am thirty-four years old so it has been a while since I went to school and besides reading a few novels I haven't read anything in English since then. My strength in reading is that I really like to read especially novels. The only thing is that I usually read these books written in Swedish and now I have to read them in English instead. I don't mind, I actually enjoy it! My weakness in reading is my lack of understanding some words and I do hope my vocabulary will increase during this semester. y skills in speaking English are not very good, but perhaps normal for a native-born Swedish with no experience of living in another country. I have been to England twice on vacation but really, how much English do you speak while you're visiting Big Ben, Madame Tussaud's and The Tower?! And we shouldn't talk about visiting The White Hart Lane to look at Tottenham Hotspurs Vs Coventry City, because there you just need body language and a good singing voice. The most difficult thing about speaking English is that it's sometimes hard to find the right words and the words often seems to stumble on my tongue. I guess a lot of practise would make it better. In my job as a post-office clerk it sometimes happens that I have a chance to speak English, both with tourists and immigrants which haven't learnt Swedish yet. I really enjoy these moments despite all my lacks, because I think it's funny to speak English and I want to learn more. About my skills in writing in English I am sorry to say that it's bad. I have none experience what so ever since senior high school. The grammar test I did on the first day of this semester didn't go so well, especially the translation part was difficult. I guess this is the part, which I have to make an effort and work hard with. During the former semester, while I was studying Swedish, I discovered a lot of new skills in my own writing. It was gratifying to see the progress I made in my writing during the course and it became more fun to write. I hope this course will turn out the same way. The first test was this assignment and the biggest problem was to get enough words in the text. In conclusion I would like to say that perhaps I don't have so many strengths in my English skills but I am very determined that I can go through whit this course, even if it's going to cost "blood, sweat and tears" and of course a lot of hard work. If that is the price, I'm going to pay it!
EE066	0	﻿Since I started studying English in the fourth grade, back in 1965, I have always felt that English was an easy language to learn, and therefore I felt pretty competent throughout my school years. I don't believe I'm over-confident about my abilities, since I always got the highest grade in English. As every non-native speaker of a foreign language I have my weaknesses (and hopefully strengths as well), although this is the first time I ever thought about them. When dividing my knowledge of the language into the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing, the assessment will be quite different in all of these areas. Starting with listening, I feel comfortable that I will understand, not everything, but usually the main parts of what is said in a conversation with an English speaking person. It is of course easier in a person-to-person situation, when you can ask for clarification of certain unfamiliar words, than when you listen to the radio or watch TV. Then there is no one to ask and no time to consult a dictionary. Recently I have started to watch Euro News more frequently in order to get more training in listening and understanding. I also feel capable of spotting the mistakes in translation from English to Swedish that often appears in films and TV shows. There is always room for improvement, and I would certainly need a larger vocabulary. In my opinion, the best way to achieve that vocabulary is to read a lot, and make use of the dictionary. When I read novels I find more words I've never heard before, than when I listen to English. Novelists tend to use more unusual words in their writing, than we normally do in speaking. My biggest problem in this field is that I forget the new words the first two or three times I look them up, so I have to rub them in. Generally, I seem to understand the content in written English fairly good, but need to develope more speed and fluency in my reading. y pronounciation, when I speak English is rather satisfactory, in my own opinion anyway. A problem for me is that I sometimes mix British and American pronounciation. My guess is that it depends on in which of the two accents I first heard a new word, or perhaps who I am talking to. I try to stick to the British way of pronounciation as much as possible, though. I felt a bit rusty in speaking and pronounciating when arriving at the Department of English, since it's been a rather long while since I used my English orally, but my confidence is building nicely and it feels like it's getting better every day. I find that the most difficult part in any foreign language is to write correctly and with any fluency, and this applies of course to my writing in English as well. This is probably due to the fact that we never had any, or very little, writing training in school. Swedish schools tend to focus on the spoken language. This is actually the first time I ever tried to write something coherent in English, and I am afraid a lot of mistakes may appear. One area which affects all of the above mentioned skills is my rather poor knowledge of grammatical rules. I think I have a gut feeling that helps me to choose the correct expressions in talking and writing, but without the real know-how I can never be quite sure. The only thing I can remember from grammar lessons in school was learning the different forms of the irregular verbs. We had about five verbs each week as homework. I guess we must have done other areas as well, but my memory in quite blank here. I see now that a theoretical understanding of the language is important, and the main reason I have choosen English in my teachers education is to learn these elements. Naturally, my aim is to get better in all different aspects of English as well as through the didactics learn how to teach English to the next generation of young Swedish pupils. I'm pleased to say that I've already found out that writing more in school is essential, and we have not yet had a single didactic lesson.$$$﻿English is one of the major languages, widely spoken by many in today's sociaty, actually in all over the world. I don't believe there has been anyone that somehow hasn't been exposed to the English language, either from watching TV, reading magazines or simply by listening to music. However, the actual knowledge and confidence of using the language is much different from person to person, no matter how much they have learnt at school or practiced it. This short essay will be about me and what I believe my weaknesses and strengths are, toward the English language in the following four skills: listening, reading, speaking and writing, in comparision with each one of them. First skill I will discuss is listening. Listening is farmore, one of my better skills compared to the other three. I have, from young age, been exposed and dealt with many different people and cultures as my family has acquiantances from a wide range of different nationalities. Also from being in Asia, working for more than 7 years, I have gained much knowledge and experience in the differences of speech and pronounciations of the language. It happens, that when talking to people with a different dialect or pronounciation, I was the only one who actually understood the whole conversation. Difficult and different English pronounciation is specially common among people from Thailand, India and Japan. I have also, as many thousand others, been an exchange student in the USA. This was where I initally was exposed to the the English language, and needed to use it on a daily bases. It is very valuable when dealing with native speakers. You learn things you normally cannot be taught in school, such as, understanding the different tone and emphasis on different words or phrases and also simply to be able to feel and taste the languange itself. y second skill I will bring up is reading. I read somewhat extensively. Unfortunatly, mostly magazines and litterature that is less litterary such as fictions and autobiographies. Many times, reading improves your understanding and meaning of a word. This is because you see the unfamiliar word in a phrase or a sentence in a situation or text you already understand or know. After finding the word in the dictionary, I somehow always seem to forget them so when it comes time or situation to use them, the word is usually at the 'tip of the tongue' since you remember the meaning of the word by remember the text or article you last saw it but you just cannot recall the word for it. Is there a way of improving your memory, otherwise learning new words would be meaningless for me. The third skill is speaking. I dont believe I have much difficulties in speaking since oral communication has been a daily approach for me while working only with foreigners for many years. However, I believe speaking in front of groups, is a major problem. I can be well prepared with my presentation or speech but I get very nervous and say things (or don't say) things I should say and fumble or stammer my whole presentation. Although, I speak quite fluent, or I should say, I am fully capable of expressing what I want or feel, I find my language and vocabulary very 'simple'. I, not only need to expand my word vocabulary but also find ways of being able to recall and use them when situation occurs. And my forth and last point will be about writing. Unfortunatly writing is my weakest point. Maybe because I never was a creative person in terms of essay or story writing. I disliked all forms of writing and whenever courses in writing was offered I tend not to choose these. Therefore basic knowledge such as setting up texts correctly, how each sets of paragraphs should be written, the proceedeure of the text content etc. is very poor. But how important is writing skills? Nowadays, many companies have their own formats for writing ex memos, quotations or different kind of reports so in actual work I believe writing is making less importance unless professions such as journalist or critics etc. Conclusion is, out of the four skills in English language, listening skill is my major strength whereas writing skills is my major weakness. By participating in this course I hope to be able to firstly, improve my written English and grammar but also to expand my general knowledge towards the English language in all aspects.
EE069	1	﻿ Television- good or bad? There are not many homes in the industrialised world that do not include at least one television set. You often hear people comment that they would be much better off without television or that they are addicted to it. Some people feel it is a very important medium to receive information and to get new ideas while others believe it is detrimental to your health. Reflecting on these issues, you realise that there are both positive and negative effects from watching television. Television as a means to provide people with information can be seen as both positive and negative. I think most people would agree that information in the form of news and documentaries are important and educating. When we are enlightened about what goes on in the world and in our own country we can also act for or against these things in one way or another to make a difference. However, we cannot really know weather what we see and hear is true or not. I am convinced that some of the information we receive has been twisted for us to sympathise with one side or another. Now that computer animation has become very advanced we face the danger of being totally deceived. There are already techniques to make video clips of people that were actually never filmed. Photos of a person can be animated to make that person look like he or she is speaking and moving. For entertainment and even educational purposes these techniques can probably be useful. Information tends to be more interesting and stick better in our minds when several senses are stimulated at the same time. Pictures, text and sounds on the television screen can help us create a positive atmosphere for learning. If we are to use television both for entertainment and educational purposes we need to look at the health aspects of doing so. Too much time spent in front of the television is damaging to our health in many respects. Just sitting down watching makes us both passive and physically unfit and I sincerely believe that the multitude of images in very short sequences will shorten our attention spans in the long run. We get used to everything happening really fast and outside in the "real world" it is not always like that. Besides, there is a risk that watching too much television will make people neglect, voluntarily or not, other important work that has to be done and some even use television to repress a problem instead of dealing with it, which I would call very unhealthy. On the contrary, comedy shows in a moderate amount can have a positive effect since laughter is said to prolong your life. Apart from comedy shows there are other programmes to enjoy, programmes that affect your creativity. Travelling, cooking and home decorating tips shown on television can work as a good source of inspiration and challenge you to try new and creative ideas. Often these things seem very simple on the screen while they take some practise in real life, but once you get started you may develop a new creative hobby. Unfortunately, I believe that most people who watch these shows do not actually use the ideas they get from them. Creativity in general probably diminishes because you choose to watch rather than do. How many people do not end up in front of the television after dinner when having guests instead of socialising? However when you choose to socialise with family or friends, you can always use programmes as foundation for discussions and such discussions may impact your creativity in a positive way. From personal experience and from what I hear people say, television is abused and takes up too much of our time. There are many negative effects but in moderate doses, and if you choose carefully what you watch, television can be very useful.$$$﻿ Should the family look after the elderly? It has been proposed that the family, and not the state, should look after the elderly. It seems like a natural thing to do when you first think about it. The children would grow up with their grandparents nearby and perhaps the understanding between old people and youths would improve. However, the society we live in today can not really be called natural and such heroic deeds do no longer fit in with people's lifestyles. It sounds to me just like a way for the state to save money and place a lot of extra work on the already overworked people and therefor I'm against it. The main reason why I don't agree with the proposition is that people in today's society have enough problems to worry about. Many men and women already feel overloaded with work, which includes both of them managing a full-time job, taking care of a home, a relationship and possibly of children. Apart from these chores, time has to be set aside for personal well-being in order to prevent collapses and other stress symptoms that are increasingly common these days. Therefore, I see no possibility in managing yet another task, especially one that demands a lot of work and responsibility. Taking on the responsibility to care for one's elderly means that geographical mobility is out of the question, something that many people, including me, saw as an advantage when joining the European Union and a matter of personal freedom. Due to their task and their conscience, people would have to live their lives in the same geographical area as where they grew up. Let us look at an example: Ellen is a Swedish girl and an only child from a small village in the south of Sweden called Nottraby. She wants to become a French teacher and to improve her French she goes off to work in Paris for a year. While waiting tables in Paris she falls in love with Guillaume, a French cook. She decides to stay, marries Guillaume and they later have twins. When the children have reached the age of 10, her mother dies and her retired father has difficulties taking care of himself due to back problems. Since Ellen is the only family left and the family carries the responsibility to care for the elderly in Sweden, she feels obligated to return to Nottraby to look after her father. I strongly oppose the idea that Ellen or any other people would have to choose between their present family on one hand and the parents on the other, when there are state institutions with adequately educated staff to do so. If the state leaves it entirely up to families to look after their elders, what happens to the elders who don't have a family? Because of expenses of having children many women prefer to get a good education leading to a well-paying job first. This may mean they do not have children at all since there is not enough time to find a life partner and have babies before the menopause. Many women and men are also unable to have children due to physical or even mental reasons. Thus, there would have to be some sort of institution anyway to take care of the childless elders. Institutions for the elderly is something we can not live without in our modern and demanding society.
EE385	1	﻿ The distribution revolution A burning issue in the world of music distribution today is the existence and usage of the computer program Napster. With the help of this program it is possible to share music files with other users of the program. The company behind Napster provides a database in which the users can search for what they want to download. The download itself is preformed only between two ordinary computers connected to the Internet. As the music is shared between private computers it's hard to control if the copyright of the music is violated. This is where the record companies come in. They don't like the fact that their music is freely available on the Internet without their control. To protect their interests several record companies has filed a lawsuit against Napster in order to get the service stopped. It has not been stopped yet but Napster is probably going to get stopped in the near future. I don't think the record companies are doing exactly the right thing. I think that record companies should collaborate with Napster and use their technology as a new way to distribute music. y main argument for that the record companies should use this new technology is that it's impossible to stop this development with music sharing on the Internet. The Napster community has today about 51 million registered users and if it's suddenly stopped it will result in a huge demand for something to replace it. Programs with almost the same functionality as Napster already exist and it probably wouldn't take long before Napster would be fully replaced. Because of the reason that I just mentioned it's better to cooperate with Napster than just to stop it. I'm not saying that the illegal copying of copyright protected music is going to end but this is a very good opportunity for the music industry to reduce it and at the same time make profit form it. As Napster is such a widely spread program it makes it a good foundation for use as a new distribution channel. Napster would naturally have to be transformed into a membership-based community where the members either pays a membership fee or pay for the music that they download. Another side of the issue is the users, which I haven't mentioned yet. They will be forced to pay for something that previously has been free of charge. Naturally quite a lot of the users will stop using the service, but the ones who are willing to pay will see that it's not only a bad thing that they have to pay. If the users are forced to pay I think it's the record companies responsibility to make all their music available on the service. Then the users would have a much bigger selection of music that always would be available for download. In addition to that the sound quality of the music would be better as the only one who would publish music on the service would be the record companies which has access to better equipment than an ordinary home user. The scenario that I have pictured is actually beginning to happen. The big German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, of which a main part is the big BMG record company, has signed an agreement with Napster. This agreement is aiming towards a membership based community just as the one I have been discussing, but how this is going to be designed has not yet been decided. If this agreement becomes a success then Bertelsmann will drop the lawsuit that they currently have against Napster. I hope that all the other record companies will follow Bertelsmann's example and join them and Napster to create a community where all music is available for download. This would in the beginning only be a complement to how music is distributed today, but I believe that it's one step forward towards a different way to distribute music in the future.$$$﻿ The "real life" soap opera A few years back a new kind of program appeared in Swedish television. At first there were massive criticism against the program. This was because of the fact that one participant in the program was voted out of the program in each episode. The other participants of the program made the outvoting and this was at first seen as offensive towards the person being outvoted. The criticism soon vanished and the program became very successful. The program I am talking about is "Expedition Robinson" which has been shown four times in Swedish public service television. Expedition Robinson is a program that can be classified as being a part of the new genre of documentary soap operas. In the last year Robinson, as the program usually is called, has been joined by several other programs in this documentary soap genre. Examples of programs are "Baren", "Villa Medusa" and "Radio". These documentary soap operas are my subject in this essay. I'm going to focus on different aspects of these kind of programs, namely who watch these programs - how does it affect them and also the very name documentary, is it really a documentary? I like to watch Robinson but I don't like the other programs that classify themselves as documentary soap operas. Maybe it isn't right to classify Robinson as a documentary soap I would rather call it a pure entertainment program. If we put the labeling of the programs aside it can clearly be seen that today's new documentary soaps have been inspired by "Expedition Robinson". They all have the same concepts with people applying in to be a part of the program and the fact that some sort of out voting and contests are performed. The thing that differ the programs is where they take place and what they do, it can be on an island or in a villa in the Alps. Now over to the question who watch these programs and how does it affect them? I have been giving this some thought and I have formulated another question that I will try to answer. Is it only stupid people who watch these programs or do these programs make people stupid? Or is this totally wrong? The reason that I ask this question is that I watched a part of the first episode of "Villa Medusa" and the one thing that struck me was that all the participants in the program acted idiotically. I didn't watch long enough to really find out if they were total idiots or if they just acted a bit silly in the beginning. I hope it is the latter one, but I'm not sure. The only answer I have to the questions that I asked before is that I probably am right in the last question. It' s totally wrong. It's not possible to label a person as stupid just based on what he or she watches on television. The second thing I don't like about these kinds of programs is that they are labeled as "documentary soap operas". I believe this is an abuse of the word documentary even though it is connected with the phrase soap opera, which is a much better label for the genre. To me a documentary is a film or television program that gives facts about something real like a historic occurrence not something constructed by a production company. I would like to rename the genre; a name like "real life soap opera" would be much better. As one might have noticed I don't like documentary soap operas very much. I think they are examples of bad television entertainment, which I hope will vanish as soon as possible. I don't think the genre has more to give, all the ideas appears to be too similar to each other. If this trend continues I hope that the ones who now are watching the programs will become enlighten and realize that it is bad television entertainment.
EE148	1	﻿ Stub Out! The tobacco industry pleases its consumers by producing approx. 5 342 991 000 000 cigarettes for them per day. It is not difficult then to imagine what huge amounts of money this gigantic industry turns into cash on its product. How can that be, I wonder, when smoking is such an unhealthy and expensive thing to do? How long can it continue like this? Is the fact that tobacco companies are taken to court by individuals for having caused people's illness or even death, a sign of that we somewhere in the future will have a non-smoking world? In today's society, we are very conscious of what we eat. To keep your body fit and healthy is of great importance for most people. And I think everyone is aware of the risks for diseases related to smoking (both active and passive smoking) and how it affects your health and beauty. In spite of this there is yet a message of smoking as accepted and associated with success and glamour. Children learn from movies and commercials that it is cool to be a smoker. Try smoking is for young people a step into the exciting adult world. And of course the advertisers address to this target group. In Sweden 80 new smokers per day are claimed, to replace those who have given up smoking or even died from it. In the US this number is 5000 per day. Then there is the economy aspect of smoking (which is very much connected to the health aspect). It is a very expensive amusement both for the individual and society in large. For me as a non-smoker it seems very unnecessary having to count the expense for something that might contribute to shorten your life, in your personal budget. The causes of smoking that affect society's economy consequently also affect the economy of people in general. Diseases from smoking make people who normally should work, having to be on sickness benefit or even get early retirement pension. In the US many states are bringing actions against tobacco companies to get compensation for damages caused by smoking. The companies then argue that the individual smoker is responsible for his/her decision and should be aware of the consequences of smoking. One can then wonder to what extend the tobacco companies inform their consumers of the risks. My third and last argument against smoking is the one that feels most important for myself. It is the fact that you involuntary have to spend some time of the day in smoky surroundings almost everyday and often meet a lack of consideration for non-smokers among many smokers. The Swedish tobacco law from 1993, says that smoking is forbidden in all places of work, schools and other public buildings. (To have special "smoking rooms" is allowed.) I don't think I have noticed any remarkable difference since this law was introduced, though. The restaurants' and cafés' non-smoking areas for example, do not often make any sense since you are still in the same room and the smoke doesn't stay in the "smokers' area" just because there is a rule. I want to be able to sit in a café without having to bring the nasty smell from smoke with me home in my clothes and hair. In many public institutions, for example hospitals, the entrances turn into smoking areas with big stinking ashtrays and when going in you get "welcomed" by the disgusting smell from fag-ends. So, what is it then that makes people smoke despite everything, in my view, speaking against it? Perhaps it is a need, a feeling of being something more with that cigarette in the corner of their mouths or/and a lust that is stronger than the question of health and money. Whatever it is, it is something that I as a non- (and never-) smoker can't understand it and don't think I ever will.$$$﻿y first actual contact with the English language was in third grade in compulsory school. I remember I was really looking forward to it. I was going to learn how to speak and read in a foreign language. It felt like it made me grow up a little bit! I don't remember how many English lessons we had a week at that time but I remember that a teacher came to our little school only for those occasions. I suppose my ordinary teacher wasn't certificated for it or simply didn't want to teach English. Well, I liked learning some English words and I liked the English lessons for the rest of compulsory school as well. And it was pretty cool to be able to speak some when being abroad, in Greece for example. At senior high school though, I did of some reason lose my interest for English. I felt it like everyone in my class was doing much better than me. Many of my friends had been to England or the United States taking language courses during some weeks in the summer. Now when looking back at that time I don't think I actually was much worse than the others, perhaps instead bad self-confidence was the reason why I wasn't so active on the English lessons. Of course I did do the exercises in the books, read what we were supposed to read and answer the questions I got. But I didn't throw myself into discussions though, and speeches in front of the class weren't exactly 'my cup of tea'. One year after senior high school, I got to know about a one semester English course in Portslade near Brighton in Great Britain. It is a course you apply for through Visings Folk High School in Sweden. There are only Swedish students on the course but all teachers and staffs are Englishmen/women. And your accommodation during the course is with an English family. I went there hoping to improve my English and also to get a glimpse of British society and culture. This was accordingly the first time I was really forced to speak English. I was surprised how easy it was to get into the language. I surely did lots of grammatically mistakes but that wasn't so important at that moment. The main thing was that I actually dared to speak and put my trust in that people understood me. I think the best way of learning a language, is to stay in a country where that language is spoken, for a while. Of course we studied grammar, wrote essays and so on the course, but I think I learn most just by listening, speaking and constantly being "surrounded by English", written and spoken. Now, when going to study English again (and this time on a more advanced level), I feel a bit unused to it because I haven't practised it for a while. But I think, or at least hope, it will be quite easy to get into it again, at least the listening part. I think that is the easiest thing, unless the speaker has got some, for me unknown, dialect or anything. When it comes to reading I think it depends very much of what you are reading, whether it is difficult or not. When reading an English-written novel, I may not understand exactly all of the words, but I can get the story on the whole anyway. If reading specialist literature, though, it might be a bit more difficult, due to the fact that there may be lots of words that I normally don't get into contact with. According to speaking, as I mentioned before, I think it's a question of self-reliance for me. When I was in England I think I improved my speaking ability a lot, at least to use the language in everyday speech. I hope I will get into the language like that again now and also enlarge my vocabulary (in writing as well, of course). What I also would like to develop more is my pronunciation. At this moment I think there is sometimes too much a mix of Swedish-, American-, and British English in my language. My dream is to get a consistently British pronunciation and fluency in my speaking. (I think I have a long way to get there, though!) Concerning myself, I think, writing in English is the most difficult part. Maybe not spelling words right, but handling with the grammar right, knowing what expression or word fit where, and getting a clear structure in my composition, are, among other, things that I have to practise more. That's common for all of the four skills that I've mentioned - I have to practise a lot!
EE502	1	﻿ TV Violence In the article Locking out violence, in TIME Magazine July 24 1995, Ginia Bellafante takes up a very important issue, how we can protect young viewers from violence on TV. It is important that a discussion concerning ethics continuos. Not only parents, but also broadcasters have a big responsibility to protect young viewers from TV violence. I also think that it is important to determine what sort of violence could harm children and what sort could actually be good. Really young kids should off course not be exposed to any kind of violence. But when they get old enough to realise that the world is not free from bad things, we should focus on making them realise that violence is something bad. Therefore it might not be bad to let them see TV where violence is evil. If they for example would see news showing the devastation that war causes, they will probably not be impressed by violence. If they on the other hand would watch a TV show where the hero would solve a problem by using violence they would most likely be impressed by this and most parents do not want their children to solve their problems by using violence. Only on TV is there violence without pain. Sometimes TV violence is even supposed to be funny. Grown-ups might be able to realise that violence causes pain and sadness, but young children probably thinks that what they see is true. I think that it is alarming that the level of violence exposed to young children are getting worse, especially in cartoons. When I was a kid I used to watch cartoons that had a low level of violence and the violence that existed was pretty far from reality. If a bear, Bamse who is the worlds strongest and also the kindest bear in the world, grabs a wolf in his tale and throws him up in a pine-tree, it is not likely that a kid would try to do the same. But if two cartoon characters, who are made to look like real human-beings, are in a fight and one would hit the other in the head with a baseball-bat and he would rise again and just walk away with some birds flying around his head. Kids could get quite a strange picture of reality. Children who watch lots of violence on TV learn to fight more and might even think that violence is fun, even in real life. Parents can do a lot to keep their children away from TV violence, only by encourage them to take part in different activities, or limiting the time their children are allowed to watch TV. Another important thing would be that parents watch TV together with their kids. And afterwards they could discuss the program with the kids and talk about how TV characters solve their problems and see if they can find any alternative solutions. Not only parents, but also TV broadcasters have a big responsibility to protect children from violence. In some countries there are laws saying when broadcasters can show programs involving violence. But also in countries where such law does not exist broadcasters should try not to show such programs at an early hour. They can also warn their viewers before the program starts that it contains violence and that way parents, who watches together with their children, can make sure that their kids do not watch it. I don not think that censorship is the right way to solve this problem because that would violate peoples freedom of expression, witch I think should be a right that every person in this world should have. There is no simple solution on how we can solve the problem with children being exposed to violence on TV. But if the discussion about the problem continues more and more people might open their eyes to the problem. If parents and TV broadcasters all take their responsibility this might become a smaller problem in the future.$$$﻿ The only good Indian is a dead Indian." Most texts about American Indians written in the end of the nineteenth century are written by people who are clearly against any freedom for the Indians. These texts are trying to tell people how dangerous Indians are. There are only in a few texts where the Indians get to tell their story of what happened in the late nineteenth century; those texts are most of the time interviews. So it his basically impossible to get an objective interpretation on what it was like in this period of American history. Judson E. Walker had an attitude towards Indians that probably was quite common in the late nineteenth century in America. He basically looks upon them as if they are not human beings but some fierce creatures. "The bulk of our adult aboriginal population were born in savagery, and have lived in savagery. Try as they will, they cannot entirely subdue the savage instincts to roam at will, to defy restraint, and indulge their lawless appetites for blood and plunder." (1). He has quite clearly a subjective view when he talks about the Indians. After the battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876, where Sitting Bull and his men defeated General Custer and his men, the Indians fled to just north of the Canadian border. In the opening of the year 1879 some of Sitting Bulls men crossed the border again about this Walker says "...crossing the line and committing depredations, killing the cattle of the settlers, stealing horses, etc." (4). When some American troops were sent out to fight against the Indians they saw that they were outnumbered so they retreated and then Walker says "Many Indians were captured in the retreat, and the operations of that summer were attended with gratifying results." (4). When the Indians does something so they can survive it is described as an act of cruelty, violence, or destruction. But when the American troop captures many Indians who might not even have committed a criminal act it is described as a gratifying result. In 1885 the wife of General Custer, Elizabeth Custer, wrote a book called Boots and Sandals. The book is written in a very effective way. She describes the Indians very detailed and in the beginning she makes you wonder whether she dislikes them or not. But then she suddenly puts in a small piece that proves how she feels about Indians. "... the stained water of Little Big Horn...told how deadly and fatal that was. The vengeance of that incarnate fiend was concentrated on the man who had effected his capture. It was found on the battle-field that he had cut out the brave heart of that gallant, loyal, and loveable man, our brother Tom." (25). "I found him to be the ferocious-looking savage who had killed his enemy from another tribe and eaten his heart warm." (31). She also uses sarcasm when writes about the Indian Running Antelope who has come to her husband to implore for food and she refers to him as "...the venerable warrior..." (27). I think that what she is trying to do is to convince people that Indians are not to be trusted. That they are always trying to fool people into likening them and then 'stab them in their back' when they least suspect it. In one passage of her story, capture and escape of Rain-in-the-face, his friends and brothers come to the gaol to show their compassion towards him. Even though Rain-in-the-face is a brave warrior he shows feelings, and then Elizabeth Custer writes "The bitter revenge with which I had entered the room were for a moment forgotten, and I almost wished that he might be pardoned." (24). She herself uses the same technique to make people realise how she looks upon Indians. When you read what she has written you get a nice picture of the Indians and then suddenly she describes something terrible that they have done. And she describes them as bloodthirsty, hostile, and savage people. Most American people in the late nineteenth century had a very unfriendly attitude towards Indians, but some people became their friends. Dr. Thomas B. Marquis became a close friend of the Northern Cheyennes. He has written down how the warrior Wooden Leg describes the Rosebud fight. In most other stories from this the fight would probably be referred to as a massacre but when Wooden Leg tells the story he says that when the Indians surrounded the soldiers they killed each other or committed suicide. It is told that the Indians hardly killed any soldiers, "But they were surrounded and as all the others had done, they killed themselves. This ended the fighting on the ridge. The Indians had killed but twenty or thirty soldiers: all the rest had killed each other or had committed suicide" (8). Wooden Leg also disavows some of the things that have been believed before. One example is that General Custer believed that the Indians was warned before the battle at Little Big Horn, since they had discovered an Indian near the soldiers camp. Bud Wooden Leg says that this Indian belonged to a small Cheyenne tribe that did not join the rest of the camp until after the first day of fighting. Also in the battle at Little Big Horn did most of the soldiers kill themselves or each other. According to Dr. Marquis only 10% of Custer's men were enemy inflicted. Most white American people seem to have had a negative attitude towards Indians in the late nineteenth century. But it might be hard to get a correct picture since Indian friendly people did not write many of the text from this time.
EE144	1	﻿ Is exercise getting trendy? During the last few years of my living in Uppsala I have noticed a change in the way students, and I believe others, get their exercise. About four years ago there were not that many different alternatives for people wanted to get fit. Friskis & Svettis and the reverend Svettis were the main alternatives, both quite cheap then. But several other fitness centres began popping up, or rather began marketing, rebuilt and asked higher prices. The students who earlier were hard put to pay 350 Swedish crowns for their exercise now pay from 900 up to 1200. Svettis is rebuilt into Stallet, the old Centralbadet into Nautilus and Friskis & Svettis have enlarged their organisation. My Ju-Jutsu beginners' course was, according to the teacher, the largest in several years, and almost everyone stayed the whole course. These changes must be caused by a greater willingness of the inhabitants of Uppsala to get fit and pay for it. It may be that this is caused by some trend in society at large but as all my observations emanate from Uppsala I have to treat it as a local trend albeit affected by the environment. Could it be that suddenly, because of the reports of the dangers of being fat when older, like heart failure, students start thinking of their future old age and start exercising. Or the reports on the ever higher percent of the young which is overweight combined with advice on how to loose weight? That would mean that we read the newspapers, believe in the journalists' and experts' conclusions and follow their advice willingly in the hope of living into a healthy old age and in the bargain lower the statistics. Unfortunately, or not, it does not really fit our mindset to react that way. Where it so, we would use only half our allotted students' loan, drink not at all, go to bed at ten and eat eight to nine slices of bread a day, which we don't. Therefore it is probably not the influence of the newspapers that is the main cause. On the other hand, it could be another kind of paper that has finally reached through and got us to follow their advice; the tabloids with their tips on how to get thin. But that is probably not correct either as those tips usually only include eating less, not exercising more, and if training is included, it does not extend over more than ten minutes a day. It also seems like the training trend includes male students, who supposedly would not be as affected the tabloids, since they are mainly read by women. Several decades ago, e.g. in the forties, it was usual for people, male and female both, to carry clothes or undergarments which worked like a corset to keep an untrained body looking fit. Nowadays, however, we wear scanty clothes which mercilessly reveal if fitness is lacking while at the same time the beauty ideal is to be thinner than ever, most believe (I believe it looks rather like the 1400th - century). Owing to this it is probably more important than ever to be able to show a torso not only without fat but also lined with muscles. Even the female photo models are starting to look more trim than thin. At the same time it gets more usual for men and women to bodybuild. It is possible that feminism is one of the reasons. It is now possible for a woman to be strong and still beautiful and it is possible for a man to be vain. I am sure these are important reasons for the fitness trend but probably not the most important. It is still possible to starve into clothes, even if it probably is less fun. There is another health aspect in this matter. Studies have shown, at least according to the students' health organisation, that exercise increases the concentration span and thereby it should make it easier to study. It is probable that at least most students who start exercising discover that they get more energised and can study for longer time periods without tiring. The reason for the trend is probably a combination of the causes listed above, together with another interesting factor. It has finally become fashionable to exercise, the fitness centres are meeting places and people like to speak of and discuss where and what they do for exercise, and they want to spend money on it. It is also interesting to note the counter reaction: people that are so tired of the fitness talk that they refuse to exercise at all and simply don't care. One thing is certain; as long as this health and training wave continues it will probably be possible to ask ever higher prices of us and the only effect is that more people will attend exercise facilities. Or, as the marketing rule goes according to Kotler, there are certain goods that more people buy when the price goes up, and this might just be one.$$$﻿ THE INCREASING NUMBER OF YOUTHS USING DRUGS AT LOWER AGES Resent studies has shown that drug usage is increasing and that narcotics exist in closer contact with younger students. According to the CAN survey, 1 out of 10 students attending the 9th grade of the senior level has on one or several occasions used drugs. Compared with statistic surveys from 1995 this is an increase by 50%. The results are in line with other inquiries; for example, a study made by the social welfare service which is a 5 year long investigation series on students', in the second grade, upper secondary school, drug habits. According to the latter, 1 out of 5 pupils has tried narcotics. Of the ones that have used drugs, 40% were under the age of 16 and 11% under the age of 13 (1995: 3%) the first time they tried narcotics. Both studies show that the debut age for drug use has gone down and that the usage is increasing. They also demonstrate that the pupils' attitudes towards drugs and drug policies have become more liberal than before. Why then, do more and more young students take drugs? One answer to this question could be the students more liberal and tolerant attitude toward drugs the youths ignore and disclaim the dangers with drugs (according to the police authorities). In an article about drug abuse, one could read about a seventeen-year-old boy using ecstasy almost every weekend. He described the information received in school, concerning narcotics, to be very one-sided and that he felt he couldn't relate to it. I think he is making an important point. The information you receive in school often describe worn-out drug addicts sleeping in street corners, and imply that that is where you will end up if you take drugs. Although it is not wholly unlikely that something like this could happen to you, if using drugs, it is very difficult for young pupils to identify themselves with this picture. There is a big difference between this and taking a few pills at private parties on weekends, many of these young users are often well behaved and very social, which makes the gap and differences between them and freaked-out addicts seem huge. Another cause to the increasing number of younger students using drugs could be due to high group pressure and a desire to fit in. Youths are very vulnerable and easily affected when they are in their early teens. Most of them are trying to figure out who they are, how to act and are often deadly afraid of being classified as outsiders. It is commonly known that most people who start smoking do it because they want to fit in, to belong to a group or just want to be accepted, the same goes for drinking alcohol. Taking drugs is the third step some of us take in order to be accepted. Drugs have become the new rage and are used as a supplement to alcohol and smoking. You may think that narcotics are a considerable more dangerous mean of intoxication and that people can and do say no, but keep in mind that most youths get in contact with narcotics when they are very young and at such early ages, it is not easy to say no. The desire to fit in makes you do almost anything. Also, when living such in close contact with drugs where they are easy to obtain, which school pupils do nowadays, they are running a high risk of trying it themselves. The more that start using drugs, the more will follow. Some other factors contributing to this increase are, to begin with, the fact that it isn't very likely that you will be caught by the police. Most youths take drugs almost exclusively at private parties and usually know the person selling them their narcotics, from before. Another factor is that Sweden has not had that many problems with drugs in the past, it has not been one of the bigger social issues and I believe that is why this problem has been able to expand more freely. The number of ecstasy pills confiscated so far this year goes up to 150 000, compared with last years 75 000 pills. This trend will keep on getting bigger and bigger if we are unable to work out some sort of solution or way to stop it in the nearer future. The expansion of narcotics in Sweden is being made very fast, which makes this is a problem that needs to be paid attention to and to be acknowledged by society.
EE141	1	﻿ Little Women By Louisa M. Alcott An ideal female world without any unsolvable problems. This is the setting of Louisa M. Alcott's novel Little Women. The novel presents a romantic picture of a tranquil home where the family members love and care for each other more than anything in the world. With the father absent t is the mother who stands as the head of the family, a woman who represents the perfect woman. Mrs. March raises her four daughters to become happy and morally good women. Teaching them the right values and manners of a woman we follow the sisters development in life and turning into truly little women. The four sisters grow up in an almost only female surrounding "She [Jo] liked the "Laurence boy" better than ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them" (p. 28). In this male lacking environment Mrs. March plays an enormously big role even though she is not as much present in the novel as her daughters are. She seems only to appear in the novel when the children need help or when there are any problems or uncertainties. Exaggerating a little bit, one could say that she is the "source of truth". She has all the right answers to life's problems and the key to how a woman should behave in these days. Her daughters turn to this fountain of wisdom to learn how to behave to become better women. The girls admire their mother very much and idolize her, a mothers word is the truth they seem to believe. How the children look upon their mother is well described in Amy's thoughts when she looks at the picture of the Virgin Mary and comparing it to her own mother "...and Amy's beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking at the sweet face of the divine mother, while tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart" (p. 179). Mrs. March, who represents the ideal female figure of this time with a good morals, a happy life with a wonderful husband, though he is absent at the moment, four beautiful daughters, she knows what a woman should be like to be happy and lead a good life. She tries to teach good values to her children so that they will live up to her dreams about them one day becoming good persons "I want my daughter's to be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be admired, loved, and respected; to have a happy youth, to be well and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send... I'd rather see you poor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace" (p. 92). In this speech she mentions money, which she tries to teach her children is not the most important thing in the world. The girls often complains about how poor they are and how many nice things their friends have and they do not, at those times the mother steps in preaching about how much richer they are who are so much loved by each other and their family, and that money does not automatically mean happiness "Money is a needful and precious thing-and, when well used a noble thing-but I never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for" (p. 92). The four girls in the novel Little Women are four very different characters. They each represent one kind of a typical woman figure during this time in history. Women were supposed to like art, music and sewing, and these sisters are not any exceptions. They spend their time painting, writing reading, playing the piano or sitting together sewing. eg represents the beautiful and romantic woman who wants to be a person like her mother. She likes dressing up in beautiful gowns and being appreciated for her beauty "But it is nice to be praised and admired, and I can't help saying I like it" said Meg..." (p. 91). Her younger sister Beth is the girl who spends her time taking care of everybody else, humans, animals or dolls, it does not make any difference for her. She is also the sister who enjoys music, and she loves to play the piano and sing. Amy has also got typical interest for girls of that time, she is the one who loves art and paints a lot. While three of the sisters are very girlish and behaving in a womanly way, the fourth one Josephine has other things on her mind. Josephine is the sister who rebels against this typical woman figure who enjoys a tranquil life filled with beauty. Although she also sews and writes a lot she has troubles in growing up to a women and sometimes wishes that she was a boy "If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time; but as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home" (p. 196). She sees herself as the male person in the house now when their father is away "I'm the man of the family now Papa is away..." (p. 6). One specific thing she does to rebel against the female ideal picture is to "change" her name to Jo, which is a little more boyish "I hate my name, too-so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine" (p. 27). She sometimes uses a language that is not appropriate for a girl and the picture painted up her mother of the ideal woman with beautiful dresses and being modest does not appeal to Jo. She does not bother much about what other people say about her or what to wear, like other girls were thinking of at that time "I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China aster! It's bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and manners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy..." (p. 5). One of the most important things they learn from their mother is that one should always take care of one another. The girls follow this advice very carefully. Meg and Jo are both working with taking care of other people, little Beth nurses her poor doll in a very touching way, and the way the take care of each other is remarkable. It really shows how strong their love is for each other and how important the family is "We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another" (p. 36). The four sisters hang on to each other at all times. They sew together, have secret clubs and they play together, they cry together. How close they are to each other is obvious in Jo's jealousy towards Mr. Brooke and his plans of marrying Meg "I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family" (p. 187). To listen and learn from one's mother seemed to be important during that time. Mrs. March learned many things from her mother, and now she is passing her knowledge along to her own children ""My good mother used to help me-" "As you do us-" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss" (p. 76). The things the girls do and the things they say are all a result of their mother's teachings. Mrs. Marches motherly feeling towards her two oldest children makes them take on the role as a mother to their younger sisters "The two older girls were a great deal to one another, but each took on of the younger into her keeping and watched over her in her own way-"playing mother" they called it-and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women" (p. 39). The world the girls live in is a very secure place for them. It consists of only female characters with the right values. They rely on their mother and each other for love and protection. The mother is so important to the four girls that they have her on equal level with God "...all day Jo and Meg hovered over her [Beth], watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and Mother" (p. 174). When Beth is sick for a long period of time and the other girls believes that the end is near for her, they learn that their mother is on her way home, and everything changes. As a God or a supernatural being, she returns to her depressed daughters making everything well again "A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change...the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness; and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, "Mother's coming, dear! Mother's coming!"" (p. 173). It is truly an idealistic world the four sisters are living in, where the mother is the protector and preacher, teaching her children to become good persons. Important values she teaches her daughters concern love, caring and happiness. Any obstacles that come along their journey through life they can overcome together as a family. This family March represents the perfect family, even though they live without their father for a long time, and the typical female characters of this period in history. Their time is devoted to sewing, music, art, literature and learning morals and good values "...the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood" (p. 162).$$$﻿1. Introduction English is one of the most spoken languages in the world. There are many varieties spread around the whole world, of which British English and American English are the two largest groups. Many young people today chose to spend a year or more in the United States to either study or work. Since we Swedes have been taught English in school since the fourth grade the language should not cause any big problems. Nevertheless there are differences between the school English, which is most often British English, and the American variety. I was myself a foreign exchange student in Minnesota and have experienced the variation in vocabulary. In some cases it would have been nice if I had known the correct word, it could have saved me from embarrassing moments. Therefor I think it is interesting to see what words and how many that are different in the two languages. Are there any word classes that differs the most and within any special areas? 1.2. Material and method I have used the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English and International English by P. Trudgill and J. Hannah. To find out how frequent it is that words are different I took out the first 1,000 words of the letters A, B, C, and D, a total of 4,000 words from Longman. I looked at the words to find out which ones that had different forms but the same meaning in the two languages and also which words that only exist in American English respectively British English. This method may not be completely accurate though. First because Longman Dictionary comes from the British National Corpus, and even though it contains many American words I believe the result would look different if I had used an American edition of a dictionary. Secondly, many words that are different are slang words and all of them are naturally not represented in this dictionary. It does however show the frequency of different words in more formal written and spoken English. When I looked at different areas of words where there were differences between the two languages I used both Longman and International English by P. Trudgill and J. Hannah. In this investigation I only included words that are different not ones that exist in one only one of the languages. I have not all included every word that is different, and this investigation is based on my own associations with the areas so if someone else would have done it it would probably not have looked te same. 2. Result of frequency investigation Of the total number of 4,000 words I found 248 that differed in some way between AmE and BrE. 75 words had different forms with the same meaning in the two languages (Appendix 1). 73 words existed only in AmE (Appendix 2), and 100 in BrE (Appendix 3). The rest were words can could be used in both AmE and BrE. Figure 1 Figure 1 shows the percentage of the kind of different words I found. Out of the total number of 4,000 words 1.88% had different forms but the same meaning in the two languages. 1.83% of the words were only found in AmE and 2.53% in BrE. The results of the study of frequency of different words in AmE and BrE shows that there are not so many words that are different, at least not in a dictionary. I believe though that there are much more words that differ in the everyday speech in the two countries, if one include slang words and dialect differences. The investigation shows though that a British person can communicate with an American without any problems. When I looked at what word classes the words belonged to I found that 85.5% of all words were nouns, 6.5% adjectives, 6% verbs, 1.2% adverbs and 0.008% interjections. The nouns are obviously the most common word class that differs between the languages. It was also the case when I looked at the letters individually. Of the 73 words that were only found in AmE 78.1% were nouns, 8.2% verbs, 7% adjectives, 2.7% adverbs and 1.4% interjections. Also of the 100 only BrE words the nouns were most frequent, 87% nouns, 8% adjectives, 3% verbs, 1% adverbs and 1% interjections. Figure 2 Figure 2 shows clearly that the nouns with 85,5% are the word class that differ the most in the two languages. There are several factors that tribute to the change in vocabulary between the two languages. When Britain colonized North America new words and experiences had to be named and they did that by taking already existing BrE words or invent new ones, also technological and cultural developments have caused differences in the vocabulary. A third reason is the influence of other languages (Trudgill and Hannah, 1985:75-6). This is, I believe, the most important cause today, since many people from all over the world immigrate to the United States. There they are mixed up with several nationalities and have to learn to communicate with each other, in that way many new words arises, many of which are loan words from their native languages. 3. Words in special areas If one look at words from different areas one can see that there are many words with the same meaning but not the same form. In many fields the vocabulary is quite different. I looked at three areas where the vocabulary differs, education, food, and clothing. 3.1. Education In the area of education there are several words that are different in AmE and BrE. Since the two countries do not have the same school system there are naturally words that only exist in one of the languages and not in the other. Therefor there are many AmE words for which one can not find a corresponding word in BrE and vice versa. I believe many foreign exchange students may have had some problems in an American high school. 3.1.1. Table 1 - educational word that differed AmE BrE Eraser Rubber Semester Term Principal Head teacher Class Course Vacation Holiday Bulletin board Notice board Freshman Fresher Grade Mark Field day Sport day Drop-out School-leaver Grade Form Prom Ball Sophomore Second year student Table 1 shows words that have the same meaning but not the same form in the AmE and BrE, There are also a few words that are used in both languages but have different meanings. Junior and varsity are two such words. In AmE a junior is a student who is in his second year in high school, while a junior in Britain is a pupil in a junior school and between 7-11 years old. Varsity is a common word in the US used for the main team in a sport that represents the school. It is not a very common word in BrE but it exists as an old-fashioned word for a university, especially Oxford or Cambridge. 3.2. Food 3.2.1.

Conclusion After studying a total of 4,000 words in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English I found only 248 words that were different in AmE and BrE. Some of them had different forms but same meanings, while some were only found in AmE and some in BrE. In the investigation on word classes I found that the majority of the words were nouns. In my investigation on words in the areas of education, food and clothing, I found every day words that are different in America and Britain. This investigation is based on a dictionary taken from the British National Corpus. It did not show many differences between the languages, but I beloieva that if i had used an American dictionary as a complement I would have gotten a different result. Many o fthe words I found in Longman could be used in both AmE and BrE, but often a word that was common in for example AmE was not so frequently used in BrE. This means that even though a BrE word is not used in the United States, it is often understood anyway, it may just sound strange. A foreigner with knowledge of BrE can manage without any major problems in the United States of America. 5.

EE549	0	﻿ Stop smoking! Did you know that tobacco is one of the most common causes of premature death? Only in Sweden 8 000 persons every year die of diseases caused by smoking. Do you want to be a number in these statistics or do you want to get free from the devil that poisons your body? You may say that you cannot stop smoking, but I wonder why. Is it just because it is an old, bad habit, or do you actually like inhaling toxins, just as I once did? But, at last I did stop, and I will try to convince you in the following few paragraphs that you can gain a lot by stop smoking. I remember waking up with a terrible taste in my mouth and feeling the phlegm all the way from the bottom of my lungs to the tip of my tongue. I remember coughing all day long. Even when I tried to laugh the cough would stop me. I felt like an 80 years old lady whose best friend has been the cigarette for a quite some time. But still, I didn't quit. I will try not to discuss one major disease related to smoking, and that is cancer. I suppose that you have already heard and maybe even read a lot about it. Instead, I will give you some scary information about other afflictions. It is not just coughing and the extra production of phlegm, but also a number of other lung related affections and diseases that you can catch. When you get the chronic obstructive lung disease, which is a combination of chronic bronchitis and tissue damages in the lungs and which makes it very hard to breathe so that you eventually need the oxygen, you might wish that you had never begun to smoke. There are gases, particles and fumes in each puff from a cigarette that contain more than 4 000 different substances and chemical compounds. We can see only about five percent of the smoke and the rest is invisible to the eye. Some of the substances contained in the cigarette fumes were used to execute people in gas chambers (hydrogen cyanide). Others are used as cleaning agents and fertilizers (ammoniac), preserving agents (formaldehyde) and nail polish removers (acetone). I could round up a number of different substances, but I know that it would not mean a thing to you. It surely never meant anything to me. If I cannot scare you with the diseases and substances, maybe I can deter you by making you aware of how ugly you become when you are a smoker. Take a look at your fingers, the ones in which you hold the cigarette so gently, and see if your skin is turning orange or yellow. I used to scrub my fingers with a lemon hoping that the stains would come out. Of course, they never did. One more thing is the bad looking discoloration of your teeth, which you get whether you want it or not. Last but not least when it comes to your appearance, I do not know if you have noticed, but you are followed by the big, stinking smoke cloud. If you are still a smoker and you have not been discouraged, then my job is to continue by pointing out what you can gain if you quit smoking. After just a couple of days you will start to notice how your complexion is getting smooth and how the color comes back to your face, so that you do not look ill, pale or yellowish anymore. And you certainly do not go around dragging the big, stinking cloud and your breath is much fresher. If you sometimes felt that your hands or feet were cold, even if it was 25 degrees outside, then the reason to that might be the bad blood circulation. Without the cigarettes, all of a sudden, you can feel your toes and fingers even if it is cold outside. And it is such a pleasant feeling. To round off my arguments, I will throw the following figures in your face: imagine that you smoke one pack of cigarettes per day at a cost of 36 Swedish krona. This would mean that in one year you would spend approximately 13 000 Swedish krona. Can you imagine what you could do with so much money?$$$﻿ English, My English Introduction To study English has been both pleasure and pain for me. Lately most pleasure. Before I started to study English I studied geography here in Uppsala. The geography department gave me the opportunity to go to the University of Leicester in England for one semester to study geography as an Erasmus student. It was this experience that made me interested in the English language and that made me take this course in English. This essay will deal with how competent I feel about my English at this point. Therefore I'm going to reveal my strengths and weaknesses of listening, reading, speaking and writing the English language. I'm going to start to tell you about my ability to write. To be honest I feel that I'm not that competent in any of these areas but my five-month-stay in England made me more complete. Out of the four skills, I mentioned earlier, I think my writing is the strongest. During my stay I wrote about 20 000 words divided into eight essays. All my essays were passed but yet no one ever marked them according to the language therefore, I think this course will do me good. Nowadays it doesn't take me that much time to write as it did before but grammatically I still have a great deal to do, which I am aware of. Moreover I realised that my spelling was better than I thought. When I went to the lectures in geography I noticed that although I had to write very fast, to keep up with what the lecturer said, I was able to spell the words right. However, I couldn't always follow the lecturers arguments. According to the lecturers arguments my ability to listen to English and understand the meaning of what is said is quite good. I have noticed that I understand the language better when I'm not alone with an English speaking person. When I'm alone I tend to get nervous and tensed, I try too hard to listen to what this person has to say, which makes it difficult to get the point sometimes. If there are a group of people listening to this person I'm more relaxed and I understand so much more. When it comes to reading I can sit on my own and ponder about what the author has to say and I can take as much time as I want to understand. I guess that is why I read as slow as a snail walks. Well, it isn't that bad but it takes quite some time for me to read, for instance a novel. For this reason I have learned that it isn't possible to check all the words that I don't understand. It just simply takes too much time therefore I just check the words that are important fore the context but still it takes quite some time for me to read. As I don't read books in my spare time, which I will have to do now at this course in English, I know that my ability to read will be better. Let us turn to my ability to speak. Before I came to England I hadn't talked so much English but since I was there I had to speak. I used the English I had learn at school and I felt that it was a couple of years since I studied English, more exactly three years. Consequently, I had some troubles in the beginning but in the end I had improved my speaking and I even thought in English. So today I feel comfortable talking to people I know but when it comes to bigger groups my confidence fail me and the size of my vocabulary. Conclusion I have realised that I have improved the four skills of speaking, listening, writing and reading during my stay in England and today I feel more complete, both linguistically and as a person in fact. The two skills I developed most was my speaking and writing. My stay in England was a step closer to the English language, it made me interested, and my intention is to develop these skills as much as possible in the future.
EE267	1	﻿ "What would become of them?" She was born in Scotland, she married a decent enough man, she emigrated together with him to a new land; away from the coal mines, away from the black coal dust, away from the gloomy faces, away to something new, something else, something that she thought must be better. Ellen McIvor represents the novel's caring character. She is the good wife that stands behind her husband, she is the mother of two daughters and a foster-child, she has seen two of her children die, a boy and a girl, but still she cares and takes care of her whole family but she also has room in her heart for the stranger and outcast of the book, Gemmy. In David Maloufs book Remember Babylon we meet Ellen who is a good representative for the women who emigrated from the British Isles during the Victorian era. She is a product of the working class of the industrial revolution and her main worry in life is what will become of her children; her own two and the third, her brothers child, that she sees as a sacred thrust. Her will power is still strong and unbroken in spite of all the hardship she has gone trough. This fact does Malouf highlight with his references to her two dead children; "She had left more of herself than she dared consider... in the two small graves she knew she would not se again,..." The two small graves in the black soil represents both the fact that she can not go back neither to the place where she grew up in Scotland nor back in time to a time when she did not had so many worries and her future where brighter. But they also represent the circumstances that so many women in the 19-th century had to live under, the book takes place during the time period when the industrial countries of the world either went trough or just before they went trough the demographic transition, so children's mortality rates are high. Most women of this century, and women of the centuries before back trough time, followed one child or more to the grave. It is the caring side of Remember Babylon that Ellen McIvor stands for. It is she who persuades her husband Jock to take him into their household "'But Jock,' she said quietly, 'look at the puir creature!" Sometimes late in the night when Gemmy cries out because of a night mare and the rest of the family starts to stir, it is she who makes them go back to sleep. "She would lay her hand on her husband's arm. He would settle, the child would settle." It is not that she not worries, she worries a lot for her family and for their future but she has to live for the moment. If she would live in her memories she would not survive out in the harsh foreign landscape that she and Jock has settled down to farm. Sometimes Ellen longs for Scotland but it is not for the life she once had. "But she had few regrets for the world she had left - perhaps because she had none at all for her youth. She lived in the demands of the moment, in the girls, in Lachlan, and was too high spirited, too independent, to care whether other women approved of her." What she longs for are the signs of the generations who have lived and died before her; because the place, the little village in the middle of nowhere, where she lives, and probably will die, has a certain fearful loneliness. "the absence of ghosts. Till they arrived no other lives had been lived here." "They would be the first dead here. It made death so much lonelier, and life so much lonelier too." This is what frightens Ellen, this and the thought of her children's future. We never learns anything about Ellen's feelings when Gemmy moves from the McIvors to Mrs Hutchence but probably she felt that she had to put her own family's safety before Gemmy. We do not know if she died there in the village or what happened in her life after Gemmy moved out. But we do know that her daughter Janet becomes a nun and an expert on bees. Her foster-child Lachlan later in life becomes a member of the House and a minister. How Ellen ends her life we will never know, but we do know that her children did become something. Ellen represents David Malouf's picture of the women who emigrated in the 19-th century. She is a good wife and a caring mother whit a big heart. But at the same time she is a tough woman shaped by life's rougher sides. She has a strong spirit and that is what makes her survive in Australia's backcountry.$$$﻿ "Bread and entertainment" - or McDonalds and TV-violence? In the old Rome the emperor kept the inhabitants of the city happy with bread and violent public entertainment such as gladiator contests. Today we go to the supermarket or McDonalds to buy our food but our television offers us the same kind of entertainment - Violence. Has anything really changed during two thousand years of evolution? This is a question that very well might be asked when the TV Guide is studied. Violence is one of the most common elements in TV-programs, movies and above all the TV-news. What is it that makes humans so fascinated by violence? Probably it has something to do with power and safety, to sit home in the sofa in front of the TV and see Jean-Claude van Damme beat up another man gives us an adrenaline rush, a thrilling sensation runs down our spine, but it is a safe feeling because we know that the violence is not for real or at least that it is not happening to ourselves. I think that the fact that the violence is done to someone else is quite important. It is probably because of this fact that police programs which shows real killings and car chases are so popular. We can sit home and gloat in violence in safety and there is an extra spice added with the fact that this the real thing. We are at the same time repulsed by this fact and fascinated of it. Are there then anything that separate us from our Roman forefathers? Yes two things, we are more sophisticated in our taste for violence and we are also much more comfortable, we do not even have to leave our houses to satisfy our craving for violence. How does this then affect our society? The question is in fact: Does this affect our society at all? The number of murders, rapes and thefts in Sweden today are in fact on about the same level as it was a hundred years ago. The only difference is that the violence has changed its appearance, it is rawer today than it was a hundred years ago. Another factor that has changed is that the public are more aware of the violence today. Many rapes and other kinds of abuse were earlier kept in the silent, today it is instead on the front page of our newspapers. The violence is also closer to us, it has taken the step over our threshold into our homes. We can read about it in the morning paper, see it on the evening news and it has become rawer. Today the picture of violence is much more distinct than it has been. But it is the same violence that it has always been. The only difference seems to be that it is talked about in a different way today and brought out in the open to a higher degree. Can there then be any connection between entertainment violence and crimes? There is no evidence of this. Of course the opposite can not be proved either. It seems to be more a question of social causes like poverty, family troubles and so on then to much TV watching. No, the real danger with TV-violence seems to be the blunting process which the viewers go through. The violence which twenty years ago would give the audience nightmares is today something shown on primetime. In the beginning of the last decade the movie Natural Born Killers was made, the director made it as a statement. It was supposed to be the most violent movie ever made until then and it should work as an eye-opener to the viewers, today it is just a movie among many others. The amount of violence needed to abhor us has been raised to a new level, the humans of today are blunted creatures. This is the real danger of TV-violence. It is because of this we should not allow our children to watch action movies. The question that must be raised is: Do we want to have blunted children or children with feelings?
EE266	1	﻿ Slavery is not dead! Although slavery is outlawed by several of the most widely ratified international Conventions and by legislation in almost every country, slavery is not dead. Estimates working for ILO (International Labour Organisation) and the United Nations put the number of child slaves into tens of millions. Children are regularly found working in manifestly hazardous and arduous situations. They haul wagons underground in coalmines, they draw molten glass in stifling temperatures, they squat on the workshop floor for many hours making carpets for example. This form of slavery, children working with there own lives at stake to almost no money at all, has to be stopped for several different reasons. One reason is the fact that to hard work ruins a child physically. Children are susceptible to all of the dangers that are faced by adult workers when placed in the same situation, but they are more seriously affected because they differ from adults in their anatomical, physiological characteristics. The health effect can be devastating, causing irreversible damage to their physical development. To use unnatural positions or carry heavy loads at work can permanently distort or disable growing bodies. Children suffer more readily from chemical hazards and radiation than do adults, and children also have less resistance to diseases. Children are less aware of their rights and they have never got a chance to learn how to defend themselves, which makes it easier to hire children to do dangerous and laborious work But children doing hard work in poor working conditions to a disgraceful salary do not only suffer physically. They are also subjected to psychological suffer. Children suffer deeper psychological damage when they are denigrated. The expectations of the children working are often high and they work under hard pressure. In most cases far to high regarded to their age. With all the information above in mind you ask your self why and how can so many children today, in 1999, be exposed to hazardous work? Poverty emerges as the most compelling reason why children work. Poor households need the money. But it can not be said, however, that poverty necessary causes child labour. The picture varies. There are regions in poor countries where child labour is extensively practised while in other equally poor regions it is not. Kerala State in India, for example, though poor, has in fact abolished child labour. So irrespective of poverty in a country is it important that a lot of efforts are put to eliminate hazardous child labour, independently of poverty reduction. It is important that the children, with help from the government working through local organisations, are offered a choice. Otherwise it easily gets into at bad circle. If a child for example do not has the chance to attend school the possibility for him/her to get a well-paid job is almost impossible. The child grows into an adult trapped in unskilled and badly paid jobs. He/she later get children that he/she cant provide for...they have to work in order the stay alive or work off family depts. The children grow up whiteout education, get children... To conclude hazardous work not only harms children physically, it also exposes the children to great psychological pressure and restrain them from getting an education. I completely agree with UNICEF's article 32 for children rights, abridged saying that: "The child has the right to be protected from work that threatens his or her health, education or development" It should be every child's right to develop in freedom and get the opportunity to education and a worthy life. We can not allow slavery!$$$﻿ Parental responsibility for children and there TV habits Today a lot of children spend so much time in front of the TV that it becomes their primary window on the world. Children can learn a lot of good things by watching TV and TV can be a source of amusement and comfort. But it can also be something frightening that introduces the child to a world of hate and violence. According to statistics compiled by the National Association of Attorneys General, published in a report on Television violence: "A Review of the Effects on Children of Different Ages", by Wendy Josephson, the average American child will see 8 000 murders on TV by the time he or she is 12. And have viewed more than 200 000 acts of violence by the time they graduate from high school. In just one hour, children can see five to six violent acts on prime time TV, and 20 to 25 violent acts during each hour of Saturday morning children's programs. Today after a lot of studies on the topic its clear that there is a correlation between a lot of viewing on violent television and children's aggressive and violent behaviour. Violent crime among 15-years-old American males has increased by 264 percent between 1989 and 1993. And homicide is the second leading death for youths ages 15-24. (This also according to the study by the Vational Association of Attorneys General mentioned above). So before the young generation of today turn the world into the violent place they know from the TV responsibility need to be taken to decrease the amount of violent TV impressions that they meat every day. Parents need to carry a lot of that responsibility. They are the ones who ought to live closest to their children and therefore also the ones who should be able to follow their TV habits. And there are a number of measures parents can do to reduce the hours their children spend in front of the TV. First of all its important to set up rules about how much it is allowed to watch TV early in the upbringing. And another good thing is to watch what programs the children is watching. Parents can also try to motivate the children to other activities like playing games, read, go on picnics or take part in sports. Much when it comes reducing children TV habits is about trying to avoid that the TV becomes the focal point in their home. For example it's a good habit not to watch TV during mealtimes and even if we live in the end of the 20th century you don't have to have a television in each room and the access to hundreds of satellite chanels. But even though it is a good thing to counteract that children watch to much violence on TV there is no way to control if and what children watch on TV when they are home alone or at friends. So perhaps even more important than setting up rules etc is to discuss violence on TV with the children. Make sure that the children don't confuse acts on television with how things work, ought to work, in reality. And perhaps also discuss different kind of violence, violence in historical movies in contrast to violence in science fiction movies, for example Those things mentioned above concerning how to decrease that children adapt bad, violent behaviour from what they watch on TV implies that parents are home a lot and spend a lot of time together with their children. Something that far too many parents don't have the possibility to do today. Many work from early morning until late evening, or live in separated relationships and alone have to provide for several children, which makes it impossible to give each child all the attention that it needs. Therefor parents need help to control the impact that TV gets on their children. For example there needs to be severe age limits at movies etc. Producers, advertisers and broadcasters also need to take their responsibility to obstruct that violence is too easily accessibly for children, even if it means that it reduces their potential audience and avenue. And with regard to the amount of hours children spend at a day nursery or in school a continuing discussion concerning violence and its effects is necessary there as well as at home. To conclude, parents by a lot of different measures need to take a lot off responsibility to obstruct the negative impact that TV violence has on children. But since they can't be with their children night and day they need support from outside as well. We can't let the TV be a child's only window on the world unless we want a reality that reflects the wickedness so often exploited on TV.
EE542	0	﻿Introduction In this essay I will tell you about my skills in English regarding listening, reading, speaking and writing. I will try to be as accurate as I possibly can, but it has been difficult to evaluate my own skills. Even if I do not success in my evaluation of my skills, at least you will know what I think that I am good or bad at. y skills I think I have my best skill in listening right now. I can understand what is said at our lectures without problems. If I were put at a lecture for doctors though, I do not think that I would be able to follow, since there are a lot of terminology that I do not think that I would understand. But as long as the language is spoken without terminology in subjects strange to me, I think I can understand most of it. I can watch English movies and understand almost everything that the actors say, sometimes I do not understand a particular word, but usually I can understand the content anyway. Besides the problem with terminology I can have problems to understand if someone talks a broad dialect that I am not used to. But as I said earlier I think that listening is my strongest skill right now. Reading is not a big problem either, but it takes me a while to get used to read in English. I can read a book and understand its content even though I do not know the meaning of every word in it. My vocabulary is not great, but most of the time I can guess the meaning of the word I do not understand by looking at the whole sentence or paragraph. Of course there are times when I have to look up words in the dictionary to understand the content of what is written, but I enjoy reading and I do not at all mind doing it in English. When it comes to speaking I am afraid that it is obvious that I do not use my English that often. I have never been to England or any other English speaking country so I do believe that I have a "school" English. I can have problems finding the words and sometimes, for example if someone comes up to me and ask about directions in English it can sound as if I recently learned how to speak English when I try to answer. But my strength in speaking lies in that I am not afraid to speak. I will try to explain the directions as good as I possible can even though my pronunciation is bad and the words may come out in the wrong order. I do have another weakness regarding speaking though and that is, that if I am in a large group I do not like to speak, but as long as there are a small group I do not mind it. Then to the last skill, writing. This is another skill that shows how little I have used my English since the second year in upper secondary school. It has been nearly five years since I last studied English, and even then I did not write that much, so I am not at all used to write in English and I am afraid that a lot of my knowledge about grammar, that I once had, are now forgotten. I do not know the rules any more, I usually go on how it "sounds". As I have written I think that my strong skills are listening and reading, and my weaker skills are talking and writing, but I have great expectations that I will improve all of my skills in English during this semester. The skill that will be the hardest one for me to improve, I think will be the grammar part. But since there are a lot of grammar exercises and some writing assignments I think that if I just put my mind to it and work hard, I will be able to improve my skill in grammar enormously. As a whole I think that this semester will one of my most instructive ones.$$$﻿ Evaluation- an assessment of my skills in listening to, reading in, writing in and speaking the English language The skills mentioned in the subtitle to this text are all, of course, influenced by each other. For example: words you hear you can use in your writing and when you're writing you are simontaneously reading what you produce and when you read it out loud, whoops, your speaking! Despite this - call it stubbornness if you like, I, myself, would like to label it convenient - I will treat my skills in these areas in seperate sections of this essay. I'll start off with my skills in listening to, then reading in, followed by writing in and finally my skills in speaking the English language will be discussed. Listening to English is something which is easily practised just by watching english-speaking movies or listening to the recently opened radiostation Right on radio (broadcasting in Stockholm, and Uppsala, I think). And this is what I try to do. When going to the movies I try to listen to what the actors are saying as opposed to reading the subtitles. I think I'm pretty good at understanding spoken English, especially american English, partly 'cause I spent some time in Colorado, five years ago as an exchange student. I still have trouble discerning if someone says peace or peas for example, though. I wasn't aware of the existence of this buzzing sound until I got to the US and it took some time for me to grasp it. Since my junior level of high school I've regularly read English novels and short-stories, along with Swedish ones. I think English sometimes can be more interesting to read since there are many more ways in which the authors can express themselves. I look up words occasionally when I read, but not as a rule. I guess the meaning of many words that are foreign to me, usually by the context they're in or from affixes I know of. I think I have a fairly good knack of reading english texts, probably more in respect of fiction. Though, I've studied Library and Information science the last two years, where I read some rather difficult texts concerning the organisation of information in general and the way Search engines on the WWW handle documents and their content in particular. In Colorado I explored writing in English in a much wider sense than before (or after; up until now, perhaps) much thanks to a class I took called "Creative writing". For one semester I wrote poetry, short plays and a short story. When I got back to Sweden I didn't study very hard in English the last two years of the upper secondary High school. I did a few writing-assignments here, which I thought turned out really good. I also have some unfinished short-stories lurking in the depths of my computer. When it comes to my abilities in spoken English, I think I have a very good understanding of how different words are pronounced, but I still have some problems with certain sounds; as in the buzzing "z"-sound and in the "th"-combination. I need to practise my talking skills a lot in the sense of coming up with the correct words for the feeling I want to convey or the point I want to make. I'm also used to Swedish slang and find it hard to translate certain expressions that I feel defines part of my person. This makes me feel awkward when I speak English.
EE547	0	﻿ "Gotta get grammar". English is for me a way of communicating with a foreigner. Bringing two worlds together by mutual comprehension gives a satisfaction out of the ordinary. I urge to understand, I urge to be understood. Somewhere in the background lurking are some tricky clause-elements just waiting to cause a stir. I am well aware of my main weekness after one week of intense grammar studies. Most of it is not at all new to me, which leaves me trying to figure out where I once got the knowledge. To be honest, I can not remember one single time where me and my classmate Emma had an instructive grammarsession. Our upper-secondary English teacher instead focused the lessons on current events, like in the BBC-world news broadcast. The type of subjects, for instance cloning, new tecnology, elections, always had the outcome of (to say the least) wild discus-sions. One got engaged whether you wanted or not. Like many others I belive I experienced the English classes to be the least frightful ones among heavily weighing nature-science subjects. Therefore, in a relaxed non-pressuring environment I openmindedly enjoyed my language studies. Graduated an free as a bird I decided to walk the same path as several of my fellownature. Illegally, with a bag of expectations and a skibag, I went overseas. Foremost to ski the Colorado "Rockies", next to broaden my vocabulary and last, sad to say, to work as a nanny. With a touristvisa for six months I knew I would need preperation and a good portion of luck. The whole flight over there I practiced what I would answer the immigrant interrogator, I am (was...) a very poor lier even in my mother tounge. Never have I been so nervous. I can't recapture one phrase I uttered, yet my fake Colgate-smile has forever engraved itself on my memory. Wait, perhaps I did finish of with a "-Thank you and have a nice day!"... Well the custom officer was the first in a long line of people with whom I would talk to. I soon discovered how some Americans have a way of socializing with you. It doesn't matter if you, for a start, show no interest whatsoever. In the beginning I wasn't that thrilled ending up in a chairlift with three talkative Americans. It did not take long though before I ruthlessly threw myself into conversations. The chairlift-dialogue did get sort of old after a while, so sometimes I spiced them up with downright lies (for the good cause of broadening my vocabulary). Along the way my speach and communicating skills improved remarkably, but on the other hand I fear my spellig and grammar mostly got damaged. It is one thing to read some books and magazines in English, but my writing for the last couple of years easily sum up to a couple of letters and e-mails. The lack of productive writing and no constructive index finger pointing out my way leaves me in a vaccum. How good/bad am I? Clarification in the matter will not linger...$$$﻿This essay is about my strengths and weaknesses considering writing, reading, listening and speaking English. My friends whom I went to the gymnasium with all said:- English, only English? Then you will have a lot of spare time won't you? You already know everything about English. But this English course contains so much more than you are used to from the gymnasium. At the gymnasium we never even discussed the fact that we might have weaknesses. But if there is something that I've learned from this essay it's that everybody has weaknesses and that you are never through with learning a language. I have always considered writing the part of the English language that I know best. I love to form sentences in English and I have never had any difficulties regarding writing, My strengths are that I have a good word suppliant and I don't make many grammar errors when I write. I also like to think that I use a fluent language. But I've discovered that since I left the gymnasium, two years ago, I've lost a lot of my skills and I don't spell as good as I used to. So I guess you could say that one of my weaknesses is the lack of practise or the lack of self-discipline to keep my writing fluent. Another weakness is that I am not very good at explaining grammatical rules in English. I usually know the consequences of them, but I can't actually explain them. I also love reading in English, because it has another flow of language than Swedish does. I can almost always understand the context of the books, even if there are words that I don't understand and once I start to read an English book I start to think in English and I soon forget that I'm actually reading a foreign book because I get so caught up in it. Something that I could improve about my reading is underlining the words that I don't know and look them up so that I will have a better vocabulary and understand all the words in the book and not just the context. I've always been interested in listening to the English language, because I like the sound of it. When I was about 8-10 years old and I wasn't allowed to stay up and watch a movie, a movie where they spoke English that is, I would lie in my room and listen to the sound of the television and I was amazed that I didn't need the Swedish translation, I actually understood what they were saying in English. This is something that I really think has helped improve my listening skills and my knowledge of words because you learn a lot of new words when you are trying to make out sentences by listening to the TV. I think one of my strengths is that I have had so much practising with both listening and speaking English, because my father is from Hungary so I have to speak English with my cousins, and I think that the best way of learning both how to listen and how to speak is to practise the language frequently When it comes to speaking my weaknesses are that sometimes I don't think that I speak as well in English as I could. That is when someone stops me in the street and asks:-can you please tell me where the nearest restaurant is? I tend to get a bit shocked and even if I know that I could answer with a perfectly good English sentence, my answer often sounds something like: -over there! But that is mostly when I'm caught of guard otherwise I think that my spoken English is rather good actually. I can always find some word to express what I mean or how I feel. But the greatest one of my strengths is the fact that I love the English language in every way. And it gives me great pleasure to take this course because I am very eager to regain and improve the skills that I once had, and I will, I am certain of it.
EE545	0	﻿ Weaknesses and strengths, a background. y English education started in the fourth grade, with the standard read and writes exercises. At this point I hadn't even learned to read that well in Swedish yet. So as predicted I started to lag behind. I did not do the words that were given in homework nor did I prepare that much for the exams. If it weren't for my friend and his big brother, which both loved English movies and songs, I would have given up English as a lost cause. Every time that I went to their house I was bombarded by English, if it wasn't on the Television it came from the stereo. They were always talking or singing along. So at the lessons I tried to keep up, even though I thought it was boring. It wasn't until when I started the Gymnasium that I began to see the point in learning English. Our new English teacher was a sweet old lady who keep on discipline but had some new ways of teaching. We watched short news flashes, and had to explain what it was about, we got to read books and write short essays about them, we had small group discussions, which she would sit in on. We did lots of fun word games and other stuff. At the same time I made a new acquaintance, a school friend who loved to read English Fantasy and Science fiction. He loaned me some books I read them and then I was hooked. So I started to read English literature and have done so ever after. So the consequence of all this is that I am real good at understanding the context in writings, even though I might not understand every word in it. I tried to look up words in my dictionary, but I wanted to find out what was going to happen in the books, so I started to use the dictionary less and less. At one time I was going to read a book in Swedish and it took almost 30 pages before I got into reading and thinking in Swedish. It is always better to read in the original language. My present vocabulary isn't that big and varying. When I'm writing I often know that I want another word, but I can't quite specify the word I want, so I have to settle with a similar word than the one I want instead. It also happens that I know what word I want, but I'm not sure how to spell it, in those instances I also write a similar word that I know how to spell to. So what happens then is that I can't make my meaning perfectly clear and I get a little frustrated, but that I'm used to. Also due to my unusual interests I have a little strange vocabulary, which contain seldom used words, and some old English words. When I write I try to stay with British English, but as almost all media that I consume is American English, my English tend to switch between British and American. Which can be annoying, but hopefully not disturbing. When it comes to listening I have a slight disadvantage. I have a small hearing problem that is only noticeable when people talk fast, may it be English or Swedish it doesn't matter, the words float together and I have trouble hearing. If I hear dialects then I have trouble in the beginning until I understand their patois, and that can take awhile. Standard English is easiest, both British and American. People who talk quiet are also difficult, because they tend to speak quieter and quieter. But as I said normal speaking people usually aren't a problem as long as they speak in normal tone or start speaking in technical terms. Speaking has always been difficult for me. I rather listen than speak in a conversation. I really like listening. I only speak when I believe I have something to contribute with or when I must. I don't like speaking to strange people, but I do it when I must. You can't live in a society without speaking. I have problems with the lisping sounds in English and long complicated words are a nightmare. If I have to repeat myself I usually mispronounce them the second time, get flustered and then I have to start over again. But I know that speaking is important in learning a language so I speak with the foreign exchange students that are members in my Student Nation. It is good practice, both verbally and socially.$$$﻿So, this is it. This is the moment when I have to confess all my previous errors. The moment to blame my teachers and to depict myself as an innocent bystander. The moment to tell the world how lousy I am at english. There is an old prayer whom I think describes my way to the english language quite well. From gholies and ghosties... Homework... Homework is Gods way of punishing children! I have never made any homework in my entire life! Oh, maybe one or two times, but that is all. I guess it is my way of telling the world that "this is my life and I am going to make the best out of it". I can asure you that homework not is the best way of entertaining yourself! And longleggedy beasties... Teachers, I have a theory about teachers. They are an alien race from outer space who lives of the agony of small, and not so small children. aybe not all of them, some teachers must be real life humans who likes teaching the errors of humanity to new generations. I can not decide if I like the first or the second group less than the other. I have had one good english teacher, the rest of them were quite bad. We had to correct their pronunciation, their ideas about teaching (reading a chapter from the englishbook and giving us homework) and their bad breath. Teachers should not be permitted to drink coffe before classes! And things that go bump in the night... All my friends are better at english than I am. My boyfriend have a bigger vocabulary then most englishmen, so does our best friend, I do not. I don't like being second best, or third, or fourth, so why bother? Good Lord deliver me Now you understand that it not is my fault that I am not that good at english, right? If you still holds me responsible for my shortcomings read everything from the beginning again till you have reached enlightenment. Othervise you might continue reading. No more prayers aybe the reason for me passing english in secondary school was that I am very good at understanding spoken and written english. It is easy finding the context of a sentence even though I don't know the meaning of every word. And it is way easier in spoken then in written english, and when I can see the person speaking then not. I guess that this is true for everyone. Reading english is easy, but not fun. It is allmost as fun as if reading a book about chemistry, a lot of text but nothing interresting, no feeling, no soul, just booring. There are a lot of soulless books out there, and most of them are written in english... but as soon as they get translated to swedish the translator finds a soul for allmost every book. I guess swedish translators are the greatest wizards on earth! But grammar... Is very hard to learn... This is where my knowledge about english is nonexistent. I write and says what I feel is right, not what I know is right, and my feeling for english is not so good. This, and my lousy vocabulary is the reason why I hate writing in english. I can never get anything the way I want it to be:(, and only getting the second best is most of the time not an option. And I really loves to write, so why should I write in a language I hardly knows? But still, if I never practise I will never get any better, and I really needs to get better. And if I get better my nightmares might disapear, all of them, except the things that go bump in the night... I will have to learn to coexist with them. Now you know, I hardly know english at all, (and it is not my fault!)
EE346	0	﻿English, my English! How do I feel when I listen, when I read, when I speak and when I write? That is a difficult question. English is not my mother tongue so of course I feel a little bit awkward towards the English language, when I have not for example, written anything in English for almost two years. Well I have written a few letters to a friend in Israel but they do not exactly improve my English. However, down below I will explain how I feel about my English right now and assess my strengths and weaknesses. Listening is what I do all the time. I listen to music, in English of course, radioprograms, television etc. I like to listen to the English language. It is beautiful and I think it is more nuanced than for example Swedish. Sometimes I feel it is easier to express exactly what I mean in English rather than in Swedish. Listening is one of my stronger sides and I think my understanding is quite good too and maybe that is why I like it. But of course I like speaking even better. For me it is more to speak or not to speak rather than to be or not to be. I speak all the time, sometimes I wish I could keep quiet, but I like it so there is no difference if the language is English, Hebrew, German, Russian or Swedish. I am not embarressed of doing grammatical faults but I prefer not to. That is one of the reasons why I am becoming a teacher. I want to learn and then I want to help those who want to learn. Well, those who want to learn, I will be a teacher in the Swedish senior level so I guess my job will be more like making the language interesting, which it is, and make them understand how important it is to know other languages. For example how languages can prevent problems. When it comes to reading I have not read much in English the last two years. I do not know why because I like it and sometimes I prefer it but when you study another language course in the university you do not really have the time. I studied Hebrew last year and that took all of my time. The good thing though was that the course was English-Hebrew based instead of Swedish-Hebrew. The litterature was of course in Hebrew but the dictionary was in English. That was interesting and it made me realize some of the difficulties with languages and that it sometimes is very easy to misunderstand the meaning of words. Two and a half years ago I was in Israel and there I read quite a lot, which is obvious because I had the time. The lifestyle there is totally different from ours, much slower and more comfortable. I read both books and papers, mostly the Jerusalem Post. Unfortunately the language I read is not the one I heard or practised so I do not think that I have had any use of my reading there. I know that it is very important to read a lot if I am going to improve my vocabulary and my writing which are my weak sides. Therefore it is good that the litterature course continues during the whole term. Well, I have already written that I am not so good in writing and I really hope that this writing course will help me to at least feel more comfortable with it. In upper secondary school we did not write anything. If we had read a book or a text or had seen a film we discussed it instead of writing a review. Therefore I have no experience in writing essays or anything similar. I am certain that this course will help me and give me the right directions to be a good English teacher. I am sure that during this A-course I will develop my English and I am really looking forward to this. English is fun and to understand that you have to have an interest and I have.$$$﻿In the secondary school I hated English lessons. They were always the same; glossary tests, reading a chapter aloud from the book and maybe some grammatics. Not hard work actually, but I didn't like it anyway. Sometimes we had to discuss openly in the classroom, and it was that part I didn't like, almost hated. y teacher in the 7:th till 9:th grade had made himself a very easy way to get off his teaching lightly. Mostly he just let us see some TV-programs in English. Preferably Mr Bean. Maybe we didn't learn to much about grammar and so on, but who cared? We loved the English lessons, of course. It wasn't until secondary school I noticed that my English weren't the best. I felt ashamed and didn't wanted to speak or do anything that showed my lack of knowledge. All tests turned out bad, and I who had very good grades in almost all of the other subjects found out that I strongly disliked English. If you're bad at something and don't like it (actually just because you're bad in it, I suppose) you won't improve, no matter how much your English teacher strains you and herself. She also taught Swedish, where I was one of the best, so she couldn't understand why I was such a disaster in English. Anyway, I survived secondary school, consequently avoiding speaking and reading English unless I really had to. Right after school I went to study biology at the university. Suddenly every course book was written in English, and there were no way you could shirk. It was simple: if you didn't understood the English, you wouldn't understand the course which in turn meant a failed exam. So I had to deal with my dislike for English. My first book "Chemistry" of a thousand pages ought to be finished within ten weeks. At first I had to consult my dictionary for every second word, and it took me a very, very long time. After a while I learned that I didn't needed to understand every single word. A few books later I found out that the English language wasn't that bad after all. Now, when I'm in my third year and have a lot of books behind me the reading isn't any big problem any more. As I mentioned above, I never liked speaking English, I really hated it in school. But the university indirectly helped me out here too. I met a couple of exchange-students. They were even worse in English than I was, but they didn't care! They just carried on talking and if we Swedes didn't understood what they were saying, which happened frequently in the beginning, they just tried with body language. We all had a lot of fun, and at the same time I discovered that they didn't care at all about my bad grammar or if I pronounced something in an incorrect way. They understood what I was saying anyway, and was pleased with it. That, I can tell you, was a relief! The English language now began to interest me. I've already discovered that I needed to improve, but now I actually wanted to learn more and make improvements. The literature on the biology courses helped me a lot with the understanding of texts, but they didn't taught grammar or pronunciation. I decided to take this English course. Listening is something I haven't trained since school and I have always thought that I was bad at that too. But after visiting the first lectures I discovered that I actually - without problems - did understood what the lecturers were talking about. The speaking is still my worst skill. I often feel uncomfortable and insecure. But that's what I'm here for, to change it! I always liked writing - in Swedish of course. It's so easy in Swedish; I have a feeling for which sentence that sounds right and which doesn't, but in English I don't have that little voice in my head. I've always found grammar very boring, and only remembered what I needed a short while to pass the tests. That's one of the things that I now regret. Still I think it's a lot of fun to create an essay.
EE072	0	﻿ Learning English at the Age of Six Younger Swedish school- children are not capable of understanding the English that surrounds them, unless they have a linguistic instinct and a large amount of interest or have very ambitious parents. The Swedish schools do not encourage English learning until grade four, when it becomes one of the basic subjects. This is something to be taken seriously. Children have the right to know some English, much earlier than what is the case today. Nowadays, Swedish children are exposed to the English language long before they begin learning it in school. Television-cartoons and films, computer-games, pop-music, Poke'mon-cards and all sorts of toy-instructions are in English. They also meet English-speaking persons more often than older generations. Therefore, it is obvious that our children definitely have a need for English, at least passively, long before they learn the language in school. The Swedish curriculum suggests that the schools teach English in a way that they can make use of the child's own interests and curiosity, such as pictures, music, moving around and creativity. There is not a set age, when the schools are obliged to start the English education. Most schools however do not begin properly until grade three or four. I would say that most teachers are not in the position to make use of their pupils' interests, since the teaching often starts in grade four. At the age of ten, pupils already have to know some basic English to manage to use their interests in language-learning. Therefore, it would be much better to introduce English as early as at the age of six. Then teachers and pupils can make use of the supply of English and American material for pre-school children, such as books, games, tapes and films. Consequently, one obtains interested pupils who practise English just because it is so much fun. To enjoy the subject is the best start in the process of learning a new language. Having received a keen interest in English, children can more easily get interested also inother cultures. They understand that Sweden is one small part of our big world and that new languages are nothing strange. Many teachers and parents think that children should learn one language at a time. They are afraid that they will get confused when they are introduced to English at the age of six. Their worries are certainly understandable, but many children are the proof that this is not the case. They are brought up in a bilingual environment, and they learn both languages. My brother in law's daughter, who is three years old, speaks Swedish like a four year old. She understands English and is in the state of beginning to use it actively. She is also surrounded by Arabic. At the age of three she has reached the point where she is able to distinguish the three languages and translate from English to Swedish when her both grandmothers talk to each other. She has a good ear for languages and her parents are indeed very much aware of the fact that it is important to work actively with giving their daughter all three languages. Not all children have this exclusive background, but at the age of six most Swedish children have such a good knowledge in Swedish that there is nothing dangerous in introducing a new language. Actually, at the age of six, children are very receptive to new languages, and they are not afraid of doing mistakes, like in pronunciation. Some persons concerned with the preservation of the purity of Swedish want to protect our mother tongue from English influences. They want to keep it as it is. Swedish has however already been under the influence of several languages e.g. French and German. these influences are connected to our history. So Swedish is constantly evolving. Accordingly, we can never protect our language fully from the influences of other languages, but early English-learning is not the cause of the changing of the Swedish language. Instead this can raise awareness about distinguishing the two languages and it may lead to a deeper sense for the mother tongue. Applying my thoughts right into the teaching-system of today will probably not work. We need teachers comfortable with speaking English. A professional attitude is of importance. Working with younger pupils should demand almost as long university education as working with older ones. Although the main thing is of course that the teacher's knowledge is applicable to younger children. Finally, I am looking forward to see the next generation having confidence in using English in Sweden or abroad earlier than our generation, and having the possibility to apply English to their interests. This can be the truth if we begin the English learning at the age of six.$$$﻿ Shorter working hours - Higher quality of life for everyone We live in a time, when most people are pressed for short of time. Many of us, I am sure, feel like they are running in a treadmill that never stops. My suggestion to solve this problem is a change-over from an eight-hour working day to a six-hour day. I believe that such change is relatively easy done. All that it takes is some schedulechanges, and maybe a slightly different distribution of the work. I am sure that a shortening of the working hours would give many advantages, both to society and to the individual. As a result of the shorter working hours, the individual will have more spare time, to do whatever he wants. For example, if he has a family he can spend more time with the children, who can get more help with their homework. And i am sure that everyone who has children, feel that they never have as much time to just sit down and talk to them as they would like. People will also get time to exercise their hobbies. I believe that a lot of people feel that they do not have time to do the things they really want to do. They keep thinking: "I will do it later, when I get time ". Doing things you really like to do is, as we all know, an important part of life. With the introduction of a six-hour working day, we will get more spare time and a higher quality of life for everyone. y second argument for a shorter work week is that it will lead to an increased number of vacant jobs, which means that many of the unemployed will get a job. That means that it will be a more fair division of labour and in a time when so many are unemployed, I think that it is only fair that we share the burden of work. Because just as well as it can be hard to find time when you have a full time job, it can be tough to be unemployed, with a constant lack of money and a feeling of being unneeded. There is no doubt that getting a job leads to a higher self-esteem and a higher quality of life. If we can attain this just by shortening the work, I can see no reason why we should not do it. y third argument for shorter working hours is that the number of repetitive strain injuries will be reduced. That will lead to fewer certificates of illness, which will be good, both for the companies and for the individual. The companies will save money, because they will not have to hire so many stand-ins. Furthermore, the companies will become less vulnerable because the staffs will be larger, and it will be easier for them to cover up for someone missing because of illness. The individual will probably get a fuller, healthier old age, if the body is not jaded. The queues to surgical operations, on for example hip joints, will be shortened. And that is, of course, a major advantage for society in general. Shorter queues in the medical service is, as we all know, a goal for all the political parties. I know that this labour market measure has been up to discussion several times, at least here in Sweden. Strangely enough, it has not come to a decision yet, but I am sure that it will happen soon. The advantages are, as anyone must understand, so overwhelming, that everybody must see that shorter working hours are inevitable in the future. Let us just hope that everybody involved in decision-making will soon make the only right decision on this issue.
EE073	1	﻿ Television can be a big resource as long as we use it right The question of how television affects our lives touches both the uses and the abuses of television. After first showing you the background to this debate, I will tell you about both sides and my opinion of how you can control the abuses and instead turn them into uses of television. First I would like to describe the difference between television's influence previously and currently. Earlier television reflected and returned outer reality. Television today is in contrast more like a reality of its own right. This reality reaches and forms us wherever we are. The recent tragic happenings in USA illustrate this fact very clearly. Furthermore, all the TV-series that are running in most countries is a good example of the change of television's position in society. Series where real people are forced to act on the television's conditions, would have been out of the question earlier. For this reason the series reflects an actual change. TV is no more an object which we can stand beside and look at, instead we have become TV's objects. It is owing to this that I think it is important to give the background to why we are discussing this matter at all. Nobody would be wondering about the uses or abuses of television if this change of TV's influence had not taken place. As a result of this change has television become the most real thing we have, accordingly to that TV is so usual and obvious nowadays. You can like TV or not, but you cannot any longer take it out of our lives. Now when I have described the source to this discussion I am going to give my reflections. To begin with, most of us are in some way involved in television's language. We communicate with each other by talking about TV-shows and the specific happenings in them. Television is as well as weather a very ordinary topic that people with no relation to each other can discuss without any fear of making any serious mistake. Therefore TV is a medium which breaks all the barriers between people with cultural and social differences. Television is moreover a indispensable source which provides us with many elementary facts. It is one of the most important ways for people to know about all the current situations in the rest of the world. TV can also be educational in many ways, especially for the children as long as somebody adult is present and responsible of what the children are watching. Television has of course not just good sides. It can inspire people to choose completely wrong directions in their lives, it can create opinions which are real dangerous to society. TV can also give people inspiration to carry out actions that otherwise would stay in their imaginations. In addition to all this, can the children learn irrelevant things. They can also start to think that the TV-behaviour is the right form of behaviour and that the actions on TV are justifiable. It is always easy to pick or point out the negative aspects in every medium or idea, but in this case I think it is just as easy to tell how to avoid these negative developments. Concerning the children, the answer is as I mentioned above. The adults have to take their responsibility and have the children's TV-habits under attention. And in that way turn their watching to be something educational rather than something destructive. In all the other issues I just mentioned as negative I believe that the solution is named selection. In society today, I think that every individual is equipped with a common sense and an ability to be selective. So this ability together with the common sense should lead to that people would avoid useless shows or series, which neither are educational or giving any information of importance. Unfortunately this is still just a utopia. And it will not be easy to convince everybody of the fact that TV is a positive element if you just choose programs after some consideration. Television has undoubtedly developed to become a big part of our lives. And I cannot see any reason for why it will not be the same in the future. Therefore is it of great relevance that everybody who dislike TV must notice how much it offers and how easy it is to avoid the junk-parts. But it is even more important that TV stays as a part of our lives instead of controlling our lives.$$$﻿ Give the elderly a decent treatment The whole idea of having the elderly at their respective families instead of having them at a home for the aged is absurd. Although if the two alternatives may give an equal amount of arguments I can't see why there can be any doubt of which side to take in comparison of the two options. To begin with, who in each family should be responsible of taking care of that the elder will be getting the right medicine at the right moment. On the other hand, you can always educate people in general medicine. But, you will never reach the same trust like you do if a real nurse is taking care of it. Moreover, accidents come whether you want them or not. And in situations of that kind you can count on a proper behaviour when it comes to solving it, if your elder is surrounded by professionals instead of amateurs. Secondly, how can a family have a twenty-four hours control as you have in state care. Of course, it is just to split the hours between the familymembers and go on with this schedule every week. As a result of this solution comes the inevitable question of how much each familymember are willing to sacrifice to secure this twenty-four hours control. You can't guarantee that everyone always will be able, or want to follow a schedule like that. In contrast, if you just use persons who are educated and trained for a specific task, they will do all that is required from them. Because why would they otherwise choose it as their profession. Therefore it would be wrong to even think that a family can be as reliable as a home for the aged. Relationship is indeed something valuable, but it is simply not just enough in this issue. In addition to how it will be for the familymembers to give up a certain bit of their spare-time to manage to solve it, you must look on the other side of the coin. No one can possibly come and say that any elder, who has been brought up to get things done, would like an situation where he or she would be a burden instead of an asset for the family. The elderly will with no doubt feel that they are limiting the other familymembers wills to do stuff which they get more satisfaction from, when they have to be stuck at home watching them instead. These two statements may assume to that any kind if sickness has to be involved to create this understanding. But, in fact that is not necessary at all. Just the thing that the elderly can't be home alone even though that they are in great condition is enough to describe why it is like that. For who can you blame if something happens to your old relative when you or someone else not are present. This fact is just another thing you can avoid if you leave it to the professionals. Next problem which will appear if we let the elderly become a family matter is unemployment. Homes for the aged is one of the largest working places in our current society. Because if the families should look after the elderly they can't hire anyone else to do it for them. And then there won't be any similar place to go to for all the people who are working at any home for the aged at the moment. For this reason they won't be out of options but it is not easy to find something else to do just like that. Everyone will not have the will or the potential, which is demand if they want to avoid unemployment. Thus, the elderly deserves to feel that they can contribute with something and that they fill a function without interfering some other person. The elderly must get good treatment at any time and they should feel confident that they are in safe hands if something happens to them. This is not an illusion, it is how the reality should look like when everyone reaches an higher age. But it will just be an illusion if the elderly becomes a family matter.
EE070	0	﻿y relationship to English has generally been about talking and listening. It was when I first came to read at KOMVUX I actually first started to do the writhing and reading. At compulsory school it was just boring, hard work and dull teachers, who actually made the lessons quit boring. Although we had stand-in teachers from time to time, they made the lessons more interesting. It was quite fun at school at those occasions. When I left the Compulsory school I guess I knew that much English I could make me understood if ever necessary. I didn't go to Upper secondary school after Compulsory school; I started to work instead. My English was in a deep sleep through the years until I decided to start working in the Swedish merchant navy. It was the first time I actually had the opportunity to practice my school English. I improved my English during the years at sea, but only when it comes to talking and listening. I can't say that my vocabulary very big. I guess I stick to the words I'm familiar with. But don't we all Do that from time to time. Hopefully we don't make to many mistakes then. All through the years at sea I did never reflected about that I could read an English book to improve my English. I don't think we even had any English books on board. Well if we did I didn't look for them. After spending seven years at sea I decided to change career and went to a Folk high school to get an Upper secondary school competence. During my year at the Folk high school I had English at the schedule. As I can remember it we didn't do much reading or writing. It was more off talking and listening comprehension. This year I learned one thing, as I never reflected over before, the different between British English and American English. It was mainly because we first had an American teacher who taught us the American way of speaking. The next semester we got a Swedish teacher who preferred the B.E. He had a hard time to teach us the British pronunciation. At this very day I'm rather convinced that I still have a mix of both B.E and A.E. After my year at the Folk high school the life went on ashore. One day I felt it was time to do something about my situation as an unemployed and I went to KOMVUX to, ones again, get an Upper secondary school competence. The other one from the Folk high school was too old. At KOMVUX, for the first time, I got in touch with the written word in book form. Well that's not really true, I have had tried to read a novel before but I gave it up before finishing it. This time I had to finish it and review it to the class. From the beginning it was hard work but I learned to enjoy it, and I still do. But I don't read that much English literature I must admit. During the English course at KOMVUX we had to hand in essays as well. From a start I had no bigger problems with that but at the B-level I had a teacher who wanted us to hand in essay after essay about different subjects and so I did. My essays was always marked whit red all over, but I never got any explanation about all the mistakes I did, so I could chance them It went from enjoy writing to something I disliked. After KOMVUX I haven't been writing one word until this very moment. And I still have the problem when it comes to writing English as you obvious can see And I'm still unsecured when it comes to writing, thanks to my teacher at B-level at KOMVUX Now when I look back at my evaluation about my English all through the years I realise I could have improved my English by reading and writing more than I have done, but I didn't. I actually didn't know I was going to become a teacher one year ago, but now I'm here and I haven't got cold feet yet.$$$﻿ The Steam of Courage According to Catholic doctrine, to think evil towards others is punishable. But in Ellen's case it is quite understandable and acceptable when she produces such horrible plans about her family, relatives and even her surroundings. She did not get any moral support from her father, which was her prime protector. Nevertheless, as we go on further reading the literary history, we will encounter all sorts of actions that Ellen is bound to react emotionally and sensibly. Her ideas were gorgeous, brilliant and enormously great, that she succeeded in the end. Ellen Foster is from childhood surrounded and dominated by the coarse-grained dead or crazy people, but according to her she figured out that she was pretty good considering the rest of her family. Sometimes it is hard to believe that it happens to her. She is the pacifier in her family. She was very strong and determined what she wanted to do. She tried her utmost best to save her mother from taking an overdose pills. She said to her "vomit them up mama, I will stick my finger down your throat and you can vomit them up. I got her suitcase in my hand and I carry it to the bedroom. What can I do but go and reach the tall things for her. I help her get herself laid in the bed and then I slide in beside her. I will stay her with you, just for a nap. I get up and go in there and tell him (her father) to get up that folks got to come in here and do their business. (P. 5) It is really excruciating indeed on her part to take care of two old grown up people who act like children which are supposedly her mentors. But here it is the other way around. She does the chores which are meant for her parents, just to please and satisfy them. There has been a systematic effort and braveness in her which precisely the mechanism to remedy her turbulence life. When she lived with her grandmother she did not expect that she would be working in the field without being paid, just like the black people. But even her grandmother treated her like a slave she was not an ill-regulated little girl. She showed respect and kindness in spite of her grandmother's rudeness. She worked on the field under the heat of the sun. Al-though she gets sick from the start because she is not used to do such things when she lives together with her parents. A passage that strengthen her braveness." I had to sit down and every time I tried to stand up I just had to sit back down. I can hardly stands it my own hot self. The next morning I got straw hat out of the garden shed and wore it all day. I felt cooler all over and did not get sick anymore. While I worked I mainly counted in my head or recited the poems I knew good to myself. You can keep time with the hoe chopping around a plant. By July I was like a boy. When I started out both my hands were a red blister but then I toughened up good." Nevertheless, she has the courage to be funny, which maybe one of some reason why Starletta and her new mama liked her. Some passages that fortifies her funny traits. "She could not help getting sick but nobody made her marry him. You see when she was my size she had romantic fever I think it is called and since then she has not had a good heart." (p. 3) "I would go off by myself and imagine turning my buddy Starletta loose in here. She could have a rampage in one room and out the other, or maybe I will invite the whole family that eats off records. They can visit while you are at the beauty parlor I thought and I felt better to imagine it all." (p 62-3) Unconciously she thinks of funny things just to tease and let her grandmother realize that those collectibles are not so important in life. Ellen is longing for love attention and affection from her grandmother but unfortunately she did not get them. Beyond Ellen's limitations she conquers the misty and steamy moment inher life. She coped with the unendearment sequence that made her the luminary in the atory. And considering the fact that she confines herself to such miserable surroundings still she manages to be thoughtful, affectionate and considerate her ralatives and others, like Dora, Nadine, Starletta, her new mama and her grandmother. Considerate when she assisted her sich mother, grandmother. Very thoughtful to Dora and Nadine, when she drew cats for them as christmaspresents. Very affectionate to Starletta and to her new mama. She could not hardly wait not telling her new mama about Starletta coming to visit her on weekends so that they could play and spend together. "Come on and crawl up here and rest with me for while. This is the way I always do. Well I came to your house because I like you so much." (P 124)
EE475	1	﻿ MORE MEN ARE NEEDED IN THE CHILD-CARE SYSTEM When I am writing this, it is the beginning of March 1999 and in one of the cities of Sweden, something terrible has happened, something that fills the whole country with horror. A twenty-two year old man who was working as a child-minder, has during a few years, abused several children sexually and also produced an enormous amount of child pornographic material. Of course, what everybody is asking themselves right now is; what kind of a sick creature is capable to do something like that? As always after such a scandal, people start to question the motives of the men working with child-care. Worried mothers might wonder if he really has to touch the children that much and what are his intentions of following them to the bathroom? I have understood, after reading some interviews in the morning papers, that many of the men working at the day-care centers today are feeling observed by suspicious eyes, as if there would be something abnormal of being a man working with children. I find attitudes like that to be in most cases absolutely unfounded and instead I do believe that it is very important to make a greater number of men start working in the child-care system. Here below I will give an account of my main arguments for thinking so. Today, the overwhelming majority, or 95 percent, of the people working with childcare in Sweden are women. This are usually quite low-paid jobs and I do believe that there is a connection between that and the fact that it is a work sector dominated by women. Sweden is said to be one of the most equal countries in the world, but still typical female jobs, like nursing and pree-scool teaching are paid less than typical male jobs. Why is this then? I would suggest that it depends much on the way it traditionally have been; the women were staying at home, taking care of the children while the men were working. Perhaps the women working in the child-care system today too easily have accepted being low-paid, just because they traditionally have been taking care of the children without being paid at all. Since most politicians and employers historically also have been men, they might have been favouring occupations dominated by their own sex. I am convinced that if more men were working in the child-care system, it would soon result in demands for higher wages and would in a long term view create a more equal working situation. I find the child-care system to be an essential part of our society and therefore I feel that it is of great importance that the jobs are attractive for well-educated people. I do believe that more men employed would make the politicians improve the situation sooner. y second main argument is that I believe all children need reliable men in their every-day environment. Especially today, when there are so many children having an absent father, living with a single mother. I have no doubt that the majority of single mothers are doing a brilliant job, but they cannot be a father as well as a mother. Of course no man can replace a child's real father, but I am convinced that having good male role models around, help children in their own development and in future relationships. A better balance between the number of men and women working at the day-care centers would make the children grow up and see that childcare is not a duty reserved only for women, which would lead to children growing up with more equal attitudes. The debate lately about incest and pedophils has resulted in people becoming suspicious and several cases of suspected incest have been brought up both by media and in court. I believe a lot of people find it difficult to decide what is normal behaviour and what is not. Incest is one of the worst crimes anybody can commit and naturally we should all continue to be attentive if we have the slightest suspicion of a child being abused. What we can not do is allowing these suspicions to go too far, after all most men would not dream about hurting a child. I claim that more men are needed in the child-care system to show that it is perfectly normal for men to take care of children and that there is nothing perverse or strange about it. More men working as child-minders would probably make it easier to recognize abnormal behaviour and help us not to mix it with truly innocent contact. The few monsters abusing children should not be allowed to lay guilt on all men and scare them from working with and taking care of children.$$$﻿I can still remember the fascination I felt when I at the age of nine years was confronted with this new subject in school - English! There was a kind of mysterious glow around it; a completely different language, full with new sounds, new words and still, you knew that in a foreign country, far away from Sweden, people were actually talking like that all the time! I remember proudly bringing home my homework and practise with a loud voice: "yes", "no", "this is Spot, he is a dog". During my childhood, new English loan words were frequently used in the school yard, kabel TV came and practically drowned us in american soaps and even a small country girl like I had been at Mc Donald's. In many ways, I think, the English language came closer to us since you often heard it around you. Altogether, I have been studying English in school for nine years and thinking back about it now, it has all become a great blur. I don't remember when I learned what or why... Through the years I have had pretty good grades in English, but now I can't see why! Maybe because I was the nice girl who always handled her assignments in on time and usually spelled correctly. Or because I was one of the happy persons who had a certain intuition when it comes to languages, the kind of person who soon becomes very lazy of guessing right all the time. That is probably why I never got the highest grade in English, I found it too easy from the beginning and therefore I never worked hard enough in school. When I graduated from school my skills in grammar was not excellent at all, my way of speaking needed lots of training to be fluent and since my vocabulary was quite limited I sometimes found it a little bit hard to read and fully understand the content. However, when I graduated in 1997, the only thing I wanted to do was to go abroad to improve my language and stand on my own legs. Now, circumstances made me go to Belgium, where I had got a job, and I soon noticed that the Flamish parts of Belgium isn't a place where people tend to speak English very well, not the people I knew anyway. English was the language I used everyday at work but among the persons in my environment I was the best English speaker. I believe that was both good and bad for me. It certainly helped me to overcome my silly fear of making a fool of myself every time I opened my mouth and after some time I began to speak much more fluent. I'm afraid it also had the consequence of me becoming more careless with the way I was speaking, since nobody corrected my mistakes when I was wrong. I don't think that I actually improved my English much during my time in Belgium, but by using the language every day, I got a completely new confidence. In my job I met so many people of various nationalities and often there were stressed situations when I simply had to make myself understood quickly. Who cared about a small grammatic fault then? After some time though, I began to find my limited vocabulary quite frustrating and at the same time I had plans of leaving my job and go to England, where I hoped to improve my English more in a more effective way. My next destination was therefore London! Finally I was in an English-speaking environment and I enjoyed every minute in England's beautiful capital. It did not take long before I started to think and dream in English and the big change was that now I also constantly got new influences from the world around me. My new job was in a pub behind the bar. The first weeks there I had a rather difficult time getting used to the different accents around me and I always had to ask people please to repeat what they had just said. I felt hopelessly dumb for a couple of weeks and then, suddenly, like a miracle, I understood! I am convinced that working behind that bar, always hearing and taking part in various conversations was of a great use for my understanding of English. I think that the only way to develope a good listening ability is simply to train your ears in lively environments. While you are learning a language, the more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. At least I felt that way. I thought that I could handle every day conversations in a pretty smooth way, but still, there was so much missing for me. In intense discussions I very often felt that the tempo was to high for me, I could not put my opinions into words and express myself quick and clear enough. At breakfast time, when I was reading the morning paper I sometimes lost the content because of some words or expressions I did not quite understand. I found all those things very annoying! During my time in London I also attended a college course. When I was writing my essays I realized that my grammar skills left a lot to wish for and I know they still do! The problem is I think, that I trust my intuition about what sounds good too much, without really being aware of what I am doing and why. When I try to analyse the way I build up a sentence and in what ways I can improve it, I tend to stare myself blind at it and soon I don't know either in or out! I am positive that a wider knowledge of grammar will help me feeling more confident there. To sum up, I want to say that English is a language that lies very close to my heart. I enjoy very much hearing and speaking English and I love the sound of the different accents. I also think that English is so very useful in many aspects, it is a world language and it has so many synonym words which makes it easier to be exact and put your finger on what it is you want to say. It is also such a lively language, at least compared to Swedish. As I already have mentioned I think that my weaknesses lies in a vocabulary that is too limited and in insufficient knowledge of grammar. My strength is probably that I have quite easy to spell and that I am not afraid of trying to express myself, even when I risk being laughed at... Naturally I need lots and lots of practise, my good speaking skills for example, disappears very quickly when I don't use English regulary. I sincerely believe and hope that my time here at Uppsala university will give me a wider perspective on the language and that I will become a more qaulified user of it. Still, learning a language is a process that keeps going on during your whole life, isn't it!
EE075	1	﻿ The Americanisation in Sweden The trend in society that I have chosen to describe is the Americanisation in Sweden. We can all agree, more or less, that Sweden has been influenced by America. The Americanisation has occurred in some areas more than others. If we are in doubt if Sweden is Americanised or not, we can only imagine what it would be like in Sweden if we had imitated Russia as much as we have imitated America. It is almost unthinkable, but Sweden would then be a totally different country. Americanisation means that America has gained influence over Sweden in terms of culture and society. American ideas, values, food and companies are seen as something of high value in Sweden today. When we in Sweden look up to America we also start to imitate. An example of this is Halloween, which is an American celebration that has come to Sweden. It is celebrated on the Swedish "allhelgonadagen" in Sweden now because we have seen it in American movies and in TV- series and thought it was a funny tradition that suited us. However, it wouldn't be celebrated in Sweden unless American traditions weren't seen as something positive. Another example is the American hamburger chain McDonald's, which is currently establishing more and more restaurants all over Sweden. A lot of people are choosing McDonald's instead of trying local Swedish specialities, so McDonald's are winning on behalf of smaller specialised restaurants in Sweden. We are looking up to America and imitating Americans because USA is a leading nation in economy, media and also a political power. America is the dominating country in certain areas as movie production, television, and music. When we get interested in a culture we learn more and more about it and then we are influenced by it. We do see a lot of American movies and TV-series and also listen to American music. We also get interested in speaking English, out of economic and cultural interest. We need to know English because it is a global language. English is the language that is dominating in technology, international politics, diplomacy, finance, air traffic, IT, media, entertainment and so on. The variety that is taught in Swedish school is most of the time British English, but we hear American English all the time because of the American domination in media, so it is impossible for us here in Sweden not to mix the accents or speak more and more American English. When a language is often heard or spoken it is spreading ideas, because a language is a way of thinking. Americans stand for 70% of the English that is spoken in the world. On the other hand, some people don't see America as a prestigious country. In fact, some people among the highly educated or older in Sweden look down on American culture and it is devalued, because it is seen as cheap and not as good as European. Nevertheless, I think that it's safe to say that the majority of people are influenced by America even if not everyone is totally impressed. This essay was about the fact that America has influenced every day life in Sweden. This is because we look up to America mostly due to international economy and media. Because we value American things high we imitate them and like them.$$$﻿ Homosexual couples should have the right to be tried as adopting parents When I was younger I was against the proposal that homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children. I was opposed to it, just as Linden, because I was thinking about the children and the problems it will cause for them, in school and among their friends. Maybe I have become older and wiser now, but I also believe that society has changed to a more tolerant view of homosexuals. Now I can't see any major problems with a family constellation with two mothers or two fathers. They already exist, with or without difficulties, exactly as any "ordinary" family has. I also think that if we change the rules in our society there will be a change of what is seen as acceptable and the public norms. If we take steps towards a more tolerant society by allowing "gayadoptions", it will encourage people to be more open and proud of their sexuality, which is positive. It is not your sexual preferences that decide if you are a good parent or not. We should carefully examine other qualities such as ability to love and responsibility when we decide if someone is appropriate to adopt a child or not. And there is nothing that suggests that homosexuals and heterosexuals shouldn't be equal in these categories. It is our qualities as humans that are important, not what sexuality we have or what sex for that matters. The first argument that I will counter is the one that homosexuality and "gayadoptions" is supposed to be unnatural. Homosexuality has existed for as long as we know and it exists everywhere in nature, so I don't see what is so unnatural about it. We allow people with difficulties having children to have inseminations and hormones and all kinds of manipulations. There is hardly anyone that objects to these "unnatural" things. It is of course always difficult to decide where we should draw the line between what is allowed and what is not. When we think about what is right and what is wrong we must also consider the issue of discrimination. The doctors want to do everything in their power to help people and us ordinary people should also try to help each other and not discriminate each other for different reasons. Imagine growing up and realising that you can never have a baby just because you happen to be born homosexual. Being homosexual is not a choice you make. It is something that chooses you. And the issue that is at stake here is not concerning everyone's right to have a baby but concerning everyone's right to be tested if they are eligible adopting parents. Secondly, I have come across another heavy counter argument saying that children who are put up for adoption are often traumatised by earlier experience, and should therefore be treated in the best possible way, which is absolutely true. Some people argue that we should avoid further complications in adopted children's life by putting them in a family consisting of two fathers or two mothers and that children have the right to have one father and one mother when they come to Sweden. However, it is better to live in a homosexual family in Sweden than to live in the streets or in an orphanage. There are a huge number of children that would benefit from coming to Sweden. And it is far from every child that has a mother and a father in his/her life. Thirdly, to answer the objection that other countries won't allow their children to be adopted to Swedish gay families: Of course we won't force people to give their babies to homosexual couples when they are against it but I don't see that as a problem. We can control which baby goes to which family and I am sure that some people in some countries will allow their children to be adopted by gay parents. In places such as Iceland and California they have already consented that they could send children to gay couples. And if this proposal to allow "gayadoptions" goes through, there is nothing that implies that there will be a huge demand for babies from homosexual couples. In the beginning there will be few "gayadoptions" so there will surely be enough babies. A fourth counter argument that I will deal with asserts that there is no research saying that it isn't harmful for babies to be adopted by homosexual parents, and we shouldn't use babies as guinea pigs to experiment on. "Gayadoptions" is a new thing and for that reason there hasn't been much research in the subject. Nevertheless, we can study adopted children in Sweden and children living with two people of the same sex. We can get hold of much more information than they could when they first started adopting children from other countries, to Sweden. Briefly put: I used to think that the adopted children to gay parents would suffer because of their parents but now I think that the Swedish people are ready for this. A main reason to why I think "gayadoptions" are a good thing is the fact that there are so many children in the world that would have a better life if they were living in Sweden with homosexual parents, compared to the way they live their life now. Uppsala Nya Tidning, 13 February 2001 Thomas Linden says in his letter that homosexuality and homosexuals having children is something unnatural. He implies that adopted children to homosexual couples will suffer. Linden says that the man's role and the woman's role will be very confused within these families. Another problem is that other countries will not send children to Sweden if we will allow homosexuals to adopt children. In the end he turns towards the reader to ask: what do you think?
EE078	0	﻿ Let homosexual couples adopt children! In the Dagens Nyheter 99-09-27 there was an article that argued against homosexual couples having the right to adopt children. The arguments that were used concentrated on what was best for the child that was to be adopted, a viewpoint I completely agree with, but I found their arguments to be invalid. Firstly, that children shouldn't be adopted since they will have difficulties in their lives, if adopted by homosexual parents. Secondly, that legitimate adoptions to Sweden might decrease since the majority of the biological mothers or representatives for orphans don't want to give their child up for adoption to homosexual couples. Thirdly that there should be no more experimenting with the lives of children that are adopted. These arguments might seem valid when out of the context, but I will argue against this article in order to show that homosexual couples are not less suitable to be parents than heterosexual couples are. To begin with, it is argued that it is not right to let homosexual couples adopt children, since these children would go through hard times. It is not specified in the article what kind of problems and obstacles these children would encounter, but I believe that this argument concerns problems in society, such as mobbing or other kind of negative responses from society regarding the configuration of the family of the child. Nevertheless, every child can face hard times and problems in every kind of family, it doesn't have to be a family where the parents are homosexual. Joakim Anrell writes in the Internet magazine that it is an exaggeration to blame all the problems in a family on the fact that the parents are homosexual. He also points out that there is nothing that indicates that problems, when there are some, are caused by the child's parents being homosexual and not by some other factor. Furthermore, if it is in the child's best interest that society shouldn't put it in a situation where it can go through hard times how can then the adoption of coloured children be justified? They too can go through hard times and even be harassed, since there are racist opinions in Sweden today. Since it is clear that it is not only children that live with homosexual parents that can go through hard times, how can it then be used as an argument against adoption by homosexual parents? The second argument concerns what might happen if homosexual couples would be allowed to adopt children. It is argued that the chances of legitimate international adoptions to Sweden might decrease, since homosexual couples are not accepted as parents by the countries that give up children for adoption and the majority of the mothers or representatives for orphans don't want to give a child up for adoption by homosexual couples. It is important to keep up good relations with other countries, but it is equally important not to discriminate a minority that can and want's to help take care of the less fortunate children of the world. A solution to this problem, to both prevent a possible decrease in international adoptions and see too the best of the children by providing them with a good home and a loving family, could perhaps be accomplished by allowing homosexual couples a limited right to adopt children. This could be done in such a way that the persons that give up a child for adoption may decide whether they want the child to be adopted by hetero- or homosexual parents. The number of children given up for adoption by homosexual couples would of course be limited, but this way a few more children could get a good home. Perhaps the limitation wont prevent the countries from stopping adoptions to Sweden, but it would be an acceptable compromise, at least for the time being. This limitation could later be removed when society has accepted families that consist of homosexual parents. The third and final argument states that there should be no more experimenting with the lives of the children that are adopted. Since the argument isn't further developed it is hard to see what is meant by it. I assume that giving a child homosexual parents is what in this case is meant by experimenting. In a motion to the Swedish Parliament Andreas Carlgren writes that in a study conducted by the university of Gothenburg concerning children growing up with homosexual parents concluded that it is not the configuration of the family which affects the child most, instead it is how the children are raised and what kind of support they receive in society. This argument also suggests that it has been accepted to experiment with heterosexual parents - These have all been different individuals who have been investigated thoroughly before being allowed to adopt a child. There is no way of knowing what happened to those heterosexual families after a few years, perhaps they couldn't take care of the child properly or perhaps they became abusive, still the child and the parents were given a chance. Homosexuals are not even allowed to apply for adoption and be examined and I believe that that right should apply to everyone. Only this way it is possible to find the best possible parents to a child. In conclusion, homosexual couples should be allowed to adopt children but that right should perhaps be limited in the beginning. Every child in every kind of family might go through hard times and this argument can therefore not be used against homosexual couples. Decreasing chances to adopt children also for heterosexuals could be the result if homosexual couples would be allowed to adopt children. That is a risk society should be willing to take. There are mothers that agree to their child being adopted by homosexuals and letting these children live with to people of the same sex wouldn't be to experiment with their lives. A study made by the university of Gothenburg shows that the constellation of the family is less important than how the child is raised and how it is supported by society. The right to apply for adoption and be examined should apply to everyone. If the homosexual couple is denied an adoption because their financial situation isn't satisfactory, it would be acceptable. If they are denied an adoption because their home doesn't look suitable for a child to live in, that too would be acceptable. It would not be acceptable to deny them the chance of adopting a child simply because they are homosexual. In an article in the Dagens Nyheter 99-11-27, it was argued why homosexual couples mustn't be allowed to adopt children. What is best for the child is what is most important, it is also important for the child to know later in life that the adoption was carried out in an proper way. International adoptions to Sweden might stop if a law was introduced, granting homosexual couples the right to adopt children, since many countries don't want to give children up for adoption by homosexuals. The right for homosexual couples to adopt children internationally would have to be preceeded by working for the homosexuals' rights in other parts of the world.$$$﻿ The Growing Number of Students In Private Schools The education system is always an interesting topic of discussion. Speaking as a future teacher it is even more interesting for me to reflect on this matter since I'm soon going to be confronted with this reality. There are a couple of trends that you can find if you look at the present situation. The most striking is that nowadays more and more parents choose to put their kids into private schools instead of putting them in public schools. The question that we now have to ask ourselves is of course, why is that? The most important cause for this is that parents are not content with the local public schools. This isn't surprising as there have been numerous reports about the decline of the public schools. Bad social conditions in the schools and the fact that classes now consist of a greater number of students are reasons for concern. Parents are worried that their children are being distracted by this and that it interferes with their achieving in accord with their potential. Their solution to the problem is to put their kids into private schools and the result is that more and more students now go to private schools. In order to get a better view on the matter we must look at a few things that make private schools a better option than public schools. These features are also important causes why private schools appeal to so many students. The working conditions in private schools are better than in public schools. Whereas funds are cut in public schools private schools maintain have a better financial situation. Private schools have a smaller number of students and that results in a calmer environment for the students and helps them concentrate on studying. Another thing that improves the working conditions in private schools is the fact that most pupils in private schools want to study. They are aiming for an academic future and therefore they try their best to keep their grades up and don't cut classes or disturb the classroom work. This is very important since the working conditions are a vital part of how the students perform. Even though the general conditions of the schools are very important another essential part is the quality of the education, which is said to be of a higher standard at private schools. Could it be that private schools attract better teachers? Of course it's very hard to determine who are the best teachers but private schools can often handpick their teachers from a larger selection. This is because they have larger salaries and it means that when they are hiring new staff obviously more teachers will apply for the job and then they get a larger selection to choose from. Naturally the better working conditions affect the teachers as well making them more harmonious and let them focus on their teaching. There is also a pressure from the parents of the children attending the school to have really competent teachers since they are paying large tuition fees and obviously want the standard of the education to be very high. The tuition fees are one of the reasons why the number of students in private schools is not increasing more dramatically. It's just too expensive for an ordinary family to send the children to a private school. Even though the tuition fees are quite large you have to understand that the money obtained is used to maintain a high quality of education. But as more and more private schools are being started the fees will get smaller and the number of students in private schools will continue to rise. In conclusion you can say that private schools are definitely on the rise. This is mainly because there is a need for another form of education. With the continuing decline of public schools there is no wonder that parents choose to put their kids into private schools. This is a development that will continue in the future if something isn't done about the present situation in public schools. Something has to be done fast because after all everybody should have the right to a good education.
EE576	0	﻿ Raise the teachers' salaries! It is common known that today's Sweden, to a great extent, lacks qualified teachers. All too few teachers are being educated, and many who are certificated teachers choose to work elsewhere than in school. This should not be a surprise though, as both their status and salaries are low in comparison with other academics. If you in addition to this, consider how rough the teachers' working conditions are today, it is obvious that something has to be done to change their situation. It is absolutely necessary to raise the teachers' wages, in order to give them a salary that corresponds with their assignments, and make the profession attractive again. But is it then so hard to be a teacher? I claim that it is, and in this essay I'm going to try to convince you, that the teachers' salaries are much too low in addition to their contemporary working conditions. The teaching profession has always been demanding. Teachers have always been expected to do a lot of extra work that not has been included in their scheduled working hours; lessons have had to be prepared and written tests and essays corrected. And today the working burden has become even heavier. A teacher's job is not any more only to make sure that its pupils pass their examinations and keep calm in class. Humanity and individualism have become a part of the Swedish schools, and even though this of course is positive, it has increased the pressure on the teachers. Today, evaluation of the individual pupil's development and progress is a part of the learning process. The teacher has to organize conversations between teacher, parents and child regularly. This is not only taking a lot of the teacher's time with a lot of planning required and meetings have to be taken place in the evenings, but the closer contact with the parents also puts psychological pressure on the teacher. It is supposed to make all parts comfortable in the delicate situations that can arise when children's skills are being discussed. However, the teacher's role as a psychologist doesn't stop at these specific situations. In its daily work, the teacher are supposed to catch all pupils' interest at the same time, and be able to handle all their different needs. Many pupils require extra attention and help and make this a difficult task. The teacher feels that it is not enough. Assisting teachers for pupils with special needs are rare and the teacher can't be there for everybody all the time. In a time when the classes are growing bigger this is getting even harder. Politicians seem to think that teachers are magicians. With less money, fewer lessons and more students, they are supposed to be doing miracles and reach a higher ambition level. The teachers' responsibilities do not either end with education in the form of school subjects as math and English. The teacher is an adult with whom the pupils spend their whole day, to which the small children look up to and imitate. It becomes a part of its students' upbringing, whether it likes it or not. The school is a social community, where children learn to act among other people than their family. And the school of today is not an easy world to live in. The teacher is supposed to guide the pupils through the jungle of social and emotional problems that can arise in school. It is supposed to discover if a child is feeling bad, if it is being treated badly in school or at home. The lack of welfare officers makes this task even harder. But it is not only a question of children being treated badly and feeling bad at school. Today the school is not a safe place to be, for teachers as well as for pupils. An increasing number of students bear guns and bully their teachers. In many schools the pupils are "taking over the classrooms" and teachers are afraid of going to their jobs. As you can see the teachers' working conditions are hard. They are supposed to act both as mentors and psychologists, but do only get paid for teaching. They have great responsibilities and it is time that they are being rewarded for that. They must feel that they are appreciated, so that they will have the strength to improve the Swedish schools. It is time that we invest in the teachers and raise their salaries, before we do not have any left. An investment in our teachers is an investment in our children, and thus an investment in our future.$$$﻿ NO TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF XENOTRANSPLANTATION Just a couple hundreds of the 90 000 people who die in Sweden every year donate their organs. This has lead to longer queues and time of waiting for transplantation of organs. And it is calculated that 15-20 percent of those on the waiting list will die before a suitable organ becomes available. As a solution to this problem are some scientists working on research on xenotransplantation, which means to move organs between different species. In this case to move organs between pigs and human beings. The thought is to gene manipulate pigs to get them suitable as donors of organs. So in future transplantations it would be possible to replace human tissue with pigs' cells and organs. But unfortunately there are to many risks and much unfairness connected with it. Therefor I think xenotransplantation is not the right solution on the lack of organs and it should not be developed either. First of al I am against the development of xenotransplantation because it entails risks such as transmission of unknown viruses and other infectious diseases from the pigs to the human body. Of course, some complications could be acceptable though the receiver of a pig organ may get higher life quality, but an infection could be contagious for the people nearest the patient and possibly even to society. Therefore I would prefer another solution to the lack of organs. Public information about the lack of organs and discussions about the consequences of xenotransplantation would help. I think a lot of people would change their mind if they were informed. The problem with the lack of organs should also be presented for children at school so that they from an early age get used on the thought of donating their organs. That way more people would be ready to donate their organs and such need for organs that exist today would not exist. Another reason to why I am against the development of xenotransplantation is the thought on how xenotransplantation could be used by the companies that have spent money on research on xenotransplantation. I mean that those who are going to be the sellers of the gene manipulated pig organs will try to make big business on them without carrying on the ethical consequences. One must realise that those companies are not charitable institutions, and that it is therefore possible that poor people in the third world would not have access to these organs, which would lead to an increase of injustice in our world. This make me wonder: Who would indeed be most benefited by xenotransplantation? Would it be the patient, the seller, the whole society or no one? I think the most benefited would be the seller and the less the patient, by being infected by viruses or similar diseases, and society with the increasing of injustice as a consequence of the greed of the sellers. In this case xenotransplantation does not fill any function and should not therefore exist. Another thing that makes me critical against xenotransplantation is that the "donator-pigs" are exposed to a lot of pain. They suffer when they are used as patients in experimental transplantations with a lot of medicine that restrains the immune defence. Even genetical operations are painful for the pigs. The pigs used for xenotransplantation are not able to live a happy pig life either, as they are not allowed to root on the ground. I believe that humans do not have the right to change animals' genes and living conditions to get them suitable as donors of organ. We must think about how we would like to be treated ourselves and we should stoop utilising animals the way xenotransplantation does. What I have mentioned above are some of the reasons why I do not like to see xenotransplantation as the solution to the lack of organs. The development of xenotransplantation is too dangerous since pig's viruses could infect people. It is unfair since the sellers' greed would lead to an increase of injustice in our world. It is unfair, also, because it causes much pain for the pigs. I believe that if people who do not want to donate their organs reflect on their decision and change their mind it would be easier to stop the development of xenotransplantation and all the bad consequences of it.
EE572	0	﻿ English, my English! The English language has always been a matter of interest for me. Mainly because of the fact that you can use it almost everywhere in the world. To be able to communicate and to make yourself understood is the base in human relations. I was also inspired by a month-long vacation I spent with my family driving through Great Britain several years ago. In school, competent teachers have increased my interest and after graduation I worked in London for five months as a receptionist at a small bed and breakfast hotel. The first book I read in English was The castle of adventure by Enid Blyton a number of years ago. Since then I've come across several writers from different ages, all writing fiction or historical novels. When it comes to more advanced reading it is novels by Jane Austen that I've enjoyed most. Even though I don't know every word, I can still comprehend the context and sometimes I understand what the word means by seeing it in a situation. Reading articles in newspapers is a bit more difficult when they contain a lot of new and for me, unusual words. I don't have a problem speaking with people my own age, or adults, about common things like music, movies and every day life events. That kind of conversation feels quite natural and I can often speak rather fluently. I do have more trouble with difficult topics involving a lot of complicated words which can be hard to explain without knowing the exact meaning in Swedish. Talking in front of a group makes me uncomfortable and I'm aware of I need quite a lot of practise on that. It's easier if the group is small and if I'm well prepared for the task so I'll know what to say and know that what I'm saying is correct. I do believe that my pronounciation is acceptable with some minor mistakes. Of course, unusual and new words can be hard to pronounce when you rarely hear them or if you have never heard them before. Swedish people hear quite a lot of spoken English because of the frequent use on television and in music and understanding it comes rather natural as a result of that. I've no trouble comprehending standard English but different dialects like Scotish and Irish can be hard to follow. Another problem is swearwords which can be difficult to grade according to their strength. When you don't know how strong the curse is you don't know exactly what the person is saying about that certain thing. Slang is also something I can misunderstand and have a problem to interpret the right way, especially since that kind of words are continously developing. Understanding a conversation about a complicated subject can be hard, simply because I don't know enough words regarding that particular issue. I've written mostly letters in English, not very advanced, about common things to people my own age. In Upper Secondary School I've also made a couple of short essays and my special assignment was in English about Jane Austen. I like to write in English, trying to formulate the sentences the best way and chosing the right word for each situation. I can express what I want to say although my grammar can be faulty sometimes. Using certain phrases can be a problem when you can't translate them word for word but need to know the English counterpart. Coherence and cohesion is still a bit unclear and I believe I need to practise on that quite a lot. y conclusions are that I'm able to read modern fiction novels and a bit more advanced books as well without major problems. I've no difficulties understanding spoken standard English or the most usual accents. My pronounciation is, I believe, accetable and I can communicate rather fluently in English and make myself understood. I've written some in English but I still need to develop my writing and learn how to write a proper essay. I also need to practise speaking in front of a group and learn to understand and distinguish the different accents. Reading more advanced litterature and articles is also something I need to do to broaden my vocabulary which makes it easier to understand persons who use many advanced words when they speak.$$$﻿ It has been stated that role-playing teenagers risk loosing contact with reality. This is said to lead to mental and spiritual crises and even suicide. Other critics are of the opinion that role playing can result in increased violence. Different religious groups say that the imaginative religions that are part of the game may lead to occultism and psychological disturbances. y opinion is that role playing is, not only harmless, but actually good for you and that it should be encouraged. First of all we need to distinguish between role playing and other games that look similar but have a very different purpose. There are two types of role playing: lives, which can be compared to a play where the participants are the actors. You know which role you will play, but you don't know what the action will be like. The second type is conversation games which takes place in the players imagination. The leader of the game tells the players what their surroundings look like. The players then choose how to act. It is the ability to enter another character that makes the role playing special. You need to get to know the role you are to play and to know how this "person" will act in different situations. In conversation games you will also have to imagine the landscape surrounding your character. This is role playing. It may contain violence, but the aim of the game is never to kill the other players. More often you need to cooperate to succeed. Often you'll find that diplomatics and tactics will get you further than violence. Other games that are sometimes confused with role playing are paintball, laser-tag and killer games. In these games the aim is to kill all the other players. Most of the time role playing games mirrors problems from the real world in a fantasy or science fiction surrounding. This offers a nice background for discussing moral problems and solving logical puzzles. There are no easy solutions to problems and you have to use all your imagination and creativity to tackle them. A good strategy will help you in a fight and a clever scheme may keep you out of one. Role playing doesn't differ much from reality. There is violence in role playing, but every action has its consequences. You will never learn, as you may do from action movies, that the easiest way to deal with a problem is through violence. There have been many stories about teenagers who commit suicide when something goes wrong in the game. After some investigation most of these stories proved to be untrue and that the persons in question didn't even exist. In all the other cases there where other more likely explanations. Thousands of people attend lives or play conversation games and like every major activity it has its percentage of persons with psychological problems. It is possible that role playing may act as a trigger, but there is a difference between triggering something and causing it. The religions that are part of the imaginative society in a role-playing game are almost always copies of different religions in the real world. The contact with them can be no more dangerous than religion classes in school or reading antic myths or faerytales. Everything in our surrounding influence us. Everyday we are exposed to a million different impressions. There is no way for us to know exactly how these impressions will influence everyone of us. So far there is no evidence that role-playing should be bad for you, only speculations. What is perfectly clear though, is the good sides of role-playing. Role playing is a social activity; you have to be at least one player and one game leader. It promotes imagination and creativity as stated before. You will need the ability to make quick decisions and to find solutions to problems. Statistics tell us that intelligence among role players is above average.
EE409	1	﻿Over the years I've come into contact with the English language in different ways; through school, traveling, lectures held in English, literature etc. Not to mention the everyday exposure from television and media. These factors all have affected my competence in using English in different situations. In this essay I'm going to evaluate my skills in the different areas concerning the English language. I'll begin with my listeningskills. I love listening to English. It's like music, so beautiful and dramatic and it's spoken in so many different ways throughout the world. I don't have any problems understanding everyday English, but of course it's harder when it comes to old English, some dialects and technical language. I think that watching television is a very good way of listeningpractice. (I do that quite a lot.) Not only do you get to hear the language spoken in many different contexts, but you also get to hear many of its variants meaning British-, American- and Australian English, dialects etc. This is something you can not get at school to the same extent where it's mainly your teacher's English you hear. Of course the best thing maybe to travel around talking to different people, but if you don't have that alternative television will do. Next I will discuss my readingability. Although I enjoy reading books in my spare time I have to admit that I haven't done much reading in English, at least not fiction. But seeing that I'm studying Biology at the university and all our courseliterature is in English I've got lots of practice reading scientific texts. I think there is a difference though. Once you've learned the necessary terminology of the subject you're reading (which can be quite heavy), it's not hard to understand the text because they usually use common words that you are familiar with. Fiction on the other hand has a much more varied and expressive language with many words meaning the same thing but having different intensity. Here not understanding the meaning of a word can cause you to miss a feeling or mood in the story. Therefor I tend to get stuck on single words in stead of just read and focus on grasping the content. On the whole I think I'm doing fine and I can only get better at it with all these books to read in this course. No I will come to my two weakest points; speaking and writing. Speaking first. I haven't got much practice speaking English. I was a bit shy at school so I didn't really say much in the Englishclasses. I haven't been to any English-speaking country either and the little English I've used in other countries doesn't count for much. So this is something I really feel I need to practice. I think I have a rather good vocabulary but I don't feel quite confident and comfortable when I speak English, so that's my main goal with the speaking-classes. Here too I think watching television has a positive effect. I've learnt many expressions and words through listening and then when I speak these can pop up without me remembering memorizing them. That's pretty fantastic! I've probably done more writing than talking in English. We wrote quite a lot at school and I think it's great fun. Even so I don't think I'm as good at it as I would like to be. I think they should be focusing more on writing at school because when you write you have to be more aware of things like grammar and sentence structure than when you talk. I think you'd become a much better speaker by becoming a better writer. As fore me, I think I have pretty good knowledge of grammar and as I said before a good vocabulary, but I'm really not good at spelling (I have the same problem with the Swedish language by the way). So that's something I'll have to work on. I know that writing will improve my spelling but I also think that by paying more attention to the spelling of words when I read I'll get better at it. Now I've done my first writing-assignment for this course, evaluating my Englishskills. Hopefully I'll learn a lot from it.$$$﻿ Exercise: Good for your body and mind Great demands are made upon people today in form of long working hours, home and family. Many people burn themselves out and get ill. There are different ways of dealing with the stress we are exposed to and one of them is to exercise regularly. In this essay I am going to bring up some of the many positive effects exercise has on us physically as well as mentally but also discuss some negative aspects. Like I said there are both physical and mental advantages of working out although the physical may be what first comes to mind. The body consists of about 300 different skeleton muscles, some more prominent than others. Their functions are to stabilise the joints and of course to enable movement. If a muscle is not used it will eventually get debilitated and in the long run wither. Since we live in a world of convenience, where we really don't have to move much and tend to spend a lot of our time in front of the TV or the computer, training our muscles to maintain their strength is very important. To be able to handle our often quite sedentary jobs without suffering from sore backs, stiffness and similar problems we need strong supporting muscles. The heart is also a muscle, which needs to work to stay fit. When exercising we increase the capacity of the heart, that is the heart is able to pump more blood with each beat and that way it doesn't have to work so hard to keep the blood circulating. This and the fact that we by exercising can avoid overweight helps preventing cardio-vascular diseases which are getting more and more frequent among people today due to the fast food, semi-manufactured products and in many cases lack of knowledge about how to keep a healthy diet. Besides muscles we also have bones in our body, about 200 to be more exact. Between the bones are different joints that allow us to flex and extend for example our legs. If we don't get some exercise the joints stiffen and make it harder for us to move, we become less flexible. Our skeletons get strong and stabile from workout. The bones gets thicker and obtain a more efficient nutrient input due to the increased number of veins providing them with blood. Now I've pointed out some positive physical effects of exercising, but we are also affected positively mentally. Like I said in the introduction exercise is a good way to deal with stress which get more and more important in our fast moving society. Many people use exercise as a form of meditation since it is quite easy to let go of all thoughts while working out. So a good workout helps the body and mind to relax and afterwards we feel good about ourselves and we have got new energy to face our lives. The fact that we function better, I think, is a very good argument for companies to introduce the possibility for the employees to exercise during working hours. Even though most people know that exercising is good, there are still many who for different reasons don't exercise. Only 56 percent of the adult Swedish population workout on a regular basis. One reason people might have not to exercise, is that they feel they don't have the time. This argument is untenable. It's not necessary to go to a gym or to head out on hours-lasting runs. It can be quite small things like walking or taking the bicycle instead of going by bus or car. Using the stairs instead of the elevator and things like that. A negative side of exercising is that if it's overdone, done with wrong technique or if things go wrong we might get injured. But if we exercise in moderation, keeping our bodies fit actually decreases the risk of us getting hurt. So the advantages are greater than the disadvantages. I've tried to show some of the positive effects exercise can have on both our bodies and minds and that it can help us cope better with the every-day life. It's important to find a form of exercise that suits us and that we enjoy. The main point is that we should have fun while exercising otherwise it would just become another source of stress. I workout at 'Friskis & Svettis' three times a week and I enjoy every moment of it. I hope I have inspired someone to start exercising.
EE171	0	﻿ The end of the monarchy It is time to abolish the too long borne paradox of having a hereditary head of a democratic country like Sweden. How can it be defended? As I see it, and as I will show here, there are no reasons why the monarchy should not be dismantled as soon as possible. Firstly it is a hypocritical blot on our democratic to have a hereditary head of state. Secondly it is stupefying not to recognise that the reasons for keeping it now are simply a romantic admiration for aristocracy and thirdly that there would be no damages or affections in a hypothetical dismantlement. The most fundamental reason for abolishing the monarchy is of course the preposterousness of the post, as national and international representative for a democratic country, being hereditary. It is a paradox which makes the entire democratic debate loose credibility. The Swedish monarchy is of course no immediate threat to the democracy, but if no reasons are left for keeping it, then it seems strange not to follow the transition through. Some may say that the monarch is only the ceremonial leader - but is it not a matter of principle rather than actual power, since the king/queen has no political influence anyway? This lack of power makes the monarchy superfluous. Its uselessness and out-datedness can be seen through the screen of historic and fictional fascination, but in the real world this only leads to the kind of awkward position we are in today where a monarch without any power is still treated as superior because of old times sake. In role-plays and fantasies- fine, but it does not belong in reality. Keeping the monarchy shows a dullness and a stupidity. I say stupidity, because what else has possessed us to keep it? It is kept due only to a romantic notion of an aristocratic system which has not been up to date since the dark ages and even then it symbolised tyranny and feudal repression. It is time to take the step and admit that it no longer has a place in our society. Being thus stupefying, the monarchy has nevertheless kept its foot in through this romantic want for tradition and perhaps also a misguided protectiveness towards the people. But the truth is no one would really be affected, were the monarchy to repealed, except for the royal family itself, being deprived of the already humiliating task of cutting ribbons at openings, and parts of the older generation who enrich their lives with the latest society gossip. The former might experience a passing feeling of being at a loss, but some representative commission could be organised for them as a transitional solution. The latter group should be satisfied by all the new gossip ensuing from this upheaval of the family they associate themselves with to such an extent. On the international level the results of an abolishment would be even pettier. Seeing that these are very modest consequences, there is no real need for a substitute. As far as international matters are concerned, the monarchs neutrality already limit him/her to dealing with humanity questions, something which could be handled by the appropriate minister. In national matters the monarchs' role as ceremonial leader would have to go to either the prime-minister or some other (not necessarily political) Swedish authority, local or national, depending on the circumstances. There reasons for abolishing the monarchy thus carries far greater weight than any arguments for keeping it. There are, as I have shown, no defendable draw-backs to its dismantlement. Getting rid of this hypocrisy would strengthen our moral conscience and amplify our belief in democracy. Shall we allow a blot like this to make us if not liars, at least contradictory, simply because it is the way it has always been? The monarchy is long since outdated and remains now only as a romantic notion of past times. It is not unreasonable to ask weather it is not time to take an active stand in the question of the monarchy's future and breaking the long passive acceptance of such a bizarre institution.$$$﻿During almost my entire life i have been hearing lots of different languages. I was raised in Geneva, Switzerland witch is a very international city in a country with no less then three large official languages. Both my parents come from Sweden and thus i spoke both Swedish and French fluetly by the time i was six. Since Geneva is such an international city my friends came from a lot of different countries so apart from the French and Swedish i was "exposed" to a large number of languages like German, Italian, Portugese, Spanish etc. The summer I turned ten we moved back to Sweden (after 9 years) and settled in Uppsala. My english at the time was probably about as good as any Swedish child of the same age. After a few years in Sweden i finished the 9'th grade and went on a one month English-course in London. During this month i stayed in an English family together with two boys from Denmark, however since my Danish is far from great we usually spoke English with each other... After this I started senior school in a nature-science program. I kept on studying German (a subject I started to study during the 7'th grade) as well as English and graduated with good grades in the three English courses that i could choose (A,B and C) Then after a semester of French studies at the University of Uppsala i am now studing English. As mentioned above i have been listening to a large number of different languages for large parts of my life. Allthough i did not speak or understand several of these languages i am certain that this has given me a good base for my spoken English as well as my understanding of foreign languages. Geneva is as I mentioned a part of the French speaking region in Switzerland and thus I was mainly exposed to french TV and music contrary to Swedish children that are usually exposed to more English TV and music. However the differance was probably not that large since a large number of the TV-shows intended for children are translated in Sweden as well. One thing that has probably been very good for my english is the one month trip i made to London. During that time i was more or less forced to speak and listen to english at all times and this together with good teachers resulted in a great impovement in my spoken english as well as my abillity to listen to and understand english. My abillity to write has always been rated differentely depending on the teachers that i have had. My spelling in most languages has always been shall we say less then perfect... however my abillity to come up with ideas to write as well as getting these ideas down on a peice of paper has always been rather good. When it comes to vocabulary i have also always had a fairly large vocabulary in the languages that i have spoken (however as mentioned the spelling of these words was not always perfect...) During senior school i did start to improve my spelling and I intend to keep working with it during this course. Reading novels has never been any of my larger interests, i have usually not considered it as a form of toture either but i have been more interested in other things. I have however always liked to read magazines that took up issues that did interested me. During the past few years i have been having a subscription to at least one english magazine every month (Focus and Airliner World are the most recent ones) I have also been reading magazines like "Newsweek" or "Time magazine" that my father has subscribed to. I would not say that i am a fast reader but i guess i am rather average in that area. to summ this up i think that the childhood in a "multi-lingual" environement as well as my brief journey to London have been very good for my english and that my main strenghts lay in speaking as well as in my abillity to understand spoken english. What i will probably have to work the most with will probably be the written english and then particularly the spelling and different writing techniques.
EE589	0	﻿ English, My English! Since I first came in contact with the English language, when I was six years old, I have always enjoyed having to do with it. My preschool-teacher was originally from the USA and she taught us children American nursery rhymes. I have always liked listening to English, in songs, stories being told or just general speech. Even though English is not an official language in Sweden we Swedes hear it every day, on the news, in music and movies etc. Considering this, we practice our knowledge in the language almost every day, but we might not be aware of it. Sometimes watching an English- speaking soap-opera can increase ones vocabulary as much as reading an English novel and at the same time teach pronunciation. You can say a language consists of four parts, listening, reading, speaking and writing. All these parts are integrated and when you make improvements on one of the parts it is noticeable in the other areas as well. Working on weaknesses where it is needed the overall impression will be strengthened. For me learning English started with listening. Today I mange pretty well in most situations where I listen to instructions, directions etc, as long as the speaker does not talk too fast or use a too specified vocabulary (like in a discussion about engine parts or the anatomy of a dinosaur). Having spent one year in the USA I have made progress in understanding varieties and different dialects in English, even colloquial differences. One mistake I make sometimes is that I am sure I understand something, but later I discover that I had misunderstood the whole idea - fortunately it does not happen very often. I think it is fun to listen to people speaking English and to try to figure out from where they are or where they have picked up their accent. I practice listening by watching English speaking movies and TV shows and avoiding reading the subtitles. By doing this I learn new words and idioms, which I later can use, for example, in my writing. To write has never been my strongest side, even though I don't mind putting thoughts into words on paper. One of my problems is that I almost always write the way I speak and by doing that it is easy to get stuck in a certain jargon that might not suit the assignment. I never hesitate to look up words in dictionaries and thesauruses. The fact that I read quite a lot helps to make improvements in this matter. To pick up different varieties of wording I try to read everything written in English I get my hands on, novels, newspapers, the back of cereal-boxes etc. Reading gives more time for exact understanding than listening, I think. When I read I have time to go back and re-read and to look up things I don't understand and ask questions about what I read. I am not too fond of analyzing texts, but I can work my way through almost everything with the help of a dictionary. I don't give up even when the task at first seems impossible. I think it is fun to explore the small differences between words, why some words can be used in a certain situation and others can't. The ultimate goal of learning a language must be being able to speak it - correctly. The reason I think so is it is a way of expressing opinions and beliefs in a more direct way than writing. When I write I can always go back and make corrections, but in speech what has been said has been said, there is no turning back. I often get frustrated when I can't find the right word or expression for something I want to say and I don't have the time to look it up. When it happens I can either get totally stuck and have to start all over again or take a long way around that particular word I can't find in my memory and still make my point. I don't hesitate to take longer time or use more words than necessary as long as the person I talk to understands and won't get lost somewhere in my babbling. English is a pretty language. I want to improve my language skills in all areas and I think that is my biggest strength. My biggest weakness is that I sometimes don't take the time to make the proper improvements - I want to learn as much as possible in as little time as possible. I know from experience that I make the best betterments by making mistakes.$$$﻿ English, My English! I feel so fortunate to have a second language. Having English as my second language I can be understood by billions of people throughout the world. I can understand people whose daily life and culture are very unfamiliar to me, and through English can be my closest friends. What a feeling! In the Spring of 1998, I was granted a scholarship to study at an American university. I studied photography, French, and Spanish, but I also took the opportunity to take English courses at different levels. Reading books in English was rather new to me before I left Sweden for America. Of course, I had struggled through Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" and other compulsory novels to read in upper secondary school, but I couldn't really enjoy a novel, or get the feeling of it, as I always fell into, what I would like to call it, the look-up-words-addiction. Spending half an hour reading one page in a paper back, looking up every single word I didn't get a satisfactory grasp of, I easily got tired of reading. Once I realised I didn't have to look up all words I didn't comprehend to get the context of the novel, I began to read with pleasure. Reading and listening are two totally different components of a language. A word can sound so different from what you've seen it spelled in books. Leaving for America I was rather confident in listening at British and American English, that is the standard versions. I knew before arriving at Savannah Airport that Savannians tend to have a southern drawl. Everything seemed to go smoothly until that day when I tried to get access to my e-mail account at my school's computer laboratory. I had to ask an assistant for help. He told me to type in the password "pine". But that man did not pronounce pine as I would. I looked at him, put my fingers on the keyboard and typed p-a-a-n. He said, "NO, NO, listen to me, PINE!" Once again he did the southern drawl with a noticeable impatience in his voice. My fingers started trembling as I typed p-a-n. "Oh, no", he said, gave me an indication to remove my hands from the key board, and typed p-i-n-e. "Ya know, the tree!?!" "Oh, you mean pine!", I exclaimed triumphant. He mumbled "Yeah" and walked away. I could read his mind thinking "those stupid foreigners". As I've always imitated people, I truly enjoy listening to different dialects and accents. Walking through a market place in London, hearing men shouting in true Cockney-English or listening as two black women are having a violent discussion in Ebonics really makes my day. As my listening skills are rather good, my writing skills are not as developed. Only writing one, two-page essay per year in upper secondary school, I never got enough training to enhance my ability to write good essays and papers. The previous year, I got to improve my writing skills through writing papers on current issues, such as affirmative action. Planning to write the essay one week in advance to make sure that I will have time to revise it once or twice, I often end up writing it the night before it is due, and typing it in the morning. Well, sometimes you just can't postpone things. That is true when you're in a play. December 2 1998, it was time for me and my co-star to step out on the stage for our opening night. I did my first attempt to act in English. It was a one-act play called "Ariel Bright". (Ariel was the name of the leading role, and I was to interpret it). I spend many hours memorising lines and trying to get the right intonations at the right places. It wasn't an easy game, but I did good. Since I often forget to articulate as I speak (even in Swedish), I had to work on that. Even after the play I reminded myself to articulate and it gave results. I didn't have to repeat myself as often as I usually did. Spending my daily life in America I naturally learned to take part in relaxed conversations in English. That way I learnt new idiomatic expressions and words that I wouldn't be taught in school for various reasons. Only after a few days of living in America I started to think, dream, and react in English. If I suddenly got surprised a Swedish "AH!" didn't come out of my mouth, rather a HOLY COW!" Though I think it is very important to keep one's native language closest to heart, (as culture and childhood memories are connected to language), I still want to become as fluent in English as I am in Swedish. That is my goal.
EE579	0	﻿ SHOULD "SOFT DRUGS" BE LEGALISED? All over the world there is a discussion about narcotic politics. On one side there arethose who suggest a liberalisation or even a legalisation of the "soft" narcotics (marijuana and haschish), while people on the other side wants restrictive narcotic politics. I agree with the ones who believe in restrictive and preventive narcotic politics, and don't believe in a legalisation of drugs, not even "soft drugs". In this essay, I'll take up some of my main arguments againstlegalisation of "soft drugs". First of all I would like to tear down one argument, used by advocators of legalising "soft drugs". They claim that "soft drugs" are harmless, but it's proved that even small dozes of for example haschish hurt the brain and use of "soft drugs" also lead to further experimentation on other drugs. They are often an entrance to heavier drugs. Secondly, people who want a legalisation of the "soft drugs" can't answer questions on how they are planning to carry this out. For example I would like to know by whom the quality of the drugs will be checked, and who'll decide the strength and price of them? If drugs from society are lighter, and perhaps also more expensive than the ones on the street, no one will buy them. Other questions which the followers of legalising don't have any answers to are for example if the State will have monopoly of drugbusiness or if private corporations will have access to it as well. And have they planned to have agelimits, or restrictions for people with sensitive and important jobs like drivers, doctors, teachers and pilots? How much and how often should you be able to buy drugs? Will "drug-shops" be open twenty-four-hour a day? If not, people who want drugs will buy them on the streets anyway. I haven't received any answers on these questions, but spokesmen for legalisation maybe have planned to release "soft drugs" without any regulations at all, because regulations only create conditions for a black market. Besides that the campaign to legalise "soft drugs" gives non-satisfaction answers, or often lack out of answers on how they plan to carry out their ideas, there are more reasons against legalisation of the "soft drugs". One of these reasons is that there's a connection between access to narcotics and use of them. If society decides to legalise "soft drugs" it becomes easier for people to buy them, and thereby they might end up in an abuse, because of the increased access to "soft drugs". This also effects the connection between supply and demand of these drugs. If there's a combination of easy access to large amount of "soft drugs" with liberal attitude from society about drugs, more persons will try the legal drugs, also those who wouldn't have tried if drugs had been illegal. This lead to higher demand and suddenly "soft drugs" have created a legal market with supply and demand. To decrease the number of (ab)users there must be a small access to narcotics and difficult to get hold of them. If there also are unpleasant consequences for using or dealing with drugs the amount of people who is taking them won't increase in the same way as if "soft drugs" were legalised. Left is only a group that run the risk of getting into drugabuse from the beginning. This group can society reach through support and treatment. Only then abuse can be defeated. Society must take responsibility for its citizens. Abuse have to be seen in a social relation, not in a medical one. Society must prevent that young people gets into drugabuse, by preventive work, by not legalise drugs and by helping addicts through treatment. We must believe in society without narcotics, and not let "soft drugs" be legalised. It's when we give up our hope of a drugfree society legalisation movement can win. That's why many people supports "harm reduction" movement instead of supporting preventive work. Unfortunately "harm reduction" alone can't decrease the number of addicts. We need for example preventive work among young people to stop them from trying drugs. If the number of addicts shall decrease, society can't declare that it's all right to use drugs. Then young people get a liberal attitude towards drugs and they are more likely to try them. If it also is easy to get "soft drugs" and that it's legal to use them, many more risk to end up in an abuse. When "soft drugs" no longer are strong enough, addicts will move over to heavier drugs, and this way society never will get rid of drugabuse and narcotics, and social misery will increase. We must declare a war against narcotics, instead of be resigned to drugabuse.$$$﻿It all started in fourth grade. I was ten years old and about to have my first English lesson. How I enjoyed that. I gladly took home my books, in which I had written down the fifteen words that we had to learn for the next week. Since then I have been struggling with learning to be a better speaker, listener, writer and reader of English. It has not always been simple, as you will see. But I have had a lot of fun on the way. Throughout high school I did not have any bigger problems with listening and understanding English. To a certain degree I can thank TV for that. I watched many American shows and learned to listen and understand English. When I, after one year of high school, went to the United States to study I got to practice all that I have learned the past seven years. When I first heard my host father speaking, I was shocked and thought, "What is he saying? What language is he talking?" But it did not take many days to learn to understand him, and everybody else for that matter. So listening was no problem. Until I was on my way home and we made an intermediate landing at Heathrow Airport, London. I was in a shop to buy something to eat, and it was my turn to pay. The cashier started talking to me and I did not understand one word of what she said! Not one single word! She must have thought I was an idiot standing there saying "what?" to everything that she said. It was a big difference from the American English that I had gotten used to. Now, though, when I have not been in the United States for several years I have no problem in understanding British English. In the ten years that I studied English in Sweden, I did not read many books in English, we never had to. But when I was in the U.S I discovered the joy of reading. It is not just fun to sink into an imaginary world and forget the reality, it is also a very good way of keeping up and learning a language. I remember lying in my bed reading an English book and thinking for myself. Wow, I am reading a book in a totally different language, and I understand everything. It was an amazing feeling. So reading is not a big problem for me. I do have problems with my writing though. My grammar is not the best, even though I think I write perfectly well. I feel quite competent in spelling, but of course there are many difficult words in English too, as there are in every language. One of my first writing experiences is when I was around ten or eleven years old. A friend and I were going to write a letter to "DJ Cat" on the "DJ Cat Show" on the Sky Channel. We liked his show very much so we wanted to write and tell him that. I remember one sentence in particularly. We were going to write "we like you very much", but we did not know how to spell the word much. We pondered and pondered upon how it was spelt. Finally we came up with a quite logic one, at least we thought so. We wrote "we like you very match". Hopefully I have improved my writing since then. I am certainly a better speaker after spending a year in the U.S. I have improved my ability to speak spontaneously. I love to speak English, even though I say many things wrong. Which happened a few times in the U.S. The English I had learnt in Sweden did not always work over there. I remember asking my host mother for a rubber. She stared at me and asked if I meant that I needed an eraser. She explained the difference, and I felt a little embarrassed, since the word rubber means "suddgummi" in British English but condom in Am. Eng. I still laugh about it and now I feel more confident in my talking, knowing that we all say the wrong things now and then. In conclusion I could say that I know English quite well. I can survive in an English speaking country without any problems. But there are also lots that I do not know about English, but that I am eager to learn about, to apply the grammar correctly, for instance. I am willing to work hard to achieve the goals I have set. And I know that if I do, I will be a better speaker, listener, writer and reader of the English language.
EE578	0	﻿y first assignment has everything to do with evaluation. I am to evaluate my skills concerning writing, reading, speaking and listening to English. Could be that my former English-teachers would know my strengths and weaknesses better than me, but since they are nowhere near to turn to, I am on my own. As a future teacher myself, it will be my responsibility to make sure my students know enough English to qualify them for higher education. I will not be able to do that, unless I study English really hard. Through my living years, I have always been able to express my ideas, opinions and reflections without complications verbally. To write, on the other hand is much more difficult of a task. The grammar must be correct or the message could easily change into something quite different than from what first was intended. It has also been told to me how important it is to have a good structure. Structure is the backbone of every written and told story. Without structure, it is all a mess. I am working on that right now. This English course has made me think about my days in upper secondary school and the realisation that I seldom had the opportunity to write essays in English. If essays had been a regular part of the class, I do not think I would be so nervous having to write these essays now. It is both terrifying and quite exhilarating at the same time. I am to study English, which I have been interested in my entire life. Fortunately, I have past experience as an au pair and a little moonlighting as a translator (I was designated, I did not volunteer). My assignment was to listen and then make sure the audience received the main message from my lips. Hopefully I will not be in that situation in a near future again. I am not likely to get embarrassed having to stand in the spotlight even if I do not like it all the times. It is rarely an issue for me. An oral presentation would probably only give me an adrenaline rush. This English course involves more than writing, listening and speaking English. Reading occupies the most of my time. A large amount of books are to be read in a short period of time. According to my schedule, there are one short story and one novel per week to read. My only objection is the tempo really. To read, in particular, does not worry me much. I usually understand what I am reading. If I do not, I just look up the words or try to understand by the context. Further more, I am now reading books I never would borrow from the library on my own initiative. It is obligatory to read all of the books. Some of them are actually very good. All in all, I believe that if people put their minds into something, in this case listening, reading, speaking and writing English, there is nothing they can not accomplish. With a positive basic outlook, nothing can stop us from completing our education. Temporary setbacks are common among us students. It is by our mistakes we learn, and that is what I intend to do.$$$﻿I will try to assess my skills in the English language as clearly and thoroughly as possible. To do so I will start by giving a brief account of my English studies and my encounters with the English-speaking world. I find this relevant as it has greatly influenced my knowledge of the English language. I will then proceed to evaluate my skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. While I was learning English at school I visited England on four occasions, all confined to the southern part of the country. This enhanced my English skills, and strengthened the RP I was taught at school. When I was in upper secondary school, I took a Cambridge course of Proficiency in English in which I practised all the skills mentioned above, but writing in particular. After that I went to Ireland, where I stayed for fourteen months, working in a racing yard. y stay in Ireland made me quite confident in understanding the spoken language, having all the people in my surroundings, both at work and at home (I stayed with an Irish family), speaking English. I can follow most conversations without making a great effort. My passive vocabulary has become fairly extensive and covers many areas, and when I come across a word I don't know I can usually work out its meaning from the context in which it is spoken. On the other hand I can still have problems understanding when someone is speaking very fast or with a strong dialect like Northern Irish or Scottish. I also find that I have to concentrate in order to keep up with a conversation in a noisy environment. y speaking skills have also been influenced by my time in Ireland. I speak English almost fluently but with a distinct Irish accent. Unfortunately my active vocabulary is not as extensive as the passive. As I spent most of my time with unskilled workers I did not very often find myself in a situation where difficult words or complex terminology were used. Although I use the words in Swedish and know them in English I'm not used to using them, but tend to express myself in uncomplicated words and sentences when speaking. I don't make very many grammatical mistakes, but I have acquired some dialectical expressions, which would not be considered grammatically correct. I sometimes mispronounce words with which I am not familiar. I'm a fast speaker by nature, therefore I don't always articulate the words fully, this combined with my accent can make it difficult for people to understand me. As I am aware of this I usually make an effort to speak slowly and clearly, but sometimes it slips my mind. Being able to read and assimilate a text written in English is a very useful skill. I feel one of my best attributes considering reading is that I enjoy it so much. Therefore I read a lot of books, preferably in English (if that is the original language), as I feel it gives me a more direct connection to the author. Consequently I have become a fast reader which is very advantageous when there is a lot of text to be covered. It has also enhanced my vocabulary considerably. And as for listening, I can make sense of most texts even if I don't know all the words. On the other hand, if a specialised terminology is used, or the text is discussing a field with which I am not familiar I can have difficulties understanding it. Writing is the skill in which I have had the least practice. I did do a lot of writing when I was at school, but that is more than three years ago, and since then all I've produced is a couple of letters and e-mails. Consequently I feel a bit rusty and I have forgotten much of the spelling and grammar I used to know by heart. On the other hand my stay in Ireland has given me a better feel for the language in general. I think I make better use of my vocabulary when writing than I do when speaking, as the former allows me more time to think through the best way to put my thoughts into words. However I am not quite confident regarding my choice of words, and I think I sometimes write too informal, the way I would speak. To sum it all up, I feel fairly confident in my English-skills, though I know I still have a lot to learn.
EE375	1	﻿ An Ocean of Choice The last two decades can certainly be called the Age of Information because of the fantastic developments in all areas concerning information technology. Another possible denomination of this period could be the Age of Television since the explosive developments of television have come to affect our lives in many positive, as well as negative, ways. Our relationship with this square machine has, however, never been frictionless, even though the problems have taken different proportions over the years. Today there are more questions than ever raised about whether our relationship to television is good or not, and I am about to discuss some of the concerns people of today have about these matters, as well as possible solutions for making our relationship better. In order to understand how rapidly our television habits have changed, one does not need to go back more than a few years in time to point out significant differences in our way to look upon them. In my childhood home television was, unlike today, never a topic for discussion. It was simply seen as a nice complement to every day life; nothing more, nothing less. Only being able to choose between two channels and not having access to programs other than the ones listed shortly in one column in the TV-guide, there were very seldom conflicts about what to watch and when to watch it. Nor had my parents any reason at all for worrying about me watching programs not suitable for me since they had full control over what was shown on the screen. Our single complaint in those days may have been the lack of variety in what was offered, and we often wished there were more on television to be watched. This situation has however dramatically changed in a relatively short period of time. Today we have no reason to complain about shortage of programs. We have at present access to all categories of movies, cartoons, documentaries and newscasts twenty-four hours a day, at least if we are willing to pay an amount of money each month for cable television or television via satellite. Most Swedish households are today willing to pay this amount in order to take part of the seemingly unlimited ocean of television, which contains programs for all thinkable tastes. Adults as well as children have today opportunity to visit all corners of the world and by that learn about different cultures, languages and ways of living. But this new opportunity has proved not to be entirely positive. Another aspect of the enormous offer of programs is that television simply offers too much of everything. In addition to educational programs and well-made movies, television also offers a wide range of programs not very well made and often containing high levels of violence. This fact has developed into a very completed problem involving children's habits of watching them, to which there are no simple solutions. Because of the enormous offer of channels, children are today able to watch programs less suitable for them to a much greater extent than before. Many parents feel that they have lost control of what their children are watching. There are many concerns about the high levels of violence in cable television, and voices are being raised for introducing some kind of censorship of violent programs during daytime. This would however be unfair to adults who wish to watch these programs at whatever time of the day they like, and that is the major reason why networks are not willing to adapt their broadcasts to children's needs only. A possible solution to this problem is now being discussed in the US, a country that has been facing these problems perhaps longer than Sweden. A new technology in the form of an anti violence chip, that may be added to the television set, makes it possible to block out certain programs containing violence. The difficulty with such a technology is, however, how to determine what kind of violence that is considered to be the most dangerous for children. What do we want to protect our children from? Is it violence in cartoons, violence in action movies or violence seen on the news? Some children might find the exaggerated kind of violence in cartoons very frightening while others find it nothing but entertaining. Children are all different, some are more sensitive than others are, and it is hard to determine the effect violence has on them. It seems like our love and hate relationship will continue. Television has become a great part of our lives and maybe we had better get used to it. There is however no reason for not discussing what is shown on the screen, as there many programs both adults and children can manage perfectly well without. In order to keep parental responsibility for what our children are watching, parents must help each other out and have an open discussion about the complicated matter. The future might bring simple solutions that will allow us to pick only the good parts and reject the bad, but as for now we get it all in one package- good as well as bad.$$$﻿When I was given an assignment to write an essay, in which I'm asked to evaluate my strengths and weaknesses in the English language, it did leave me pondering over the matter a great deal. I haven't thought about my skills in English for many years and now I realize why. It's simply because I haven't practised them enough since I graduated from school which, I might as well add, I did ten years ago. I had at that point spent an additional year in the United States, as a foreign exchange student. Returning to Sweden after my stay there I was more confident than ever about my English skills being good, and for some unexplanatory reason I've kept that confidence throughout the years. Going back to school, to study English here in Uppsala, has however brought me rather abruptly back to earth, if not deeper. This first week at school has been the first confrontation with English for a very long time, and I've come to the conclusion that I do have forgotten very much. It's a shame that I've hardly spoken or written anything in English for such a long time, and that I've still expected my English skills to be good. Of course I've been abroad a couple of times which has given me the opportunitiy to have conversations in English, but a short conversation in a foreign language once or twice a year is not enough. A habit that I do have kept throughout the years is the habit of reading. I've always read a lot, mostly in Swedish but often books in English as well. Even though I usually tend to read "best-sellers", not very heavy literature that is, I consider myself a fairly good reader. It depends on interest, naturally, as it takes me much longer to finish a book I'm not interested in compared to one in which I am. Even "best-sellers" contain a great many words I'm not able to translate into Swedish, and I often have to look them up in a dictionary. More often, however, I don't look them up as you understand the meaning in the context of the text. I consider my skills in listening to spoken language as good as in written one. As long as the speaker has got an accent to which I'm familiar, I've got no trouble what so ever to follow. I've noticed, however, that I do have a harder time to understand a British accent than an American one. This becomes quite clear to me especially when I'm watching TV. Considering the fact that I've been exposed to the American accent daily for a year in my youth, and additionally watch American Shows on TV in much greater extent than I watch British ones, it does make sense to me. Talking of accents, I would like to cover my skills of speaking, in the meaning of my own ability to speak English. I remember coming back from the US with a fluency in spoken English I'd never had before. I went proudly back to school, as I still had one more year to attand before graduation, being proud of my improvement in English. The teacher, on the other hand, made it immediately very clear to me that she didn't approve of my American accent. British accent and spelling were all what she accepted, and was therfore on my back all the time. I was very unhappy about this, I still am, because it mixed everything up in a way. I'm still, at this day, confused in the matter. I've noticed, especially when I speak, that I pronounce words different all the time. I try so hard to get a British accent but I always end up speaking with a Swedish-British-American pronounciation which I'm not pleased with. Pronounciation and fluency in speech will be trained daily, among other things, at the University, and I look forward to recieve this training. I've realized that I need it..... Sitting here, writing the essay on the computer, makes this very moment a hitorical one. In what way, you as a reader might ask. Well, this is actually the first time ever I've written anything in English on the computer. I was introduced to IT rather late in my life, and didn't get the hang of it until a couple of months ago. It's not the computer alone I find a bit awkward, it's also the fact that I haven't written anything in English, especially not an essay, for many, many years. I honestly don't recall the last time I wrote.... anything. But once you get started it's difficult to stop as I don't mind writing at all. In fact I like it very much, and I'm positive about that my writing skills, and the other skills, will be improved during this term. Some things I've forgotten will come back to me, and other things I'll learn. There is no question about it. Or at least I wouldn't like to believe so.
EE374	1	﻿When I was eleven years old I started to study English at school. I didn't get a really good start because I didn't understand why I had to learn English and therefore I wasn't very eager to learn. The most important thing why I never was a good student in English, I think, was that I found it very boring. I couldn't understand what others found so fascinating about knowing a foreign language. Because of all these reasons, I was always behind in my English studies and when I graduated from senior high school my English marks were low. I realized that I had to do something about it to be admitted to the University so I went to Boston, MA to work as a nanny for a year. In the beginning of my year in the USA it was hard to be around people who only spoke English, but after a few weeks I could understand almost everything the family was talking about. The family I lived with was big, five children and their parents, so I always had someone to talk to or listen to. It was very good practice. Now I had a reason to learn how to understand English. The children I took care of told me things that had happened at school, etc. and I really wanted to understand every word they were telling me. Now I can feel comfortable when people are talking to me in English. What I still find pretty hard is to understand some English spoken by people from Great Britain because I'm so used to American English. What I found most difficult during my stay in the USA was to talk without sounding like a five-year old. During the first months my speaking really improved but after a while I found myself standing on the same spot, not improving at all. I wanted to be able to speak about serious things but couldn't find the words that said what I wanted to. I still feel that I can improve my English speaking a lot, but on the other hand I feel I can have an everyday conversation with English speaking people. Before I went to Boston I hadn't read one whole book in English. I didn't read very much when I was there either except for the books I read to the children, which actually was a lot. I think the reason why I didn't read so much when I was abroad was that I was so tired of English in the evenings and weekends. In my spare time I'd rather write letters in Swedish to my friends and family at home. When I returned to Sweden after a year in Boston it was nice to speak Swedish again but after a while I started to miss the English language. It was a very strange feeling because I never thought that could happen to me. I started to read some books in English and really enjoyed it. I'm still reading a lot more books in Swedish than in English but it's nice to know that it's not that hard to read in English. I also think reading is a simple but efficient way to learn the language better. I don't know if reading English will make me a better writer but I sure hope so. I would never advise anyone to work as an au-pair if their only goal was just to improve their writing skills because you don't have to write a single word in English, I didn't anyway. I feel like my writing is as bad as it was before I went abroad. I have always enjoyed writing in Swedish so I hope, with some help and a lot of hard work, I will improve my writing skills a lot. I think that the best way to learn a language is to stay in a country with native speakers for a year or so. It worked for me anyway, but I think I had improved even more if I went there to study. Than I would have been forced to write and read. A year abroad made me understand the reason why I have to learn English and, even more important, now I can find it enjoyable to learn a second language.$$$﻿ Arguments to take stand against capital punishment Before I joined Amnesty International I had a lot of thoughts about the death penalty. I didn't know whether I was for or against the punishment. Now I know for sure that I am against the capital punishment. My conviction is based on three arguments against death penalty: the state can't show that it's wrong to kill by killing, someone that is not guilty can be convicted and death penalty does not act as a deterrent. I think that everybody can understand that the relatives of the victim want some sort of revenge on the person who might have killed their family member, but I don't think a state can show its citizens that something is wrong to do by doing exactly the same thing but in the name of the law. The Government must think in terms of right and wrong and shouldn't let emotions take over. People that is affected by a loss, on the other hand, aren't able to think clearly. Of course we must understand the feelings those people have but I don't think that the Government should show that they care about their citizens by killing some of them. We have to remember that we can't get someone we love back by killing someone else. I think it's important to stress that people who commit terrible crimes should be punished, but that should be done using other punishments than death penalty for example lifetime punishment. One argument you often hear from people who are advocating death penalty is that it is much cheaper to execute a criminal than to keep him or her in prison for life. That is not true, though. It has been proved that the trial that precede a death penalty is much more expensive than a lifetime punishment. Even if the trials are very thorough there are still people who are not guilty that get judged. In the USA the majority of the prisoners convicted to death are black men who have lived their lives in poverty. Poor people can't afford the best lawyer and because of that they can be wrongfully convicted. The possibility to kill an innocent person is reason enough to be against death penalty. The Government can't pay back the loss it has caused the innocent person's family. In these cases there is just another victim and no problems has been solved. People that advocates death penalty maintain that the capital punishment keeps people away from committing crimes. This argument is not true either. In countries where they still have death penalty people commit higher amounts of serious crimes than in countries that don't have this punishment. I think that this fact proves that the capital punishment doesn't work as a deterrent. I think lifetime punishment is much better than death penalty. I advocate lifetime punishment because I don't think a victim or its relatives who might have been harassed by a criminal should fear that it could happen again. I also advocate this kind of punishment because if it appears that the person who is convicted is innocent, he or she will still be alive. Even if you can't pay back for years behind bars, the innocent person can live the rest of his life in freedom which you can't let a dead person do. I think the best thing a society could do is not to scare people away from committing crimes, but to prevent crime. As an example this could be done by developing a better and more equal school system. This is of course very expensive, but if we put an end to capital punishment I think we could afford it. It is not always easy to be against death penalty. When you hear about people who rape and kill innocent children it is easy to feel that this person deserves to die. I also think it's quite normal to feel this way, but I still don't think the Government can show us what we do wrong by doing exactly the same thing. There are many more arguments to take a stand against the capital punishment, but for me the three I have presented here are reasons enough to stop this cruel punishment.
EE377	1	﻿I've always been interested in different sorts of languages, but I think that english is the language that has been the most fun during my years in school. I must also say that all the teachers that I've had, have affected me in a very positive way. That might be the big reason to why I want to become an english teacher. I've always had enjoyable english lessons and I want my students to get the same experience as I've got. When I think of it, I don't think it is mainly the teachers that has affected me, wanting to learn some more about the language and how to use it. Through the years I've done some travelling, and I think its the excitement in wanting to get to know other people and cultures that has made me curious. Also when I look at all the yars that has passed, I find myself among all the other students, sitting listening to a lecture as it has been on swedish. I mean...its just such a feeling to know that the brain or whatever there is inside, can just switch from one langage to the other and we still respond in the same way. Maybe it sounds a bit fussy in the way I describe my feeling about it, but I think, or at least hope, that I have made myself understandable. That is by the way one of the things that I want to develop about myself. The way in how to make the right expressions. I think it is hard to find the right words when I'm talking, I often put myself in a position when I just simply loose the words. The thing is that it doesn't have to be very hard words, and that both annoys me at the same time as it makes me very frustrated because I feel in a way that I can't make myself heard in the way that I want to. Also I sometimes find myself a bit insecure wether I should make a point of view or not when I think something is wrong, just because I'm afraid that I can't find the words. Don't get me wrong when I say this, because I don't look at myself as a shy person. But maybe the explanation about this can be that It's easier to get into a new language just to listen, than to begin to speak. In one way I think that I learn something new everytime I speak english with someone else, but also everytime I go to a lecture or an english lesson. There's always a couple of words that are new to my ears. One of the best things that I've done, was to live in an english environment, where I was more or less forced to speak english every day, (if I didn't set up a meeting with a couple of my swedish friends of course). Then what did I do? Well, like many swedish girls do, I went abroad as an au pair. I fell for an advert in a swedish newspaper. And just for fun I answered it without expecting to get any response. Anyway, a couple of weeks after the family had responded, I found myself sitting in an aeroplane, heading for London, to where I had never been before. My stay in this wonderful city ended for six months, and I learned a lot about myself, english people, the culture and of course a lot about the language. This was a couple of yars ago, but since I was there I have tried more or less to keep the english langage alive with reading english books, newspapers and magazines, something which is very good practise. I've never had so much difficulties when it comes to writing, and I find grammar quite fun, but that is always something that I have to "dust off a bit". Nowadays we get so much free through all television, (and soap-operas unfortunately...) but I can't say anything bad about it, because when we live in such a country as we do, we have to get to know at least one more language to communicate with, and then I find english to be the most important, as it is spoken all over the world.$$$﻿ Is television good or bad for children? Does children know that everything on the television is not real? Can we blame television for being one of the reasons for the increasing violence in society? Sweden is one of the countries in the world that have a large amount of television programmes that turns directly to children. The programmes are both educational aswell as fictitious. It is a fact that children learns a lot through television. Through their own fantasy, their non-real world and through medias non-real worlds, the children learns how to experiment with different identities and conflicts. They learn how to play with these fantasies in their own game or in real life, nad through their own action they will meet love, encourage, disappointments or other reactions. Of course television is good for children to a certain level and just as long as they have an adult that can give them some sort of guidance through the programmes and at the same time give them explanations to different events. It is not the television that has the responsibility to raise the children. Unfortunally parents of today have no time for "quality time" with their children and as a result of that many children end up in front of the TV. There is a lot of talk about whether television should transfer incorrect valuations and inspire to harmful actions. Does children really know how to create their own identity? I think that their own safety and certainty has a determining factor to whom they will identify themselves with. I also think that the social background and differences in knowledge and experiences really does matter when they choose a person they like. Children needs to get impressions from outside when they creating an identity, but I don't think that they should get as many impressions through television as they do. Children didn't have any problems to find their identity when there was no television. I don't think that children knows how to separate fantasy from reality when they are watching TV on their own. At least not when they are at a young age. For them the TV is like a magic window that reduces something that happens in real life. Programmes of today are fast and every now and then there is a commercial break. I think that film and television for children nowadays doesn't have the educational quality that is supposed to provide them with knowledge for a longer time. As a result of the high tempo and all the commercial breaks, they are not able to reflect and attach to all the features. I don't want to say with this that I think that we should stop children from watching TV, but as it is today I think that the focusing on violence has increased even in programmes for children. Film and television shows us too often how to solve problems and conflicts with violence and this, I am sure, has led to why society looks in the way that it does today. Of course we cannot blame all the troubles on media, but I think that a lot of it comes from there. We all live in a very demanding society and nowadays more people wants a career, it is more important, and at the same time we have less time for our children. But if we then want to use media as a "babysitter", why don't the media adapt the programmes in a better way. I don't think that it is the people that should adapt themselves to the media, it is rather the reverse. To prevent children from watching non- approved programmes there should be some kind of age limit when it comes to renting videos that has a more violent caracter. What I want to say with this is that this is solely a way to protect our children from getting the wrong impressions of real life. Their knowledge in how to behave should come from parents, relatives and their teachers in the first hand. Television has become too fictitious and should come in the second hand when the children knows how to separate fantasy and reality.
EE278	0	﻿ ADOPTION TO GAY COUPLES? I recently saw a documentary about children in neglected orphan homes. It was really awful and they lived under circumstances that no child should live under. Soon after, I read an article about gay couples wanting to adopt children but was not allowed. This was all a bit confusing for me because why not let them adopt this children, who are in a desperate need of care and love when there are people who would be approved to adopt if it wasn't for their sexuality? It is a very difficult question to answer yes or no to right away, because there are many aspects that need to be looked at. The first question that I think you should take side on is weather gay people are "normal" people or not. I'm not gay myself, but I am not against it and I don't think that a love between two human beings can be wrong if both parts really feel it. Some might be against gay people and there existence for the reason that God did not create the human being to be together sexually with another person of the same gender. It is written in the bible that it is against our religion and Gods will. Those who use that as an objection I can in a way understand if they really are a strong believer and follow everything that are written in the bible, but do they? If not, I don't find their objection as a good reason to not accept gay people and just a sign of fear to what is not the most common thing. I could have a discussion only about this, what I think about people being gay, but that is not the issue. The really issue here is if gay people are as good as heterosexual people to bring up a child and if they should be allowed to adopt children. There are a lot of counterarguments to why they should not be allowed to adopt and that is why it is not allowed right now in Sweden. As I wrote above there are a religious aspect that has to be considered. Some countries that generally have a very strong belief in their religion would most probably not allow an adoption to a gay couple. In the same time there are countries that don't have such a strong belief and might accept it, but this is not really something that Sweden can do so much about and it is not a reason for not allowing gay couple to adopt. If you look at the other objections one of them is that a child needs both a male and a female figure in their life when they grow up. That might be true, I'm not an expert in the subject. In the same time there are a lot of children growing up without both gender by their side without taking too much damage, I think. Some have said that these children, who would be adopted by gay couples, would have a very strange time growing up and they would have problems to find their sexual identity. I think that is just prejudices and there are no really proofs to confirm that. I don't think that their childhood will be so strange and difficult compared to other children's. The only reason that I can think of why it should be strange, is that other people would make it more complicated then it really is, for example children mocking them in school etc., but that is really up to the other parents how they teach their children to treat others. y point of view to some of the objections to this question is that I'm aware of that it exist some reasons for not allowing gay couple to adopt children. In the same time I am, right now, convinced that it is a better solution then letting some orphan child being neglected and be let to grow up without any security in their life when they can come to a family that would love, care and help them to feel secure.$$$﻿I have always been one of these people who in most cases can hear what is the accurate thing to say or write, when using a foreign language, and have managed alright with that. I have now, however, reached a level of English when that is no longer possible for me. Though, having spent some time in English-speaking countries, I at least, consider myself to be fairly well aware of my strenghts and weaknesses in the English language. As, probably, most people who have been abroad my favourite part of the English language is the speaking part. Though, that does not mean that I have no difficulties talking. Something that I find quite disturbing, that many people might not see as a major problem, is that I have a very mixed accent. As Swedish is my mother tongue, of course, some of the problems with my English pronounciation, originates from that language. In school we were supposed to adopt the British English, but on the other side, most things on television are American. Most Swedish people of the younger generations tend to speak English with an American accent, so obviously television in Sweden has had a greater affect on Swedish people than school (,at least in this aspect). In 1997 I spent three months studying English in Dublin. At the end of my stay, my way of talking was quite influenced by the Irish accent. To make it worse, I last year went to work in Edinburgh. At that point a difficulty occurred; which accent should I make use of? Since I was in Scotland I, naturally, met a fair amount of Scottish people, but that was not all. Edinburgh is a University city, and people from all over the world, especially from England, go there to study. As a result of that most of my friends turned out to be English. What has happened is, that my accent has become a mixture between the Swedish, American, Irish, and English accent. I do not think I have picked up any of the Scottish accent, but however, I know for certain that I am prone to use some of the most common words in a Scottish persons vocabulary. Speaking is naturally in very close connection to listening, so that is something I have quite a lot of experience of too. From my point of view, the most difficult thing in listening to people speaking English are all the various dialects exist in the language. I do not want to generalise, and say that I, for instance, find the Scottish accent harder to understand than other English dialects. I merely think that I can say that some very local dialects, in every English-speaking country distinguish themselves to be less comprehensible for me than others. Before I went to Scotland, I had the image that all Scottish people were impossible to understand, and was rather surprised to find that the first Scottish people I made acquaintance with, were very easy to understand. On the other hand, I found most of the Scottish staff at the restaurant where I worked, next to impossible to comprehend. Although, I have had some practice, I still find many Scottish, English and other dialects hard to understand. There are also thousands of dialects that I have never even heard. So I think I just cannot listen enough. Another aspect on my ability to use the English language is of course the writing part. Many people drop to the conclusion that, just because I have a Cambridge exam in English (as a foreign language) I am also good at writing. That is however far from reality. The language course I went to did almost exclusively focus on exam practice, and accordingly, how to do that specific exam, was what I learned. The only really good thing was that my teacher focused very much on how to structure a text, and I believe that that is something I have been able to gain from. Something that I, on the other hand, feel very insecure of, when it comes to writing, is when to use commas, colon and semi-colon. At last, from the reading point of view. I have always been very fond of reading, but unfortuntely I have not read many books in English. The reason has simply been lack of time. However, before schoolwork started to take up too much of my time, I was a dedicated reader of Swedish literature. Although, that was a long time ago and in a different language, I still feel that I should have some use of it when now reading English literature. To round off, I would like to mention some general things that I think I need to work on. The most important thing for me, as I see it, is to regain and enlarge my knowledge of grammar. That includes not just advanced syntaxes, but also very basic things like when to use the gerund, and when to use which preposition. Another thing that I hope to accomplish with my studies is to broaden and increase my vocabulary. When you are living abroad, you normally learn words of the every-day language. Accordingly, what I would like to learn now, is words that you need, for example, when discussing literature, reading a newspaper, or listening to the news. As very final, I would like to say, that to learn more about different dialects, is something that for me is highly valued. Without generalising too much, I think I can say that there are some significant diversities in the language spoken in different English-speaking countries. To learn about those diversities, I believe, would be a great help in communicating with English-speaking people from all sorts of backgrounds.
EE372	0	﻿As all swedes in my generation, I have a long history of studying english. Despite quite good grades, it feels that it's been 6 years since I finished school. Over the last years, as a member of an international youth oranisation promoting peace education and cultural awareness, I've had a lot of practice in both speaking and listening to english. A lot of talking with people from all over the world, that has english as their only common language, has given me the opportunity to learn how to shift relatively easy between english and swedish. Most of the times I have no problems making myself understood. There has never been any prestige in finding the right words, so I'm a master of talking around things to make people understand what I want. The fact that it's mostly non native english speakers in this organisation has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage as I see it is that the accuracy isn't the best. The main thing has always been to be understood. The advantage, wich I find important to me as a person, is that I have no problems understanding what people say. I sometimes find it more difficult to understand native english speakers that has a dialect compared to other nationalities (except maybee for the Indians). Another thing that comes hand in hand with this lack of prestige, is that I have learned never to hesitate to ask again if there is something I haven't understood. As I recall it the english classes never had the emphasis on writing. Ever since I left school most of my writing has been limited to writing personal letters, and occasionally some more official texts in connection with this international organisation. As everyone else, I've learned grammar at school, but now I feel that I have forgotten most of it, so that's an area I'll have to put emphasis on now. The rules of grammar has never been transfered from sentences to longer texts, so that I have to discover the tools for working with. I also feel that I need to improve my spelling. Reading in english is something I've enjoyed doing for quite some time now, but it's not something I've done regulary. It has come as a naturall continuence from reading a lot in swedish. The litterature has gradually become more difficult, but I still haven't worked up any speed in my reading, and summary reading is only possible in very simple texts. When reading books I've always been more interested in the context rather than specific words. Today I feel this hasen't promoted the developement of my vocabulary. I hope this course will give me a wider vocabulary as well as a higer accuracy in my writing. Since all the litterature is in english, it will naturally help my reading skills. The listening part, as well as the speaking, is practised every day, wich makes it come very natural. I think that is a good way of improving a language.$$$﻿I used to think that since I had no problems understanding written or spoken English and furthermore had no real problems communicating my own thoughts and ideas using this, my second language, I was in no need of further studies in this particular field. Now I see that this was nothing more than a rather ignorant and indeed also quite smug thought. Today I am aware of both my strengths and my weaknesses when it comes to English. Obviously the weaknesses are a bit more depressing to ponder on, but nonetheless I feel that they are more important for me to be aware of than my strengths, for reasons that I will state further on. Let us instead begin with the bright sides of my skills in English. As I began studying literature at the university, my personal interest for English literature grew and I soon began to noticed that my English wasn't good enough to make the detailed text analyses I wanted to do. However my English has improved considerably since then, due to a massive exposure to written and spoken English. I have no problems understanding the meaning of a written text in English as long as it doesn't deal with a highly specialised field to which I am not familiar. Neither do I find it very hard to understand spoken English. Though I must confess that travelling around the Irish countryside gave me considerable doubts about whether I really had any capability at all to understand spoken English. Malicious rumours probably claim that any problems I might have with listening to and understanding English lies in the simple fact that I am a bad listener whatever language I'm being addressed with. I repel such suggestions strongly. When it comes to my own use of English I find, as stated above, that I have no big problems communicating with English-speaking people. I have no fears whatsoever for ever finding myself in a situation where I can't make myself understood in English. The grammar may not be perfect or even tolerable, but still I feel confident that the meaning of my grammatically incorrect inarticulate sounds will get across to whomever I'm talking to. After all the ability of making oneself understood in any case of emergency must be the primary goal when learning another language at a very basic level. So far my strengths while it comes to my skills in English at a basic level. Let us move on to my weaknesses. I mentioned earlier that I felt that my English simply wasn't good enough when I began studying at the University. As I have a great interest in English literature I wanted to apply my brand new skills at interpreting and analysing literary texts on the works I loved. Much to my disappointment I found that I was in a sense handicapped. I didn't have that good ear for the language that you so desperately need to determine the true value of words, and to be able to find the subtle differences of meaning. This is something that is crucial when analysing literary works, and indeed also spoken English in detail. I still suffer from this handicap and I hope that I will be able to improve my ear for the language soon. Another weakness that asserts itself when I write and speak English is my lacking grammatical knowledge. Most of the times I probably use the right forms, but then again most of those times I have no idea whatsoever why I chose the form I did. I used to think that this wasn't really important, but now I realise that this is something that you simply have to know if you want to get a deeper understanding of the language. Finally, I just want to return to what I said about the importance of knowing ones weaknesses rather than ones strengths. The main reason for focusing on weaknesses is of course that if you want to get better at something, in this case understanding and using English, you will inevitably have to work hardest on your weak spots. There is no other way. However you shouldn't forget your strengths, because they are what keeps you going when you feel that your weaknesses threatens to overpower you.
EE275	1	﻿ George Abbot - one of a kind George Abbot is one of the characters in David Malouf's Remembering Babylon. He is a nineteen year old schoolmaster who doesn't really trust people after he has been let down by his godfather. The result of this is that he likes to be alone and has become isolated. When we first get to meet George Abbot (p.16) he seems to be an ordinary man at the age of thirty or thirty-five. The way he behaves in the company of other grown up people and how strict he is towards one of his students gives him this age in the reader's mind. After a few pages we are told that he is only nineteen years old and all of a sudden he is a totally different person. And when he starts to dream away through the window instead of concentrating on the people he was talking to, it seems as that he is not happy with his life, that he wants something else, far away from where he is now. As a schoolmaster George Abbot is strict and wants the full attention from his pupils. If one of them dreams away, the same way he does himself sometimes, he flings a piece of chalk at he pupil's head. He doesn't want to be mean to them but sometimes he loses his temper just to hide the disappointment about his own life. Once he beats them all with the ruler because they haven't done their homework satisfactory and immediately afterwards he feels good about it, but when he sees them hold back their tears he wants to cry with them (p.46). George Abbot was once a self-confident child with a charming manner. He grew up without a father and his rich godfather, Mr Robertson, paid for his education. George used to spend Easter and Michaelmas at the godfather's big house and was the servants' favourite. He charmed all the visitors at the house and Mr Robertson was proud of him. But George grew older and people didn't seem to notice him anymore. He tried his old tricks to charm them but everybody just said it was inappropriate for a boy at his age. Mr Robertson too didn't care anymore and George never really understood what had happened. He became bitter and had to fight hard not to end up in a state of permanent anger or become morose. Mr Robertson kept paying for the boy's education but George didn't visit the big house anymore. A few years later George returned to his godfather. He had once been promised a place to stay and now he wanted such that place. At first he didn't plan to tell the godfather about his dreams, about Africa, but Mr Robertson seemed so happy to see him so George confided in him. He thought that maybe the man would understand. But once again the godfather let him down and instead of understanding he gave George the suggestion to go to Australia, a country full of possibilities (p.50). George didn't want to go there but he did and became a schoolmaster. Marked by the godfather's treacheries he didn't dare to act like a youth anymore. It was inappropriate he had once learned so he started acting as an older man and let people think he was twenty-six or seven instead of nineteen. In Australia George Abbot is lonely and people don't really know who he is. He likes to be alone and usually spends the afternoons outside with a book. With no one around and with the book in his hands he can escape from his other "I", the schoolmaster, the misunderstood and lonely George Abbot. With the words in the book he escapes from reality and enters another world where he is loved and everything is easy. Even though George Abbot is very isolated from the rest of the people around him he hasn't really noticed it himself. Not until he, by accident, ends up in Mrs Hutchence's house and finds himself in the middle of a conversation with other young people (p.86 and forward). The mysterious Leona and seventeen years old Hector who would do anything to get her attention. They are both clean and civilised and know how to make the conversation interesting while George is dirty with wild hair and doesn't really know what to say. He feels like a savage in their company. Suddenly he realizes how isolated he has been and how nice it is to be around other people. He starts to open up and gives the others a chance to appreciate him being there. The event at Mrs Hutchence's house is a rebirth for George and he starts to look at the world from another point of view. He can accept the fact that he is a schoolteacher in a country he never meant to go to and that not all people want to hurt him. Maybe he will never come to Africa but as long as he keeps on dreaming everything is possible.$$$﻿ "The only good Indian is a dead Indian." There were many different ways to look at the American Indians. Many people were scared of them while some people were Indian friends. The many Indian wars made people hate the Indians because they killed whites, when in fact it was because of the white man's hunger for more land the wars were started at first. Elizabeth Custer stands for the first attitude to the American Indians. She was married to general George Custer who got killed during the battle at Little Big Horn in 1876. According to Elizabeth, George Custer was a great friend of the Indians and they came to him for advice in certain questions. Custer's office was filled up by Indians and they always smoked the pipe together. Elizabeth admired the Indian clothes and described the Indians in detail in her book "Boots and saddles". But at the same time she detested them. Every time she saw them she thought of the Indians that killed an unarmed white man. The man got shot when he was riding his horse but didn't die immediately so when he fell off his horse, one of the Indians "beat out the last breath left" of the man. Then, when the man was already dead, the same Indian shot his body full of arrows. Another white man came out of the bushes holding up his hands in peace and also gave the Indians his hat, another sign for peace, but the Indians shot him. At first with their guns and then with arrows. This incident had got caught in Elizabeth's mind and every time she saw the Indians she kept thinking of how they could do such a thing. She thought the Indians were savages which couldn't hold their temper and admired her husband George for his patience with them. Elizabeth Custer's attitude to American Indians can be summarized by two things: she enjoyed looking at their beauty and their clothes but at the same time she didn't trust them because of an event that might not even have taken place. Another attitude to American Indians is the Uncapapa Indian chief Sitting Bull's attitude. He was a great chief and medicine man in the Sioux tribe (Uncapapa is a branch within the Sioux tribe). In an interview he talks about his people and about being the one he is. All the Indians want is to live in peace. They were not born to fight against the white people, but when they are not allowed to keep their land they have to fight for it. They didn't choose to live side by side with the whites so they cannot really accept it. When Sitting Bull tells about how he became the great man he is, it's not difficult to understand why Indians and whites don't understand each other. He started study the world and his people before he was even born. Still inside his mother's belly he learned about medicine and the God Almighty told him to be the judge of his people, to decide for them and lead their way. When he trades with the whites he wants a fair deal and cannot understand why the whites want to give little and get much. And when he doesn't accept their offer they say that they will make the government fight him. This is not the Indian way so Sitting Bull doesn't want to trade with the whites anymore. When Sitting Bull talks about the whites it's obvious that it's not the Indians that are savages. It's the white people. Another example is why to hunt buffaloes. The American Indians hunt because they need food and clothes. They kill as many buffaloes as they need and leave the others for next time. White men don't need to hunt buffaloes. They kill for fun and leave the dead body without using it, they just remove the horns as a trophy. In the interview Sitting Bull also talks about the battle at Little Big Horn and how it really happened. At least how it happened through Indian eyes. No one can say if he really told the truth but he told about what he saw, his truth. He didn't make things up just to look more brave or put all the blame of what happened on the whites. That is something a white person could do but never an Indian. A third attitude to American Indians is the one Judson E. Walker describes. He thinks it's an honour to present the great Sioux chief Sitting Bull, a savage that always left blood behind. The Indians killed to feed their hunger for blood and didn't care if the victims were innocent people. They plundered the whites and anyone who came in their way had to pay with his life. When Sitting Bull and his people moved to Canada there were no fights for a whole year, but it didn't last long. The Indians began to plunder again and the authorities had to figure out how to protect the innocent white settlers. It's difficult to draw a conclusion out of this but one way could be that the Indians were forced to become savages. The white people came and took their land, forced them to live in reservations. The Indians tried to live in peace but the whites continued to take their land and when they couldn't have it they called the Indians savages and tried to kill them. When the Indians realized that they could not live in peace with the whites they did the opposite. They killed to save their own race. For a long, long time they had lived in peace with the nature and one day the whites came and destroyed it all. The whites kept pushing the limits and when the Indians couldn't take it anymore they fought for their existence, and their future. When it comes to saving the future anyone can become a savage, anyone.
EE273	0	﻿ My strengths and weaknesses in the English language Ten years after finishing high school, I am now to study English again. This time on a much higher level. It is time to evaluate what my strengths and weaknesses are. Listening In general I'm a good listener. For instance, while listening to a lecturer, I don't have a problem to focus on what is being said (unless the person I'm listening to makes the subject really boring, or when I'm very tired), and I usually understand the lot. My weakness is my small vocabulary. I think I scored about average on the diagnostic test I took on vocabulary. Since I did a lot of guessing, picking out the right words, it is reasonable to assume that my vocabulary is even below average. I enjoy watching English movies and I pick up on the language just by listening to it when I make the effort not to look at the subtitles. And of course by reading, which is what the next part in this essay is about. Reading I like to read novels for the fun of it, but also other sorts of literature about various kinds of matters. Therefore I believe the literature course and the social studies will be easier for me than other courses. My weakness in this course is, once again, my lack of vocabulary. It slows down my reading a great deal, but the pace will increase the more I read, as well as my vocabulary. I think I'm fairly good when it comes to interpreting novels, short stories and poems. My strengths are the fact that I enjoy reading and that I usually understand the content, irony and humour. Speaking y strength when it comes to speaking English is that I'm not afraid to make mistakes. I'm here to learn and of course I'm not perfect from the start. Moreover, I believe that my speaking ability will improve rather quickly once I start practising on a daily basis. I find the rhythm of the language and the accent, more difficult to learn than the pronunciation is. I am very rusty though, I haven't spoken English since high school, like I said, and then it was almost just about answering questions. The problem is that there is a limitation to what I can talk about with my present vocabulary, and that I don't have the right intonation. Writing y writing skills are very difficult to evaluate; I don't really know what my strengths and weaknesses are. I know that I can't be that good at it, since my vocabulary is limited and my knowledge in grammar is bad. I think that grammar is very tricky, it is probably my number one weakness. I have some advantage though, since I studied Swedish grammar last year. My ability to focus on a subject is fairly good, but it can become better. I've written a lot in Swedish and maybe that is also an advantage to some extent. I find it rather difficult to write this essay and I imagine it will be even harder when I have an intricate subject to write about. My strength would be my ambition to learn and trying to get it right. Conlusion To bring this essay to an end, I will now summarise my different strengths and weaknesses in the English language. My lack of vocabulary has a negative effect on all parts of the language. My difficulty with grammar naturally has a negative effect when it comes to writing and in some ways speaking. (Needless to say it will give me a lot of work at the grammar course). I am not accustomed to speaking English, which of course will make it difficult from the beginning. My strengths are my faculty to learn languages and my ambition to do so. I hope that I will be able to transfer my writing skills in Swedish to my writing in English. My interest in reading will help me through the continuous work increasing my vocabulary, as my general interest in English will help me through all courses.$$$﻿To evaluate yourself is never easy, especially not your strengths. I tend to see my weaknesses much easier. That is why I see this essay as a bit of a challenge. I'm going to assess both my strengths and my weaknesses in the four skills of speaking, reading, listening and writing the English language. I think it is great that there is a language like English spoken in so many countries around the world. It is fantastic to travel almost to the other side of the world and still being able to speak with the people you meet. I have relatives that live in Barbados, West Indies, and sometimes I think about how it would be if I couldn't speak English. Awful, yes, it is very good to feel that they understand what I'm trying to say and to be able to tell them things about Sweden and so on. It is also good to find that you know the English word for something that you didn't think you knew. But I find it very hard to be spontaneous and funny in English. I worry too much about what I'm going to say and if it is going to come out correct. Because of that I think that people, English-speaking, doesn't really get to know the real me: a quite spontaneous and funny young woman but a quiet and dull young woman. I'm working on it though, and hopefully this term is going to make a big difference for me when it comes to speak more fluently and to get more self-confidence. Before I began to study at the institute of education I can't really remember reading any English books. Naturally I've read English texts and short stories but I don't think I've ever read a whole book. Consequently, my first exam was a big change for me. I had to read an English thick book titled Educational psychology and really understand and learn the contents. My result on that first exam was luckily gratifying and I felt really satisfied with myself for that accomplishment. I can't say that I've read many English books since then, but some course books have been in English and I was obliged to read those. At first it was very time-wasting to look up words in a dictionary but after a while I noticed that I often understood the word from the context. That discovery made a big difference and made my English reading much more efficiently and above all more fun. To read imaginative literature like Nice work by David Lodge is really fun and I liked that book very much. A reason why I liked it was that I thought it would be more difficult to read than it was and that helped to raise my self-confidence and made me look forward to start read the next book on the list for the literature course. I watch much TV, too much actually. But I defend myself with the fact that it helps me improve my English, because most of the films and TV-series are in English. They are of course subtitled, but I try to listen to the spoken English as well because otherwise you tend to miss jokes and other things that you can't translate to Swedish. When I visit my relatives in the West Indies, I think that I understand everything they say. If someone says a word that I don't recognize I can usually guess the meaning of it by the situation. However, my relatives speak English with a British accent that makes it really easy to catch what they are saying. The Bajan accent on the other hand, which most of the people on Barbados speak, is surprisingly hard to catch. You have to exert yourself to hear what they are saying. I think that different English accents will be easier to understand as my English improves. At this point I don't feel very competent about writing in English because it was a long time since I did. Of course I've been writing short E-mails to my relatives in Barbados but that is nothing compare to essays and similar things. My spelling is quite good but it's my grammar that worries me. I didn't need the diagnostic test to tell me that. I also think that I still translate the Swedish in my head and that sometimes makes the wordorder inverted. I'm quite sure that this term and especially the writing course is going to help me improve my writing skills. The most important thing for me about the English language is to be able to communicate with people. To listen and understand and to make myself under-stood by correct pronunciation. I know that I can manage those two skills quite good, but I want to get even better! I want to be able to be spontaneous and speak fluently with my relatives and other people. Above all I want to be a good teacher, and teach my students to communicate in English. I'm sure that I have every chance of succeeding, but I'm fully aware of the fact that I'm going to have to work really hard!
EE483	1	﻿ Educating the audience In this essay I will argue in favour of the TV-programmes that have an educational value and encourage the viewer too seek new knowledge. The large extent of channels offer in as many ways different kinds of entertainment but few can actually offer us programmes that enable the viewers to learn something useful. What I am pointing towards are the documentaries and nature programmes that give us new valuable knowledge. When studying the TV-guide closely you come across very few nature programmes or documentaries. Instead, the table features channels and programmes with continuous game shows, sit-coms and talk shows that clearly lack an educational value apart from their less well-represented cousins. The various sit-coms and talk shows are perfectly suited for the viewers who seek little intellectual stimulation. The brain activity drops to zero. On the contrary, nature programmes embark on inspiring and interesting journeys that take us to all corners of the world seeking knowledge about exotic animals and places not accessible to you and me. Fantastic colourful pictures of rare plants and species, small insects in amazing close-up photography and a majestic portrait of a female lion on the savanna of Africa stand in huge contrast to the living room based sit-coms and soap operas. The main purpose that nature programmes have is to help us explore our planet and to give us knowledge about different parts of the world. Whether it is about an animal, a forest or a tribe in Africa it helps us to broaden our horizons and get an idea of how life can be for humans or animals in different places of the planet. We can call it a living room globalisation. The documentary is the other sort of TV-programme that has an educational value. They come in many different ways as in-depth stories on current events, historical reviews or investigative reports on different matters in society. The daily news broadcasts sometimes fail to give the complete picture of a news item due to the lack of time. The documentary can in this situation follow up on the topic and give more in-depth stories and thorough analyses of current events. Documentaries and nature programmes are the sort of programmes that offer the viewers a chance to learn by watching, an opportunity to learn something new instead of watching a TV series that does not contribute with anything of importance. Surely, all kinds of entertainment on TV have a special meaning to everyone but its main purpose is simply to entertain for a short period of time. The question is what we get out of it except for a few laughs or a moment of excitement for some contestant trying to win the big bucks. Television has, however, taken its responsibility in an effort to try educating their audience as well. By showing documentaries of all kinds and nature programmes we get a doze of useful and stimulating entertainment. As a contrast to the various forms of soap operas, sit-coms and talk shows where the viewers' minds are inactivated due to lack of meaningful contents the documentaries have something valuable to offer. Firstly, documentaries almost always want to tell us something. Most often they have a message that needs to be told in order to awake a public awareness on a burning issue such as a threat of decease or a hostile situation somewhere in the world. Secondly, historical documentaries are important in order for us to see how we can learn from history and how it has shaped the world of today. As a conclusion I would like to point out that the documentaries and nature programmes that are shown on TV have the most educational value. In contrast to the game shows, sit-coms and other sorts of entertainment on TV they contribute to give new knowledge and insight into different issues. Documentaries give for example the whole picture of a news item and tries through thorough investigation to find the underlying problems while nature programmes help us to explore the planet we live on.$$$﻿ A modern monarchy Sweden has been a monarchy for a very long time. In fact, our history is to a large extent connected with the different kings and queens that have ruled the country. Even though the boundaries have changed several times due to wars, conflicts and unions our monarchy has persevered. The role of the monarch has however seen a huge transformation over the last two hundred years and the powers of Gustav II Adolf or Karl XII cannot be compared with those of the present king Carl XIV Gustav. The parliament is today the main legislative and ruling body with the government being the second with the Supreme Court being separated from political influence. It does not deal with political matters or interfere with the laws passed by the parliament. The powers listed above all belonged to the monarch a little longer than two hundred years ago. The king or queen was the lawmaker, commander of the armed forces and the main ruler of the nation. Swedish kings are famous of their warfare with neighbouring counties and battles throughout northern Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, however, the situation is completely different today where the monarch's powers have been reduced to none as a consequence of the parliamentary movements of the 19th century. In 1809, the first reform took place when dissatisfied generals set the king aside and the monarch's powers were reduced and shared with different ruling bodies. Fifty years later a reform was passed that changed the foundation of the class-based parliament to a parliament based on income and property. The monarch's power was not changed dramatically during these years but a process had started that would eventually relieve the monarch of his former duties. The new form of government had come to grow strong and it was now the parliament that became the new ruling body in domestic and international matters. As the parliament took over the responsibility of ruling the country it was expected of the monarch to stay neutral and not to express himself in political matters. Despite this fact king Gustav V chose in 1914 not to agree with the existing prime minister, as a result of this controversy the prime minister resigned. Since then there have been no further utterances in political matters form the monarch and we expect the him to keep a low profile, even in non-political matters even though it is claimed by some people that the present king and queen are strong leaders of opinion in different matters such as hunting and child-pornography. The king and queen of Sweden are today merely representatives of the country who appear on official state visits and also travel around the world creating good relations with other countries and putting Sweden on the map. There is no power at all to talk about and the monarch simply receives a salary that will enable him to carry out his duties as a representative of our country. The opposition, the critics of the monarchy, claim that it is old-fashioned and not equivalent with the modern society and also that it is expensive for the taxpayers. I don't find this sort of criticism very well considered. Firstly, Sweden is a very old country and the monarchy is a big part of our history as well as our identity. I think it is quite unique living in a country where we still have a monarchy because there are not many countries that are monarchies today. When it comes to the question of democracy and the modern day society the monarch does not have any political power as seen above, all those powers have been taken away from the monarch and been put in the hands of the people. This fact shows henceforth that a monarchy really can exist within the boundaries of a modern democracy. Secondly, the argument saying that it is expensive to uphold and support the royal family's living expenses does not seem to hold ground. Compared to other expenses it is a very small fraction of the tax money that is paid. Repairing or rebuilding the monarch's residences would add up to a big sum of money up front but it is hardly noticeable in the big economy and besides we pay so much taxes in this country that you would not be able to see the difference. Thirdly, and as a final thought, if we were to abolish the monarchy in Sweden, what would the tabloids write about?
EE281	1	﻿ Irresponsible spongers lost in an illusion of happiness I am convinced that every human being dreams about happiness, about living a happy life. But what is happiness after all? What is a happy life? It is impossible to find just one right answer to these questions. As in Doris Lessing's book "The Fifth Child" all the characters are looking after happiness in different ways due to their own ideas of what happiness and a happy life is all about and how they can achieve it. But whatever ideas of the happiness we might have and however we are trying to attain it in our lives we will always be responsible for our acts. In my opinion the main theme of Doris Lessing's book "The Fifth Child" involves a lack of responsibility, and even a downright irresponsibility, that to my mind follows throughout the whole story. It appears mainly in the main characters, Harriet and David, and in their acts but to some extent in all the characters. They are all so anxious to find happiness, to be happy, that they ignore any consequences of their acts. For example Harriet and David think that the key to happiness is to set up a big family with a proper home and they realise this dream of them very stubbornly without taking responsibility for the consequences but in many ways throwing it on the other characters. Setting of the story is very relevant to the theme. A starting-point is Harriet and David's own backgrounds that affect their opinions and ideas. Harriet is brought up by parents who "had taken it for granted that family life was the basis for a happy one" (12). David, on the other hand, is a divorce child whose childhood home consisted of two rooms, one at his mother's and one at his father's. That is why David's idea of a happy life contains a family with a decent home where, according to David, "'it's important,' ..., 'everybody should have a room'" (31). His children will get everything he didn't. Harriet and David's first step towards a happy family life is to buy a house, "Full of space for children ... they meant to have a lot of children." (13). The house they buy is a very large one that they actually can't afford. "Even with David's quite decent salary, and Harriet's, the mortgage of this house would be beyond them. But they would manage somehow." (14) They begin to live a life that they simply impossible can afford. "And how was all this paid for? ...people knew David's father was rich. Without that mortgage being paid for, none of this could have happened." (27) Harriet and David don't take the economic responsibility for their lifestyle but throw it on David's well-to-do father. Temporally the story takes place in 1960-80'. A distinctive feature for the sixties and seventies is the sexual revolution. Concerning Harriet and David's attitude to sex they stand out from the rest by opposing the sexual freedom and questioning contraceptives. Because of their differing opinions they are considered as oddballs. "As for Harriet, she was a virgin. 'A virgin now,' her girl friends might shriek; 'are you crazy?'" (9) "..., 'I am sorry, I don't like all this sleeping around, it's not for me.'" (10) In spite of Harriet and David's attitude towards sex and their plans to wait two years before having children they still begin to have sex like "rabbits", ignoring any consequences. It is only afterwards Harriet is a little bit worried: "'And how are we going to pay for it all if I am pregnant?'" (16) Even if they seem to be aware of the big responsibility that comes with children, both for their upbringing and maintenance, they evade it. Economically they still rely on David's father and they take for granted that Harriet's mother helps with children and household. "...for if family life was what they had chosen, then it followed that Dorothy should come indefinitely to help Harriet, ..." (20). In realising they dream of a happy family without taking responsibility for anything Harriet and David build their life on sand. They shut themselves up in their house and even if the world around them changes, and brutal incidents and crimes becomes commonplace in their neibourghoods (29), Lovatt's family lives in their own little, happy world. They create an idyll far from "the storms of the world" (29), far from reality. "The young Lovatts made themselves read the papers, and watch the News on television, ...to know what went on outside their fortress, their kingdom, ...safety, comfort, kindness." (30) However, when Harriet and David's fifth child Ben is born their perfect castle in the air is suddenly threaten by the reality and it starts to get cracks. In continuing to throw responsibility on other people they do themselves a disservice. Their happy life begins to break down when people that their whole life depends on turn aside one by one because the responsibility simply becomes too big for them to bear. Everything collapses when David's father stops paying for their house and living, when Harriet's mother leaves the house and finally when John, a young boy who Harriet engages to take care of Ben, leaves the town. Their happy family is totally fallen apart. Ben is left to his fate and various relatives answer all the other children. Harriet and David don't take the responsibility for their dream not coming true but again throw it on the others and, although they seem to know that they lived their life, their dream, like spongers on the others' expense, they still defend themselves with bad luck. "We took the responsibility for what we believed in, and we did it. Then -bad luck. That's all. We could easily have succeeded. We could have had just what we planned. Eight children in this house and everyone happy ... And who paid for it?" (142) Eventually they are even forced to sell their house -the true home of happiness. In my opinion Doris Lessing's novel is a warning to all of us. As I said before, whatever we regard as happiness and however we might try to reach it, responsibility is something we sooner or later have to take. If we don't take it we run a risk that our happy lives turn out to be just an illusion and instead of happiness we might end up living in a total misery.$$$﻿ TV violence's influence on children Violence on TV and its influence on children have presumably been matters of concern ever since TV was invented. Throughout the decades this issue has come up again and again. Last time, in the end of 20th century, violence on TV was brought up in connection with the conflicts in some American schools where children opened fire on other children and teachers, and also with the cases in Europe and Scandinavia in which small children were killed by other children. But does TV really have such a powerful influence on children that might lead to such unimaginable, terrible acts as to kill another human being? And if it has such an influence is there anything we can do about it? According to many studies children experience and react to violence on TV in very various ways. Some children might get upset, shocked, frightened and stressed whereas other children might experience the violence entertaining, get excited and get used to it. The majority of adults believe that TV violence affects children in one way or another. However, research of the matter in question shows that violence on TV is not the main reason for increase of violence among children although it is a thing that contributes. Even though we can't entirely blame TV violence for the horrible incidents that have happened it is still important to pay attention to the influence TV has because it is, however, a factor that we can do something about. But, because there is no way for parents to control everything what their children are watching on TV and the broadcasters are most likely not going to reduce violence in their programs, the question is: what are we able to do? I believe that we would achieve nothing by trying to exclude children from all possible violence on TV. First of all it is impossible and secondly children would anyway meet violence, generally speaking everywhere, because, whether we like it or not, violence is and has always been a part of our reality. The only constructive solution in my opinion is to give children more information about TV, how the different kinds of programs are made and how they use a lot of tricks in films and series. Above all, children must be taught the difference between fact and fiction. In fiction violence tends to be excessively exaggerated and consequences, if any, are often nonexistent or far from reality. We have to make sure that children understand that even if the Ninja Turtles can be shot many times and still be alive, the consequences of the same action in reality would be totally different. I believe that schools have a very important role in informing children about TV and violence, in teaching them to estimate and select and, on the whole, to handle the tremendous amount of information that they get from TV. The most effective way for schools to do that, in my opinion, would be to introduce instruction in media. I think that even the broadcasters should take their share of the responsibility. Quite a lot depends on their own moral, that they make up rules for themselves for example concerning how much and what kind of violence they show at the time when children most likely watch TV. Above all, they should not misrepresent the consequences of the violence on TV, but to show the real ones. . In my opinion the biggest responsibility of giving children the education on these matters is still vested in parents. It is important that they discuss, both the realistic and the fiction violence and also their consequences, with their children, that they work up together any fears or suspense that children might have due to TV violence. In that way they would build up children's consciousness of the real consequences of the violent acts and further their basic values about what is right and wrong. Most people believe that violence on TV affects children somehow. I think that TV can have both good and bad influence on children mostly due to their ability to handle the information that they get from TV. It is schools', broadcasters' and, above all, parents' responsibility to make sure that children learn the difference between fact and fiction, that they get aware of the real consequences of violent acts, and to build up their sense of right and wrong. It is very important that children learn critically to estimate and select all the material they get from TV.
EE165	0	﻿ "The Swedish people are decreasing their meat consumption" During the last decade, more and more people have stopped eating meat from cows and cattle. This development has taken place in a short period of time and can be read about almost every day in the newspapers. Statistics show that about 20 % of the Swedish people avoid eating meat from cows and turn to other alternatives instead; for example a vegetarian diet. This development has also occurred in the Swedish schools. In the upper-secondary schools the pupils who choose to eat vegetarian food have increased from 5% to 11 % in the last five years and most of them are girls. The decreased meat consumption worries the meat producers and others who make a profit from it, like farmers. How come the Swedish people, with a majority of young people, have started to avoid meat and especially the meat from cows? In this paper I will discuss the most reasonable causes behind this trend and finally I will give a conclusion. Today many people choose to eat food that is composed in special ways. Some choose to eat functional food that has the same effect as medicines, while other eat food that has been cultivated in certain ways. An example of this is eggs that come from hens that live a good life and do not live crowded in small areas, which was a common fact some years ago. To eat the right food has become a kind of fashion in our society, a way of telling people who you are. This new awareness of what is healthy has developed from the high demands that the society has raised on the Swedish people. You should look good and the body is for some, especially women and young girls, like a piece of art that one should design. To reach the goal of looking good, one has to have a healthy lifestyle, which includes eating healthy. Many have turned to believe that meat is not healthy and links it with death, slaughter and blood. According to the statistics in this new health society, meat has been placed on top of the list of food that people find unhealthy and often stop to eat. Some people connect it with heart diseases and hardening of the arteries. Foods like fish, chicken and vegetables have become popular alternatives to the meat. Another obvious reason for the decreased meat consumption in Sweden is the fact that the media and even politicians have started to make people aware of the cruel methods that are used when slaughtering animals, especially cows. Horrifying and upsetting pictures have been shown on television and new information about how the animals are bred has reached the Swedish people. People have been informed of the fact that hormones are sometimes used when breeding cows, in order to make them as big as possible before the slaughter. Many have become upset and have started to react against the cruel methods, especially the people who are struggling for the right of the animals. Furthermore, Swedish politics have lately been dealing with questions about how the animals are treated during slaughter and breeding and the Swedish prime minister recently made a speech in which he recommended the people to follow his advice and eat less meat. This speech got a lot of attention and could be read about in newspapers. It was welcomed especially by the organisations that are fighting for the animals. One of the Swedish newspapers made not long after the speech of the prime minister a questioning in which they asked the people if they were willing to stop eating meat. The outcome of the questioning was that 35 % said that they were willing to stop eating meat from cows. A reason behind this high percentage is the great impact that media has got on people in our country. People become affected from what the media reveals and its influence leads to my main cause. Lately, Swedish scientists and experts have made statements in television and newspapers about the likely relationship between BSE (Bovine Spongiform Eneephalopathy) and Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease. BSE is a slowly, progressive and ultimately fatal neurological disorder of cattle, while Jakob Creutzfeldt Disease is the human correspondence to it, a transmissible and progressive neurological disease resulting from infection. Sickness and diseases in all kinds have always frightened and worried people, and it is from this fear my main cause to why people have stopped eating meat has developed. People want answers and the question whether the BSE is connected with the human disease Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease is not yet answered. More and more cases of cows that are infected with the BSE virus are found every week in Europe and even if no cases are found in Sweden, people are worried. As a reaction many choose to avoid eating meat rather than risk getting ill. As long as no clear answers are given whether the BSE is connected with the Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease or not, the percentage of people who choose to stop eating meat will increase. The methods that are used when slaughtering and breeding in Sweden have to be improved so they will be less painful for the animals; otherwise more people are going to avoid eating meat as a protest.$$$﻿ IT IS ALL ABOUT MONEY In a debate-article from the Swedish newspaper DN, a Swedish political party Folkpartiet presents a new program where they give examples of how to make the Swedish school more effective, and how to make it the best school in Europe. One of their proposals is to add an extra year to the nine-year compulsory school. In this essay I will respond to the article on this stance and discuss this proposal further. Folkpartiet suggests an extra compulsory year in school, and this to make it possible for a larger number of pupils to graduate with a G, equivalent with a pass in the English school-system, in at least the three basic subjects; Swedish, English and Mathematics. It is difficult to take a clear stand to this issue because it has never been practised in the Swedish school-system before. Nevertheless it is an interesting thought. We see and hear daily reports about the decline of the school, and that it does not reach the standard it had a decade ago compared to other schools in Europe. An extra year in school might improve the general knowledge for each student, but there is another angle of this proposal. I believe that the quality of the school today has sunk, not because of lack of interest from the students but, because of great economy measures which have been done during the last ten years. Adding an extra year to the nine-year compulsory school would cost a lot of money, and if it is possible to procure this large sum of money I would rather use them in the existing school-system. Efficiency is reached when things are working very smoothly and with extra money it is a lot easier to get a hold of the existing problems. The problems will be solved by using the extra resources, for instance auxiliary teachers, whose number must e increased on each level. Several auxiliary teachers were standard in Sweden before the economy cuts. Pupils with problems should get help faster and there should be an investigation to clarify the cause of the problem and also what measures that has to be taken for each pupil who has a problem. Specialist teachers would then be able to concentrate on their own subject instead of playing the role of nurse, school welfare officer, or extra father or mother. This distribution of work and responsibility would make it possible for the students to develop both physically and mentally. It is also important to have in mind that pupils with problems are not the only ones that need extra support or extra resources. I believe that clever students also need support to keep up their good work and to continue with their development. If talented students are not encouraged to keep searching for information and knowledge they might stagnate in their learning-process. According to me, an extra compulsory year with general subjects and no specialisation for smart students would rather have a restraining effect than a strengthening one. The Swedish Folkpartiet emphasizes the importance of efficiency, progress and extra help for students who require special treatment. To make this work they argue for a ten-year compulsory school. In this case I would say that, if they have a concrete plan of how to procure the needed money for this project, the problem with the inefficiency of the Swedish school is solved, and this without even adding an extra year. With money it is easy to employ the extra needed resources, with money it is no problem to create a nice environment for the pupils, and with money the quality of the school will increase. It is easy for politicians and people in general to complain and it is just as easy to come with proposals, but not to realise them. The biggest mistake ever done, of which we now see a result, was the reduction of school-economy.
EE166	0	﻿ Capital Punishment In my essay I would like to argue about, if a person or the authority of a state has the right to decide weather a criminal should be deprived its life or not, and how this method does effect ordinary people and the society. I will also discuss what is the difference between criminals and the authority of a country that use capital punishment, as a legally punishing method, and what I thing would be a better alternative instead of this penalty. Capital punishment is the execution of a criminal who's sentence of death has been decided by a court. Capital Punishment was once a common penalty throughout the world. And it was inflected for a large number of crimes. However nowadays this kind of punishment has reduced more or less, as a result of people's struggle against old systems and old regimes. The World is now divided between countries that have abolished death penalty like Sweden, and those countries that have retained it, for instance Iraq, Iran, many deferent Muslim countries and USA, the later one has employed this method more than any other countries in the whole world. Before arguing for or against this penalty we have to take in consideration that every single person has the right to be treated faire in his/her life. It is every individual's basic human right, no matter what. Justice in a person's life could signify two factors, that is, no man has the right take life of another person's, and that a murder should or deserve to die. Those who have abolished death penalty have long time ago come to the conclusion, that this method is wrong and not effective in the long ran. For instance in the USA, the crimes are increasing more and more in spite of using capital punishment. Still there are a lot of countries that use this extremely cruel and grim way of punishing to preserve the justice in a society. In contrast I personally don't believe that capital punishment has that much power to deter people from committing crimes. The reason is that statistically there is no evidence that indicate this statement. In contrary those who have killed a person, it is said, that are rarely committing any crimes when released or paroled. Otherwise there is evidence that those who have committed other crimes such as burglary, drug crimes and those who abuse children sexually are committed the same crime over and over again, as son as they are realest. I'm of strong opinion that capital punishment gives the wrong impression to the ordinary, likewise it even could effect their life in domestic matters. I thing also that people's behaviour reflect a country's policy. Specifically if we take USA as an example, that have retained capital punishment, has the highest rate crimes involving a person's death. As I understand people in this country believe that they have the right to protect themselves by possessing guns. In this case they act like the government of their country. I believe that there must other effective penalty than capital punishment. Violence never solve any problem. In min opinion there is no differences between people or government of countries that are in favour of death penalty, and criminals who has committed homicide on a person who is not in self defend, because they actually do the same thing, they commit the same crime. Although the first one, that is the authority of a country, is doing it legally, for the sake of justice, in purpose of deterring people, and to create a better society of safety. This is what I think, that they think is the benefits of having capital punishment. I believe that countries, that have maintained capital punishment, argue also that this way of punishing has a unique power to scare people from committing crimes. I am of strong opinion that this is not the case. I think capital punishment is used because it is cheap and it might avoid vendetta and also because the criminals are sometime considered as dangerous to the society. Thus I consider this whole system completely wrong and unnecessary when I think better of it. There must be other methods that not contend to the right of human, namely imprisonment for long time or imprisonment for lifetime. It doesn't gain a country to get ride of criminals. In well organised prisons, prisoners would be economic assets. These prisoners should be required to do unpaid work within the prison, which is for the benefits of a country. I think the consequences of capital punishment are that people lose confidence for the authority of their country. Citizens might think that if it is legislative for the authority to deprive a person its life, then it might be OK for them too to take the law in their hand if they find it necessary in a particle situation. In this way they create a violent society instead of bringing order and discipline to their countries. I agree with those who argue that criminals should suffer for what they have done, and I think that they would suffer enough, by being deprived of their personal liberty, when they are given lifetime sentence. Finally I would like to emphasise that, to use force against a criminal doesn't preserve justice or create a better society. If capital punishment is used, the authority are criminals too. Furthermore violence doesn't solve any problems in the long run. Nobody should have the right to take life of another person, no matter for what purpose, and in any situation, because it stride against human right and it also insult human dignity.$$$﻿1. Introduction The population of Sweden, and the population of other developed nations, becomes fatter. Because of that people get more sick and besides it costs a lot of money in public service. To change peoples attitude when it comes to food and training, in order to stop the development, is almost impossible. In this momerand I will argue in favour of pretty dramatical changes which are, according to my opinion, necessary to solve the problem. The most important thing is to encourage children and teenagers to become more active and therefore physical training at school must be a high priority. Adults in the working life also need exercise and training to stay as healthy as possible, and I suggest compulsory training during working-hours. 2. Injuries 2.1 The physical and mental health of children and teenagers If you are in a good physical condition you feel better both physically and mentally. A fat person or a person who is not in a good shape will always bump into a lot of situations were he does not feel comfortable. If you are in good shape it is easier to concentrate in school which leads to better results. The most important thing is that you like yourself and whatever people say, there is no one who wants to be fat. A fat person often gets a bad self-confidence because of his weight. To have a good self-confidence and to live in harmony is very important whatever you are supposed to do. You will always perform better if you feel good about yourself because of the mental parts but also because of a better physical condition. A big problem is that if a person get in bad shape the mood to go training gets even lower and it becomes an evil spirit. When you are young it is most important to have a good self-confidence. At that time you are vulnerable and then you have the best opportunity to build a self-confidence for the rest of your life. You do not have to be fat! 2.2 Adult people When you grow up you will have lots of problems if your weight is to heavy. If you have been fat since you were young it will probably have characterised your life in a negative direction. Your body might be worn and the fact that you have lived as a fat person has probably lowed your self-confidence. With fatness comes problems with your legs especially your knees. Often it also leads to vascular disorder and problems with your heart. When it comes to work many people get problems with their back, they get tired and they don't have enough energy to do a good work. 3. Measures As I said in the introduction dramatic measures are necessary if we want to stop the negative development. In the first place I think we have to defend the physical training at school. When it comes to adults it is harder. You can't force an adult to train but I think that you can force the employer to facilitate training during working-hours. 3.1 More training at school The training at school is very important. That is why it is unluckily that training at school is being reduced. I think we should have three lectures of training every week. Unfortunately there are pupils who feel uncomfortable when it comes to physical training at school. Many pupils even feel agony when they know that it is time for the training lecture. Here the teachers have an important function. I do not think the biggest problem is that pupils do not want to train but the problem is that they feel ashamed for them-selves. You cannot require that everyone shall be athletes but those who exercise regular will feel better and therefor their dislike of training lectures will disappear. 3.2 More training at work any people have sedentary jobs or jobs which are monotonous and do not exercise in the spare time. The reason why many people do not exercise after work is because they have a lot of other things to take care of when they come home, things that they prior higher than their own health. The only solution to this problem has to be that the training can be done at work. Even among the adults should three times a week be suitable. I do not know exactly how this should be solved in practise, but some form of legislation is necessary. 4. Conclusion People are getting fatter, that is a fact. Fatness and overweight is bad for your health, that is also a fact. If we do not do anything or make changes that makes it even worse, for example reducing the physical training at school, it will become a large problem for the society. So, it is a fact that we got to do something. It cannot be hard to understand that exercise in school is extremely important. It should also be very good if people could train at their place of work. I know that you at some places of work have the right to train at working-hours but in those cases we are talking about maybe an hour a week. That is not enough!
EE167	1	﻿In this essay I am going to describe my knowledge in speaking, writing, reading and listening in English. I'm going to concentrate on my strengths and weaknesses in speaking and writing, with some comments on my reading and listening competence, between school and now. I've always liked English and since I started studying English in the 4th grade I've always found it a fascinating and challenging language. Even before that I terrorised my mother and father with lots of questions about different English words and phrases, and when we started studying English I tried to learn everything at once. I've had good teachers in English who have taught me very much, and they've helped me a lot. After upper secondary school, I went to France for one year and then to England one year; I wanted to practise my language skills. In England I lived and worked in London, at first I worked at hotel and then in a clothes shop. It was a very educating period, I learnt a lot of English and I got a chance to improve my oral English, which had never been good. When I went to school I mostly sat quiet and didn't do much to improve my skills in speaking. I found it easier to express myself by writing, because then I had time to think what I wanted to say, instead of letting the words slip out of my mouth and embarrass myself by saying the wrong words. And we actually never got any real chances to speak English in my school, it was always the teacher who spoke and held lectures. So we didn't really have any discussions, where we both talked and listened. After a while in London the words came naturally and I felt I could express myself quite easily, without twisting my brain too much. It was a tremendous joy when people gave me compliments for my English and some even asked if I was British or Irish! When it comes to my writing, I'm not happy about the development. As I said I've always found it easier to write than to speak. I used to feel more comfortable when I had it printed, and it gave me time to think of the spelling, the structure of the sentences, etc. I never had much trouble with the spelling, it has been clear to me how to spell easy and difficult words. But now it's not that obvious anymore. Well, I know how to spell, but sometimes I get uncertain of even the smallest and simplest word. I guess it's because I haven't written much in English since I went in school, and now I have to pay for it. To say something about my reading and listening, I don't think it has changed drastically from when I went to upper secondary school till now. I would read more, if I had more time. I like reading newspaper and novels, and I don't see it as an obstacle if it's in English, I rather see it as an opportunity for me to practise. I didn't like it when we had to listen to cassettes as a listening comprehension in school. I suppose that it was because I found it easier when I had the text or the questions on paper in front of me so that I could read them again if I had to and think a while before answering. I think I would like it more now, maybe because I've become more confident in myself concerning English. To conclude this essay, I will sum up the biggest changes I've noticed about my English; I feel more confident in speaking now, I speak fluently and find it easy to communicate. My writing (and spelling) is unfortunately not as good as it has been but that's something I will work with. When it comes to reading and writing I don't think that it has changed so much. On the whole I feel confident in my English and I hope I will develop my knowledge even more during this course and be able to go deeper into the study of the English language.$$$﻿ People's fear of the unknown As I see it, the main theme of The Fifth Child is that we people are afraid of matters that we are not familiar with, things we do not understand, it is about people's fear of the unknown and their different ways of dealing with it. What we are not familiar with, we do not like and sometimes the unknown scares us. In this book, Ben is the cause of people's fear. The setting is a small town outside London, England, and the period of time is between the 1960s and the 80s, a period of changes; there were attitude changes and more and more criminality. In England as in many other European countries, it is not common to have many children, as it is in other parts of the world, and people like Ben are certainly not common. In other parts of the world Harriet and David might be considered to be just like everyone else, not being looked upon as oddballs (even for their wish for many children) as they are in their current society. That is why the setting is important for the main theme of the book. Harriet and David want to have a lot of children, at least six of them, but none of their friends or relatives understand why, it is not common to have a lot of children in their part of the world, and what is not common scares people. Dorothy, Harriet's mother, fears that it would be too difficult for David and Harriet to bring up that many children and she says that they sometimes scare her. (p 22) She does not understand why they have to rush the pregnancies as if the chance to have children would disappear if they do not have all the children at once. Although David and Harriet are careful, Harriet gets pregnant straight after the birth of their fourth child. Their fifht child, Ben, is born. Ben is not like the family's other children; he grows very fast physically, but develops slowly mentally. No one likes Ben, not even his parents and he shows ho feelings at all. Naturally Harriet and the rest think there is something wrong with Ben, and they are afraid of him because they do not understand him. Ben represents the abnormal in the book and by his parents and relatives fear of him we are shown how people might react when they confront something they are not familiar with. Ben is what we all would be if we did not have any emotions or remorseful feelings. But Ben cannot be changed or manipulated, he is who he is. He is also symbolic or every person's ability and way of being evil. "Happiness. A happy family. The Lovatts were a happy family. It was what they had chosen and what they had deserved." (p 28) This sentence seems to have two references; one to their life before the birth of Ben and the other to when he is born. It means that you get what you deserve. Before Ben was born, they were a happy family and they deserved to be. But then Harriet and David obviously challenge the "normal" family's destiny by having more children than the ordinary family, and maybe that's why they deserve to have a monster child like Ben. That is another theme of the book; people's wish for more, they are not contented with what they have. Harriet and David should perhaps have been satisfied with their four children. Another problem raised in the book is the different opportunities for children who comes from wealthy versus poor families. Molly, David's mother, wants David to understand how spoiled he and his family are when he says that everyone should have a room. Molly says "Everyone in the world! Everybody!" and we can tell she is being sarchastic about David's ungratefulness when we read that "She had intended to sound humorous". (p 31) She wants David to realize how lucky he is to be well and happy. She thinks of poor children which do not have the same economic prerequisite as children like David's. The setting is important for the theme, it would have been a different story if it had taken place somewhere else in the world. Something that is normal and well in one part of the world, might be considered as strange and scarying in another. What people do not understand or are not familiar with scares them. Ben is different from the other characters in the book, and he is the cause of the destruction of the family's happiness.
EE161	1	﻿ Things could be worse than hearing children curse In Shirley Peckham's article she wants to clean up the language after having heard too many swear words from teenagers passing by her husband's shop. According to Peckham, the children ought to be "boxed around the ears". In this essay I will argue against the need of cleaning up teenagers' language, which Peckham argues for. Firstly, I will argue against Peckhams' problem with cursing children. Secondly, I will argue why cursing is a part of adolescence. Thirdly, I will argue how trying to change teenagers' ways of communicate will not do any good. Lastly I will sum up my paragraphs. The issue "cleaning up the language" that Shirley Peckham introduces in her article and the problems it concerns I do not find very worrying. Peckham describes having heard several terrible swear words from children passing by her husbands' shop and a group of boys at a railway station. This observation might be considered interesting for some, but far from sensational for most. Just a few teenagers, who happened to curse while passing by Mrs Peckham, are not very representative for every teenager of Britain. Generalising will not give a fair overview of the situation. Peckham has obviously exaggerated the situation and created a problem, which does not exist. Concerning the language of those teenagers Peckham has observed I consider it being a part of adolescence. Peckham has apparently forgotten everything of being rebellious during the years of adolescence. As I see it swear words are a part of adolescence, at least for some who are fighting through this period of life where many physical and mental changes occur. By using curse words teenagers express their attitudes towards school, grown-ups and society as a whole. Children at this age are tired of parents' and teachers' demands. They want to be rebellious and dissociate themselves from stiff, boring adults. Cursing is one way of doing this. I agree with Peckham to some extent. It would be preferable if teenagers use other words to express themselves instead of using swear words. However, teenagers' swearing is just a rebellious action, something they will get tired of and consider foolish and childish when they get older and more mature. As grown-ups they have more than likely changed and will only curse if getting upset. There might be some exceptions, but there always are. Therefore I believe that children using swear words is nothing to worry about. I do not see the need of searching for solutions of changing teenagers' ways of expressing themselves. Trying to change teenagers' ways of communicate will not do any good. They are rebellions and are not willing to give up any rights of being rebellious. If for instance parents and teachers tell their children and pupils to watch their mouth and stop cursing it might lead to an opposite effect. As tired as teenagers already are of demands and complaints from adults they would probably curse more than ever. Peckham's method of changing children's language by boxing them around the ears, is definitely not an option when trying to change teenager's ways of communicate. I call this corporal punishment, which perhaps is legal in England, but is far from accepted. Peckham should be ashamed of such suggestions. Shirley Peckham has observed some cursing teenagers and has drawn the conclusion that she has encountered a problem that needs to be solved. However, there is no problem. Peckham is just being confused of teenagers' ways of communicate. She is obviously not aware of how teenagers behave when going through adolescence. Cursing is a way for teenagers to dissociate themselves from grown-ups and their demands. This stage of childish action where teenagers want to be rebellions, which seems like a problem for Peckham, is something they are going to grow out when becoming adults. Therefore Shirley Peckham should not worry of matters she has no knowledge of.$$$﻿ Swedish education in danger In Sweden the Teachers' Educational Committee (LUK) has proposed a reform of the Swedish teacher's education programs and the Swedish parliament is soon to decide the future of Swedish school. The reform contains quiet drastic changes and has been intensively debated in Swedish media. One of the bigger changes is that less time will be spent on subject studies, an reduction from 120 academic points to only 40 possibly 60 academic points. In Dagens Nyheter Arne Hellden, lecturer at Linkeping University, gives the reader the main features of the reform and strongly argues against it. Unfortunately the picture of what LUK's reform consist of does not get very clear when Hellden is trying to explain the reform's main features. However I will as well as Hellden, and in support of his article, argue against LUK's proposal by explaining the absurdity of the reform and by arguing for the importance of having the present amount of subject studies. LUK's reform seems just like a desperate attempt to reduce the increasing number of failing students. Many alternations have been made in Swedish education during the last few years. The change that probably has been most controversial and most troublesome is the alternation of the Swedish grade system at the senior level of the nine-year compulsory school and at upper secondary school. Earlier pupils could receive grades from one through five, where five was the highest and one the lowest. In 1994 the grade scale was changed to grades failed, passed, passed with distinction, and passed with much distinction. Before the change the requirements for qualifying for upper secondary school was based only on the average grade, but then when the grading system changed it was also required to pass the subjects; Swedish, Mathematics, and English. The consequence was that many pupils failed one of the required subjects and could not move on to upper secondary. The situation has unfortunately grown worse and politicians are desperately looking for solutions. If believing great changes in education will solve the problem of failing pupils, this reform of teachers' education proposed by LUK could definitely be a solution to the problem. However, I do not believe that reducing subject studies will solve any problem, only create more. Those responsible for the reform do obviously not realise the importance of subject knowledge. According to Hellden the expert pedagogues that have influenced LUK are more interested in educating student teachers how knowledge is formed and organised rather than letting them acquire knowledge. This is presumably an attempt to add more pedagogic to teachers' education programs, which certainly is of great importance. However, I believe that the present teachers' education programs include enough of pedagogic. There is definitely no need for such a pedagogic form earlier mentioned, which seems more like mumbo jumbo than a serious suggestion. In school children learn basic knowledge for future studies at college and University. This basic knowledge is based on simple facts and uncomplicated structure, and does not require knowledge of how knowledge is formed and organised when teaching it. What is considerable, however, is that teachers know their subjects. If reducing subject studies to less than half of what the present teacher's education programs have, teachers might lose their authority as being an academically learned teacher. Pupils or their parents may question teachers' ability to teach if they do not have enough subject knowledge. Having authority is an essential part of being a teacher. Teachers must feel their pupils respect them and that they can share their knowledge and play an important role in their pupils' learning. Teachers of today has a base of subject knowledge, they know their subjects and feel secure about teaching. However, the future teacher role seems very worrying if LUK's reform is approved in the Swedish parliament. Teacher will not longer be teaching their pupils, but guiding them through the world of knowledge as experts in how knowledge is formed and organised. Some politicians might believe LUK's reform of teachers' education programs will solve the problem of failing pupils and other problems they earlier caused. However, hopefully most politicians will realise the absurdity of this suggestion.
EE460	0	﻿An essay about my English...hmm. The thing is, I can't make out whether I can or cannot make myself understandable in a, what you can call, a satisfactory way. The purpose of this essay was to write about both the strengths and weaknesses in my use of English. The four components that had to be written about were: listening, reading, speaking and writing. I'll start with listening, and if we are lucky, of which I have hopes, end with the last one on the list and that should be writing, shouldn't it? I'm quite satisfied with my listening capability. I have no problems to follow people when they talk "normally". (When I say normally I mean when people don't mumble or talk very quite. But that's another story...) I can have difficulty understanding if someone talks with a very strong accent, use (for me) unusual words or talk very fast. Sometimes I find it hard to follow teenager conversations, because they often talk fast and use slang, words which I never might have heard of. Reading. I try very hard to keep up with the reading habits I used to have. I've spent some time in England and bought quite an amount of books. But as time passes by I have become lazier and that has affected my habit of reading English literature. I don't have trouble in reading English prose, not at all, I'm just lazy... When this term started I was a bit worried about all the English literature. But now after I have had a good look at the books I don't feel at all worried. It feels more like a challenge and it's going to be fun to work with the ones they have chosen. To get further down the list, I'll start writing about my speaking skill. I would evidently rather talk about my speaking capability than write about it. But that's not what this course is about, is it? (Maybe I should save my chit-chat for some other time...) I consider myself as a very talkative person. I find it very hard to keep my mouth shut sometimes. In junior high I often got "hushed" so that the rest of the class could join the teachers conversation... After a while I stopped talking in class but talked even more outside the classroom. I speak English with a British accent, that is due to (as I wrote earlier) my stay in England. Some people find my accent quite sweet some do not. Nevertheless. I feel that when it comes to speaking English I am not daft. I've got many English friends and they don't often correct me when I talk. (Well, I can't say if that's good or bad...) Over the years I've worked longer periods with English talking people and one of them once asked me where in England I came from. That's one of the best compliments I have ever got actually. That was a few years ago but I still remember it like it was yesterday! To finish this essay I should write something about my writing. There is just one way for me to put this; I am a very bad writer. This is not only a problem for me in English, I find it hard to write in any language, including Swedish. (I was very pleased to find a writing course in the curriculum.) I feel that I'm going to spend a lot of time behind my dear word processor... With some guiding from You I hope that I will master even this problem, although it feels like I have an iceberg to climb over. That's what I have to say about my English in these four subjects. I think both you and I can agree upon that my writing only can get better! But we here to learn aren't we?$$$﻿ Speciesism -The racism against animals This essay will show you why we ought to treat animals not as means to our own ends but as ends in them selves. I will start by giving you an explanation to why our attitudes towards animals are the way they are. After this I will reject two of the most common arguments of why we need and have the right to use animals as means. Finally I will give a superior argument which will force you to accept the fact that we have no right exploiting animals just to satisfy our own pleasures. I will plea for reason and logic, but this will not be sufficient if you are not ready to change your own attitudes. A person's attitudes have a tendency to overrun logic and reason, so please have an open mind, and think of what I just said. With this in mind, consider women's position in history. In the late 1800's women were men's possession and no one questioned this. In fact, Thomas Aquino said that 'a female is a defect male', and he was one of the greatest thinkers in the history of mankind. Those were the facts, the truth those days, just as it is a fact nowadays that animals do not have any rights to claim towards humans. The same parallel could be drawn between the black slaves and the animal's situation today. What I want to say is that after every liberation movement people talk about it as 'the last remaining form of discrimination'. You should be very wary of talking about 'the last remaining form of discrimination' because, as I have shown, there are always some group of living creatures still being discriminated. Yesterday it was sexism and racism, today it is speciesism. What we today consider morally justified may tomorrow be regarded as a great injustice. I assume you can not argue against this historical fact, and hence you have to admit that our attitudes today just might be immoral. The strength in my argumentation so far could, to some extent, be questioned if humans needed animals to survive, which is one of the most frequent arguments coming from speciesists. I agree there would be no immoral in killing animals and eating them in order to survive, but in many parts of the world this is not necessary, including our own. We can very well get all the nutritious substances we need from vegetables, different substitutes and additional vitamins. This argument is therefore rejected on basis of its incorrectness. Could the speciesist defend his position in another way than the statement that humans need animals to survive? Let us consider the second of the most frequent arguments given in favour of speciesism. It claims we have the right to use animals as means to our own ends, when it is, at the same time, claiming we do not have the right to discriminate women and black people. It goes something like this: 'Women and blacks are members of our own species, animals are not, hence we have the right to exploit animals'. If the first argument failed on basis of incorrectness this argument fails on the basis of both relevance and logic. If we discriminate animals just because they are animals, we might as well discriminate women because they are women, and black people just because they are black. This is called sexism and racism. We can not discriminate any living creature on the basis of characteristics such as sex, skin colour, intelligence or species affiliation. The question we need to find an answer to is: What is the one capability humans and non-humans share? This question is answered by the Supreme argument, crushing any possible argument defending speciesism. Any living creature possessing the capability of having feelings of pleasure and pain, has the right of not being used as means but always as ends'. This is the Supreme argument. On the basis of this, it should be quite obvious why speciesism is wrong, why we do not have the right to use animals as food-machines or experimenting on them. Even if the two arguments in favour of speciesism somehow could be defended, this argument could not be rejected. It is as simple as that. We now have a complete logical reasoning rejecting the speciesism in our society. The only obstacle now is your own attitudes. It may take some time to change them, and that is all right. The important thing is that you hopefully have started to reflect on your moral values, and eventually you will no longer find yourself on the side of the oppressors.
EE352	1	﻿ Enrich life - become a teacher Since the beginning of time one of human beings most important tasks has been to propa-gate their species and bring the descendants up to strong and intelligent young people. In my opinion the latter is still one of our main purposes of life and therefore I find it strange that only a few people think that their mission of life is to bring children up professionally as teachers. Even more strange is that so many are reluctant to work with education. I am of opposit opinion and have always known I wanted to teach. Notwithstanding that firm conviction I often find myself arguing for teaching, and defending my choice of a profes-sion to people around me. This is what I will do in this essay as well. These peoples first argument always tend to deal with money. They find it incredible that anyone with a common sense would study four years at a University for a salary of 15 000 Swedish crowns and with small chances of a great increase of wages. This argu-ment both puzzles and alarms me. It puzzles me because everyone ought to be aware of the present debate on teachers' wages which sooner or later must lead to the better. It alarms me because I think it is awkward that acquaintances of mine are that materialistic and think money is of such importance that they would rather have a boring well-paid job than an interesting less well-paid one, given that they can not have both. Naturally, eco-nomy is an important aspect of life but such is work, since you generally spend about half of your awake hours working. That sums up to quite some hours in a lifetime and therefore I prefer a vocation I really enjoy. Next counterargument is often that the school has an extremely hectical atmosphere, with pupils behaving like hooligans, which can give anyone a nervous breakdown in a few weeks. Admittedly such a scene is not impossible but I am inclined to believe that such a situation depends mainly on the teacher. If the teacher loves children, enjoy being with them and is experienced as well as prepared of some children being awfully mischie-vous it should not occur. Personally, I think dealing with all these different unpredictable young individuals is exciting and a charming part of the profession. Likewise, getting through the barricades and reaching the real restive and disorderly ones is a satisfactory kick without equivalence. Even though not always feeling satisfied with classroom performance, a teacher always feel needed which is a most important sense. While others are tearing their hair because of inability to change what is wrong in society, a teacher can actually do something about the so-called decadence of human morals and society. The mere becoming a teacher actu-ally means doing something valuable for the society because of the scarcity of teachers. Until the year of 2000, 62 000 new full-time teachers must be employed in Sweden. 10 000 of these will not be educated. That is to say, there will not be a problem finding a job because of the many vacancies and the fact that there is a school - which implies a potential place of work for a teacher - in every inhabited region. Being attractive on the labour-market, is a reason as good as any to become a teacher, but from my point of view the nonmonotonous and flexible method of working is of greater importance. I am aware of that being a teacher includes working long hours in a stressful and loud environment, but I am convinced that it will never get tedious and dull. As a teacher every single day is a new challange, one never know what will happen during the day and always need a plan B and C up one's sleeve. In conclusion I find numerous reasons for becomimg a teacher, but some people consider them only three: June, July and August. Undoubtly those are tempting, but the main reason for anyone to become a teacher ought to be the possibility to work with children, follow their development and bring them up to strong and intelligent account-able citizens. Teaching is hard work and will not turn anyone economically rich over-night, but I am sure it is a very enriching vocation when it comes to quality of life. For-tunately, one can always educate to be a teacher and then marry rich.$$$﻿ TV - a reliable educator? In an ordinary Swedish home, the importance of television is constantly growing. TV is often used as a baby-sitter and Swedish children are generally watching more than two hours of television a day without any possibility to question what they see, due to lack of parental presence. I think it is alarming that children are being exposed to impressions from TV on their own, and I will discuss the situation in this essay. y eyes were opened to this problem the other day, when reading an article saying that, at the age of 18, the average child has spent more time watching TV than engaging in any other activity except sleep. Consequently, the average child of today, experience a lot more through various soaps and films on TV than they do in real life. A child's personality is developing in every minute in ensemble with the environment he or she lives in and the experiences he or she does. So, if TV answers for a majority of these impressions, one must revalue and look upon TV as an educator of the same importance as parents and teachers. I am not convinced that all parents and all teachers are reliable on giving children a true picture of the world, but I am convinced that they give a more realistic world picture than TV does. Most youths are able to distinguish between fiction and fact, but young children have certain difficulties deciding what is real and what is not on TV. Admittedly, the mere thought of a whole generation growing up with a distorted world view, frightens me and gives me a feeling of powerlessness because no one seems to know how to prevent that taking place. Obviously, there are suggestions for solutions. Thus, in various ways prohibit TV-watching and make an effort to engage children in other activities. An interesting suggestion is, the V chip, mentioned in Ginia Bellafante's article Locking out violence. The V chip is a computer chip installed in TV sets to make it impossible to watch programs that embrace a certain level of violence. This V chip would, probably, lock out the most violent sequences and decrease some children's time spent in front of the television. On the other hand, the V chip might lull parents into false security, resulting in children watching even more television. Undoubtedly, children do watch, and will keep on watching a lot of television in one way or another, and therefore one must act according to these conditions. Thus, parents should keep their children company in front of the TV, to be able to discuss violence, ideals or whatever might turn up. Second best, is to discuss these matters after the TV-program. Similarly, questions aroused from TV should be discussed in school, since TV plays an important role in children's every day life. What is more, emotional topics, such as relations, abuse or morals can sometimes easier be brought up in class if based on fiction instead of someone's own thoughts or experiences. That is to say, soaps and films might actually be useful in education, as long as followed up in adult presence. Moreover, there are actually people working as film-educationists, teaching how to use TV-programs and films in a didactic manner. I have read an interview on a film-educationist who asserts that it is a democratic right to get the possibility to learn the language of TV. He lectures on the influences TV has on the average child and on the tricks that film producers use to achieve the greatest possible effects, with feigned fights as well as artificial beauty - most of them attained with a computor. He tells the children that Arnold Schwarzenegger is always surrounded by midget actors and filmed from a worm's-eye view to give the impression that he is huge. The film-educationist continues with indicating that Julia Roberts' nude body in Pretty Woman is actually not her's but a transexual model's, since the producers thought Julia did not satisfactory fulfil the ideals of beauty. Eventually, children - with help from adults - will realize that the major part of what they see in soaps and films is nothing but illusions. Hopefully this fact will make children watch TV with scepticism and so, add less TV-inspired values and ideals to their own world views.
EE047	0	﻿This essay focuses on my ability in speaking, writing, reading and listening to English; what my strenghts and weaknesses are, and how I feel about my competence. First, I'd like to discuss my strengths and weaknesses: The area in which I feel I could better myself the most is attitude. My gravest mistakes in writing or speaking comes from when I think that I already know something, and consequently don't have to study it. I am blessed with a good head for studying, but that fact has also lead me to neglect doing the studying that I should have done, because "I already know that". This trait is at its peak when it comes to identifying paragraphs from grammar books, or citing rules for applying certain linguistic features. I tend to use my feeling for language in those situations, and, even though it works in most cases, it's not without its hitches. This behaviour probably comes from a combination of laziness and haste, but sometimes it's hard to motivate myself to spend hours trying to learn something that I feel that I already know the principles of. I want to move on, and get to the good stuff. Another of my weak points is not a credit to my listening and reading skills. I tend to think that I know more than I actually know. I have misinterpreted words for years and then, by chance, I have looked something up near one of them in the dictionary and discovered that a word I thought I knew, meant something entirely different, or at least not quite what I thought it meant On the other hand, when I'm using my English, I get very conscientious. I watch my language, and try hard to get it right. That's my orderly side, and it causes me from time to time to get frustrated when I make simple mistakes, such as pronounce words I'm familiar with wrong. I take pride in knowing the right prepositions when I speak and write, and understanding verbal humour, for example. However, this is not a feature without it's downside, as I may make a pretentious or quaint impression, in my effort to use as much of my vocabulary as possible. I have read English books, both fiction and non-fiction, for a long time, because I've found myself interested in things that was written in English, and that training has made me a quick reader - I read English almost unimpededly, but it has also improved my writing skills - I write in English with nearly the same speed as I write in Swedish. My interests has influenced my speaking too, as I frequently watch English-speaking movies or television shows, and have modeled some of my speaking patterns after fictional characters. I believe it has been for the better, as I have chosen characters with eloquence and great speaking voices. I regret that I'm not more often in positions where I would have to use English, as I think that I'm a bit rusty. I have always been proud of my pronounciation, with an inclination for going in the British direction. That is also the case in spelling. Something that I think is weak in my background is the ability to listen to different dialects, and still "get" everything. It's not only then, but mainly with dialect-speaking individuals. I find it hard not to ask every once in a while what the other person just said when in contact with native English speakers, and that's a nuisance for both of us. The overall impression, to conclude this essay, of my English competence is that I could use some training in the oral part - I feel somewhat unsure now and then of how I sound. Also, I think that my writing as a whole is adequate, if not entirely satisfactory: I would like some exercises in composition, but I feel that my fluency is all right. I think that maybe I feel more competent about my English than I actually has reason to be. On the other hand, if I think that I'm that good, then perhaps I'm not so bad.$$$﻿ Why the paragraph that regulates the right to claim for damages ought to be revised In theory, in Sweden, even a burglar is able to claim for damages if getting injured on private property. This is morally and ethically wrong and something needs to be done to make it impossible. If a burglar, for instance falls and breaks a leg due to the owner of the house having omitted to sand his/her icy driveway and doorstep during a cold winter, the housebreaker can thus claim for damages from the person(s) responsible for keeping the driveway safe, the very person(s) the burglar attempted to steal from. Maybe a thief is about to break into a house through the roof hatch and one of the steps on the ladder snaps causing him to fall to the ground and get hurt. Say that someone is trying to break in through a window but the hinges are so rusty that the window falls out and cuts the thief badly, making him bleed so heavily that an ambulance is needed, should the owner then have to pay the thief damages for his sufferings? It 's not very likely that a person who has entered someone elses premises with committing a crime in mind, would risk giving him- /herself away by turning to the legal system in order to claim his/her so called rights. Nevertheless it's still appalling that it is in fact possible. My opinion is that it shouldn't even be feasible in theory for someone with criminal intentions to make capital out of the property owners unability or neglect to keep the house and yard/garden up to a certain standard. Even if it is desirable that the grounds are safe to anyone who might enter it, an individual should have the right to decide over his/her own property. The case might also be that the weather has been variable with snow and minus degrees, then thaw with a following cold snap turning the driveway into an ice-rink over night. This can make it difficult to keep up with the sanding for instance. The owner might not even deem it necessary since he/she is aware of the problem and therefore take precautions. One might also think that if you enter someones private property, you do it at your own risk, especially if you are uninvited. Some might argue that the uninvited person falling on the icy driveway may be the childminder bringing your sick child home, or that the person falling from your roof is the chimney - sweeper. Shouldn't these honest people have the right to expect being able to perform their duties in a safe environment? Shouldn't they have the right to claim for damages if they are injured on your property? Yes they should! This means that the discussed right must remain included in the law but the fact that it's possible for a criminal to benefit from it and recieve money for getting injured in the above described situations, indicates that the paragraph needs to be revised. Although it might be considered difficult to write a legal paragraph that excludes persons with shady intentions, without violating the rights of the general public. Another problem is to be able to prove that this person who got injured on your doorstep was in fact there for suspicious reasons. One can only hope that this right doesn't apply to people on the way out from your house, carrying off your new stereo in their arms while slipping. Can you then call a person who hasn't yet committed a crime a thief or a burglar? Yes I believe you can if he/she went there with the intentions of stealing, if he/she brought tools to use for breaking and entering, if he/she happends to get injured before accomplishing the theft is beside the point, he/she is still a criminal and should thus not benefit from the right to claim for damages. One might even go so far as to say that it serves the burglar right to break a leg for trying to break the law. Maybe an icy driveway could be considered an excellent safeguard to prevent someone from walking of with your valuables.
EE046	1	﻿ TELEVISION, OUR BEST FRIEND AND OUR WORST ENEMY Television has a central and important part in our lives. Television provides us with company if we are lonely, something to talk about, a babysitter, entertainment, excitement and happiness when Sweden scores the winning goal, good and bad news, an escape fromreality, a visual journey around the world and lots of other things. Television can give uswhatever we want and since it can supply us with these things in sound, text and vision television is the ultimate form of media. Most of us watch TV everyday. Some more and some less than others. We can relax infront of the TV after a long day or we can associate with our family or friends in front of the TV cheering for the Swedish football-team. We can watch a documentary on the life of the African elephant or the political situation in China and learn something about the world outside our living-room. Television can also provide us with traditions. Christmas wouldn't be the same without Baloo the Bear singing and dancing through the jungle or Ferdinand, the pacifist bull, humiliating the proud and macho matador. Television can be a quitegood thing if we use it wisely and don't let it take over our lives. Television can also cause trouble. Trouble that can be serious or a little less serious but still trouble. I remember what it could be like in my family when we were going to watch TV together. This was in the early eighties and we were five family-members and we only had two channels and no remote-control and we argued quite a lot about what channel to watch or who would get to change the channel or the sound. I realise that the situation has changed since then but I do think that we still argue about what to watch. We can become fat and/or lazy by watching too much TV and not exercising enough. Then we get miserable and depressed when we compare ourselves with the slim and beautiful soap-opera stars. Our ability to separate reality from fiction is also at risk of deteriorating. The choreographed and designed violence doesn't seem to hurt that much despite all the bloodshed. I think that it is better to stimulate our imagination by for example reading a book and creating the pictures in the head. It is better to create our own individual fantasies and dreams instead of letting a tv-producer do it for us. When we sit there in our sofa staring at the TV we are an easy target for political messages, propaganda, shady beauty-ideals, commercials and other things that can affect our lives. But it is up to us to choose what to watch and to be selective and listen with critical ears. We can't just sit there and absorb the information and then blame television for all problems in society and for messing with our and our children's heads. We have all an individual responsibility for our own minds. TV-watching can quite easily become a habit. But that habit is easy to break. When I moved to Uppsala in August I didn't bring my TV. I missed it in the beginning, of course, but now two months later I don't miss it at all, not even "the X-files".$$$﻿ THE SWEDISH MONARCHY A NICE TRADITION WORTH KEEPING? In dictionaries the word democracy is defined as "a system of government in which everyone in the country can vote to elect its members" and as "a situation in which everyone is equal and has the right to vote, make decisions etc". The word monarchy is defined as "a system in which a country is ruled by a king or a queen". Sweden is paradoxically both a democracy and a monarchy and the way I see it a country cannot or at least should not be both. Some of the main arguments I have heard from people who wants to keep the monarchy are that "Sweden has always been a monarchy" and " it's such a nice tradition". Yes, Sweden is one of the oldest monarchies in Europe and we have a history full of fascinating stories about royal war-heroes, conspiracies and mysteriously murdered kings. But those arguments aren't relevant to the issue. Today's system and society can't be compared with for example the eighteenth century and our present king Carl XVI Gustav can't be compared with Carl XII. The word is constantly changing and today monarchy is an old-fashioned system which doesn't fit into a democratic society such as ours. To use history and tradition as arguments in this serious matter is just a naive and ignorant way of trying to avoid discussion and debate. We have to eliminate the romantic and sentimental image that surrounds the royal family and the monarchy as a system. We have to look at our society from a logical and practical point of view. I mentioned the word democracy and it's meaning earlier. People around the world are fighting for it. People sacrifice their lives for the right to vote and choose their leaders, the right to speak their mind and the right to be treated as equals. Democracy is not as obvious to everybody as it is for us. In a monarchy the regent is not elected. The Swedish monarch is not chosen by the people and he/she does not have the same rights as everybody else. He/she does not have the right to vote, he/she is not free to choose his/her religion and despite the fact that he/she is the head of our state he/she has got no political power. But still he/she ranks above everybody else and he/she requires to be addressed as "his/her royal highness" or "your majesty". And all that because he/she was born a crown-prince/princess and through inheritance became head of a state. Sweden is a democracy. The Swedish people want to be treated as equals and with respect. Men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, natives and immigrants etc. Then why do more than 70% of the Swedish population accept this kind of class-difference and segregation where a small, limited group of people are treated as if they were more important and worth more respect than the rest of the people just because they were born by royal parents? Is it because "it's such a nice tradition"? Another argument that I have come across is the royal family's popularity. People seem to love reading and talking about their romances and other private matters. The media's coverage of the royal family has increased and the interest among the population has also increased because of that.. That argument would become very weak if today's media-situation would change and that is exactly what the royal family wants. They are beginning to complain about the lack of privacy and the media's interference of their lives and that is understandable. But their popularity depends completely on the media. So, is their popularity totally based on the fact that they are a never-creasing source of gossip and would they be as popular if the monarch had the power? History, tradition and popularity are all quite weak arguments pro-monarchy. But they are also very difficult to ignore. These things are deeply rooted in the Swedish people. We have become used to the monarchy and a habit is always difficult to break. But the society of today is in need of a change. Today's monarchy is an old fashioned and reactionary system where the monarch's only function seems to be waving at people from a balcony, cutting ribbons and throwing champagne-bottles at boats. Do we really need that?
EE045	1	﻿ Restrained by absurd rules? "TV4 is restrained by absurd rules" was the headline of an article printed in the debate section of UNT on 12 October. Its author, Jan Nordling, managing director of TV4 Uppland, argues that it is about time that television politics of Sweden were radically changed. When, at the turn of the year 01/02, a new agreement will be settled between TV4 and the state he wants to see less retarding requirements on commercial television. In his opinion, the main goal with the new settlement must be to assure a definite rise in profitability for TV4. Personally, however, I want to assert that it is highly impreferable, in a wider perspective, to promote a development where market forces get to dominate the basis of all decisions. Jan Nordling wants the present rules that regulate commercials within TV4 to be adjusted so that they are much more similar to the ones that regulate Swedish satellite channels. He claims that it is utopian to avoid commercial breaks in a commercial television channel and suggests shorter, but in turn more frequent, interruptions. According to Jan Nordling, this would be more attractive to the people who are watching, but I am not convinced. The main reason why he wants to see this change is undoubtedly the fact that it would be more attractive to advertisers and hence boost TV4's economy. The managing director of TV4 Uppland is also of the opinion that TV4 should be allowed to follow international custom in its advertising. He claims, for example, that the Swedish prohibition of commercials aimed at children is completely unfounded. "Children are not that gullible and have not got the economic force necessary for such prohibitions to be motivated". If the goal is not to manipulate these children, then what is it? Children are just as easily influenced as everyone else is. The difference, that motivates the present rule in Sweden, is that they cannot be expected to have the same knowledge about potential effects of commercials as grown-ups have. Small children can sometimes not even distinguish commercials from normal programs and hence cannot, in the same way as adults very often do, actively choose not to be manipulated by simply stop watching. When it comes to the economic force then it is quite evident that it is their parents' force that has to be considered here, not their own one. Jan Nordling thinks, furthermore, that the Swedish ban on advertisements for pure opinions or viewpoints is a much awkward exception to the more general rule we have in Sweden about freedom of speech. He takes the discussion one step further by also questioning why political and religious commercials should be banned. These reflections are interesting and quite understandable in a way, but since the effects of commercials have been proved, more than once, these prohibitions are justified. If they were not there we would very likely face a situation where we were almost daily exposed to pure propaganda. Jan Nordling recognizes, certainly, that ethical considerations in many cases are motivated, but is of the opinion that it from case to case should be up to every company itself to make the judgements and decisions necessary. Personally, I think that it is better to be safe than sorry in this sort of situation. I would like to assert that no matter how strict the present rules may be it is better to keep them than to run the risk of facing a disastrous development. The only reason why Jan Nordling wants it to be up to every company itself to make the ethical judgements is that he realizes that it would be a way for TV4 to bring in more money. Why, I am quite convinced that they would choose to be much less strict than today. According to Jan Nordling, the main reason why it is important to assure a definite rise in TV4's profitability is that domestic production of television programs must be ensured. "To assert Swedish culture in the world of television is important, but perhaps even more important is that television in more ways than today depicts a Swedish multi-cultural reality". This sounds all very nice, but exactly what Swedish culture is it that TV4 will depict through its broadcasting of an even greater number of soap operas and other forms of light entertainment? Are these types of program really essential for us in the way that he wants us to believe? Furthermore, in what way would they depict a multi-cultural reality? Would minorities in Sweden be better represented if TV4's main goal is to ensure as high a profitability as possible? The managing director of TV4 Uppland is also of the opinion that the company's concession fee should be done away with. He finds it absurd that TV4 in this way pays for some of the programs broadcasted by SVT, which very clearly reveals his double standard of morality. He has just paid a warm tribute to the types of program that SVT actually produce by, among other things, saying that it is essential to depict a multi-cultural reality. How can it then be absurd to support the activities of SVT? To me, such an utterance makes his previous statements ring even more hollow. To summarize, the main goal with the coming settlement between TV4 and the state must, in Jan Nordling's opinion, be to ensure a definite rise in profitability. By simply analyzing his main ideas, presented above, we can see clearly for ourselves that it all boils down to money. I think that we should be proud, rather than anything else, of the present rules that regulate the activities within TV4. They are there to protect individuals and to consider them being absurd is, to me, quite absurd in itself. Summary Jan Nordling, managing director of TV4 Uppland, asserts in the article "TV4 is restrained by absurd rules" (UNT Oct. 12, 1999) that it is about time that television politics of Sweden were radically changed. In his opinion, the main goal with the new agreement, that in the near future is to be settled between TV4 and the state, must be to assure a definite rise in TV4's profitability. In order to boost their economy he believes that it is essential to change the rules that regulate advertising within the channel. He also finds it necessary to abolish the concession fee that TV4 presently is obliged to pay to the state.$$$﻿ Would a Spelling Reform of the English Language be an Improvement? It is only in recent years that linguists have grasped what considerable differences there are between our two channels of language. To a large extent their improved knowledge has been promoted by the tape-recorder (Milroy & Milroy, 1985). To give some examples of differences that may cause confusion we still, as is well known, preserve letters in our spelling that represent sounds which long ago ceased to be pronounced, such as -p in the word receipt. Distinctions are commonly made in spelling where there is no longer a distinction in pronounciation. The pairs sea/see and meat/meet are only two out of many of the same kind. On the opposite side we have got distinctions that have emerged in speech without any trace of it to be seen in writing. Think for example of the spelling -ng in singer and finger. It is the exact same. When it comes to diphthongs we can often see them represented by a single letter, such as -i in mice. Conversely, modern phonemes that are definitely pure vowels can sometimes be represented by so called digraphs. An example of a digraph would be the -au of author (Barber, 1993). As we have seen then there is a great number of inconsistencies to be found in the English spelling system and one result of those inconsistencies is the prevalence of so called spelling-pronounciations. These arise when a word is given a new pronounciation through the influence of its spelling (ibid). One example of this is the rather common re-introduction of -t in often. According to Barber (1993:202) spelling-pronounciations are particularly likely to appear when "universal education and the wide dissemination of books and newspapers introduce people to words in printed form which they have never heard pronounced in their home environment". In other words it is quite likely that foreigners will pronounce words in the 'wrong' way, whereas natives on the other hand are more likely to have difficulties when in comes to spelling, since there are so many inconsistencies in it. The latter group of people are continuously exposed to the 'correct' ways of pronouncing words. Due to all the potential difficulties there are then, it has sometimes been suggested that a spelling reform of the English language would be an improvement. In this essay my intention is therefore to discuss whether such a reform is preferable or not and why. I will put forward arguments both in favour of and against a spelling reform, even though the latter ones are going to dominate. I find it important to reflect upon implications of actions taken in either direction. What happens in the short term as well as in the long term perspective if we decide not to change the spelling system? What happens if we do? Before I proceed to a discussion I will, in the following paragraph, give you the reader a brief historical background. Hopefully that will make things more interesting and easy to follow. Today, in the twentieth century, spelling is almost absolutely invariant. Earlier on though, in both Middle and Early Modern English, a limited number of alternatives were acceptable. Informal spelling was actually fairly common as late as in the eighteenth century and rather surprisingly different spellings could be seen even within the work of each writer (Barber, 1993). Milroy and Milroy (1985) both stresses the fact that the idea of an absolutely fixed spelling system is recent. They state that particular spellings of words nowadays are regarded as uniquely acceptable and that other possible spellings are being rejected as 'errors'. It is important, they mean, to bear in mind that the accepted forms are arbitrary and fixed by convention. No spellings are in themselves more logical than others. According to Barber (1993) a ruled language is one in which acceptable usage is explicitly laid down. He describes in detail how certain linguists in the past used to believe that rules and regulations would prevent the language from changing. However, as is generally known today, every language that is being used is in a perpetual state of change. In comparison with pronounciation spelling is here, naturally, the most uniform level of language usage (Milroy & Milroy, 1985). Since, then, the above discussed perpetual motion of the English pronounciation has led to a vast quantity of inconsistencies in our writing, it is getting increasingly hard for people to aquire proficiency in spelling. This should be taken seriously in a society where great emphasis is placed on literacy. It is regarded as highly important today being able to spell correctly. Looking upon this aspect in isolation a spelling reform of the English language could be motivated. As previously established there is, however, nothing that can prevent pronounciation from continuously changing and accordingly you should ask yourself whether it would actually be that much of an improvement. In one way it might be good for us in the future to recognise radical changes in pronounciation, since writing would make much more sense that way. As long as the present spelling system works out fairly well a reform would, however, in my opinion, be a disservice rather than anything else. As Milroy and Milroy (1985) much importantly point out our access to history is mainly through writing. In order for messages to be transmitted over time and distance in a clear and unambiguous manner it is essential that the spelling system is as uniform as possible. In other words it is dangerous, in the long run, to obstruct interpretation of preserved documents, books and so on. We have got to look after our cultural inheritance. There are some practical problems as well with a spelling reform that should be taken into consideration. First of all people from different generations would almost certainly have formed different opinions about the new rules. For quite a long period of time we would very likely see a mixture of different kinds of spelling, which is all rather ironic since it would make spelling even more difficult. The result could probably be compared with the non-standardised spelling systems of the past, which I have previously accounted for. Assuming that the younger generation would be more likely to welcome the new system, it would also be more difficult for them in the future to interpret and use old books, articles and documents. To take that discussion one step further it could also create unnecessary gaps between different groups of society, which I think is highly impreferable. Barber (1993) describes how the many differences in pronounciation that we have can be explained by both geographical, social and situational factors. Taking this into account it would be rather difficult to decide on exactly what changes that would be made in the event of a spelling reform. Who is to have the authority to make decisions about what particular pronounciations that are to be recognised in writing? How is it possible to arrive at a conclusion about what is 'correct' without being subjective? What we would witness would be a recognition of the pronounciations used by a rather large, but selected, group of society. This could be compared with the fact that Standard English in the late Middle Ages was the language of a small minority. The higher the socio-economic level of the speakers, the nearer their speech was likely to be to Standard English (Barber, 1993). It is from that period that we have inherited the prescriptive attitudes towards language, that today ought to be regarded as highly influential (ibid). The problem should not be exaggerated, since many changes in pronounciation are widely spread, but should not be neglected either. People's use of any language is highly complex. It is often stated that the English language is highly conservative, but there seem to be a lot of good reasons why. If we sum up what I have discussed in this essay there are obviously more problems than there are benefits with the suggested spelling reform, so for everyone's sake, let us stay conservative.

EE044	0	﻿ Taboo or Not Taboo The subject of swear words is always a hot issue to discuss and it seems to me that most people have something to say in the matter. Shirley E Peckham has written an article on the subject called "Cleaning up the language". In this article she clearly state her disgust with the language of young teenagers, which she believes contains too many words not suitable for her ears. I too feel that some swear words are not the prettiest words and that they are sometimes better left out when speaking or writing. What I dislike and oppose myself to is Peckham's attitude towards teenagers and their language and the method she implies is the most suitable for a "cleaning up". To begin with I must say that it seems that Peckham has no understanding of language as a process, she has at least not taken this in consideration in her article. Since language is a process and it develops concurrently with society and its conditions, the way we speak is also bound to change. New words constantly enter the lexical arena which means that old ones have to retire, some of the new words are widely recognized and are put in our dictionaries and others only stay for a decade or so. The impact and meaning of words also change; words that were hard and rude 50 years ago might not be that today. Thus can not Peckham expect children of today to speak as she did when she was a child and if they did their friends would probably think of them as a bit different. And we can not get away from the fact that some words will always be considered more obscene than others and the fact that some people will use them. This leads me to the methods that Peckham suggests are the most effective to use in order to get rid of this horrendous thing called swearing. In her article Peckham state that when she was young "specific instructions, firmly expressed, meant exactly what it said, to the letter". She also states that as a child she knew her place and was very steady because "she was boxed around the ears, well not quite, but the impact was the same". With these two statements, as I interpret them, Peckham therefore implies that since firm instructions today are not firm enough and not obeyed by those who receive them, a beating would have the same impact today as the firm instructions she got. This is in my opinion totally wrong for educational purposes. Any punishment, physical or verbal, are of no use unless the person to be punished really understands why the thing she/he did was wrong otherwise it will not have the effect a punishment is supposed to have. Proper explanations concerning the benefits in not using swear words and the disadvantages in using them combined with acting as a good role model and not use them yourself are the best solutions in order to do your part in this matter. Threatening and scaring children into doing what you want them to do will most likely have the opposite effect since children who do not feel secure will not do as you say but as you do and they to will end up bitter and with aggressive attitudes. Perhaps this is what happened to Peckham. In any case I think Peckhams worries are exaggerated and ignorant because her only concern seem to be her own interest in the matter and not the one of the teenagers. So if you hear young people swear you do not have to worry, and I will tell you why. First of all, just because you use a lot of swear words as a teenager it does not necessarily mean you will use them when you grow up. Secondly lots of people, young and old, adapt their language according to what situations they are in, amongst friends a more casual language is used than during a job interview for example. But if you are confronted with someone that has a bad language out of the ordinary and you feel that it could become a problem, explain why it can become a problem instead of telling him/her off. That will be much more appreciated and you will feel better yourself if you do not let it get to you.$$$﻿ DISCO'S OUT, MURDER'S IN. I have, since a tender age, been very interested in the Second World War in general and the Third Reich in particular. Besides having read a lot of books about the subject, I can honestly say that I've seen most of all TV-programmes broadcasted about it for the last 15 years. As far as I can remember there has never been such a multitude of programmes about WW II and the Third Reich, especially the Holocaust, on various TV-channels as for the last 1-2 years. In addition to that, we can also mention Primeminister Persson's Stockholm Convention and the Historic Museum's exhibition "The Holocaust Project". Why this enormous interest, both from the media and from the authorities, in WW II at the moment? Undoubtly, the reason that most people would give you is the cliched yet very true phrase "if we forget, it will happen again". Mr. Persson himself has stated on many occations that the reason he took the decision to order the printing and distribution of the book Om detta miNi Beretta (a basic, yet fairly well-written book about the Holocaust) was because a survey showed that Swedish schoolchildren had little knowledge about the Holocaust. Although the survey later was said to have been misinterpreted and that Swedish schoolchildren indeed had pretty good knowledge about the Holocaust, the book was a good initiative. Still, it doesn't give a full explaination to the question. In fact, we might ask ourselves why there haven't been any surveys of that kind before, why was it conducted at this point of time when the Holocaust-topic has gotten so much attention? Furthermore, it doesn't give an explaination to all the TV-programmes, many of them produced abroad. Does the Swedish Primeminister have such an impact on, for instance, BBC? No, hardly not. However, in a recent Swedish TV-documentary about the dubious "historians" that denies the Holocaust, prof. Jerzy Einhorn (survivor of the Holocaust) expressed his fear of what will happen when all of the survivors are gone, which inevitably will happen in 10-15 years, and there will be no-one alive to tell the story. This could of course be one reason for all the new documentaries, to record testimonies from the victims before it's too late, to prove the so called revisionists wrong. While this is yet another honourable cause, we cannot deny that over the years probably thousands of testimonies have been recorded on tape and film, all telling the same story about the Nazi-atrocities. With all due respect to prof. Einhorn, in which way will a testimony recorded in 1999 be more convincing than one made in, say, 1954? Yet another aspect that might explain this situation is the argument that there is still much left unsaid and that we still can find new and undiscovered material from the war. For example, in the decree of the Stockholm Convention that was held this month, the participants stated that they will work for and support that all archives from the war will be opened and research will be done. Eventually, there are still a lot of material tucked away, collecting dust in archives all over Europe, mainly in Russia but even in countrys like Sweden, for instance records of Swedish citizens serving in the Waffen-SS. Still, these demands about the opening of archives could be seen as another spin-off effect of the newly found interest in the Holocaust. So far, very few demands have been risen for the opening of archives until now, most people have settled for the huge bulk of information that nevertheless have been available. We must of course remember that for political reasons it was impossible to get hold of information from Russian archives until just recent times, and, for example, Swedish archives about Swedish participation in war-crimes are still classified top secret for another 15 years, but still, why is now the right point to rise these demands? Let's look at the situation from a Nazi-propaganda view, maybe at this point of time the international Zionist movement, together with the Zionist Occupation Governments (ZOG, a Nazi-term used to describe the western democracies) are disturbed by the awakening of racial awareness by European patriots and it is time to crush "The Storm" (a term frequently used by Nazis for the racial awareness that will inevitably lead to the race war) with even more lies and propaganda. Total idiocy, of course, but this might actually be the case - but the other way around of course. Look at what's happening in Europe right now, not only have the underground hardcore Nazi-movement gained in strenght, to the point where they actually can pose a lethal threat to individuals whom they dislike, but also to the parliamentary situation in Europe. As everybody knows, we have a scenario in Austria where, through a democratic election, we have right-wing extremists in the government. This, I believe, is the reason why we have this newly found interest in the Third Reich and the Holocaust. After having said for many years: "we must remember, or it will happen again", we are now forced to say: "we must ACT, or it will happen again". In conclusion, we are now facing a situation where the horrors of the Third Reich seem not so distant as they have been. At this point of time, Fascism is on the rise in Europe, most people are concerned and awareness about this things are, fortunately, spreading. This leads to a general interest in things that have been.
EE043	1	﻿ Shakespeare's Julius Caesar After "A very pleasing night to honest men" (I.3.43) - a night of thunder - Cassius comes to Brutus's house in the company of Casca, Cinna, Decius, Trebonius and Metellus. It is early in the morning the day for the assassination and they have come to discuss and plan the murder of Caesar. Brutus has just received a letter exhorting him "To speak and strike" (II.1.56). He thinks this is an urgent request to him from the people of Rome, but in fact it is Cassius writing: in this way he tries to persuade Brutus to join the conspiracy. The passage this essay is based on is Act II, scene 1, line 112-191. After a discussion about were the sun actually rises, Cassius wants all the conspirators to swear an oath. Brutus immediately oppose to this and his cause is clear: If not the face of men, The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse - If these be motives weak, break off betimes. ... (114-16) ... What need we any spur but our own cause. ... (123) The only oath that Brutus want is "honesty to honesty engaged" (127), because to Brutus, their reason for murdering Caesar is so strong and obvious that it does not need an oath in its real meaning. For him, the reason for the murder is the Roman people's state - they suffer - and he does not want them to live under these hard conditions. To him, the reason for the murder is that it is the common good and he wants the other conspirators as well as the public to believe that as strong as he does. This is also why he turns down the suggestion, by Decius and Cassius, that they should kill Mark Antony too. Cassius fear a "A shrewd contriver" in Antony (158) and he also trembles at the thought of what power Antony could get if they do not kill him. He is not aware of the fact that he "looks | Quite through the deeds of men" (I.2.201-2) twice, nor is Brutus, who says to him, both times, that he should "not think of him" (184). No one seems to understand, at this point, that Cassius justly feels the threat from Antony. If they kill both Antony and Caesar, their "course will seem too bloody" (162) and that is not the intention. This shall make Our purpose necessary, and not envious; Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers. (177-80) There is also a discussion about whether they should make Cicero one of them or not. Again it is Cassius that proposes and Brutus that rejects. Brutus always has long elaborated answers to Cassius's short, concise questions Cassius thinks that "he [Cicero] will stand very strong with us" (142) and Casca says: "Let us not leave him out" (143) and Cinna and Metellus agree. Brutus does not want him to join the conspiracy "For he will never follow anything | That other men begin." (line 151-52) Maybe Brutus thinks that not even he would be powerful enough to make Cicero a conspirator, for he makes it sound as if he had doubts about his own qualities as a leader, but he might not be aware of the others understanding it like that. Then Cassius thinks they should "leave him out" (line 153) and suddenly Casca sound as if he has never been of any other opinion than that of Brutus's and Cassius's: "Indeed he is not fit." (line 154). Cinna and Metellus do not comment on this, but contrary to Cicero, Casca is easily 'manipulated' and does not contradict the man he sees as the leader. Both these discussions reveal a great difference of opinion between Brutus and Cassius. They agree on one point and that is the killing of Caesar, but they have quite different reasons for wanting his death. Brutus loves Caesar as a person: if there were some other way of making away with the spirit of Caesar - what Caesar stands for - and, with that, the 'general suffering', Brutus would have chosen that solution to the problem, but as it is now, Caesar has to die, even though this means that Brutus will kill a friend, and a very good one, because he does not want the whole people to suffer because of one man's dictatorialness. The general good thus gets the upper hand in Brutus. We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood. O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit, And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it. ... (167-71) The major difference between Brutus and Cassius is that Brutus is an idealist. He feels as though it is his duty to kill Caesar, since so many people are suffering under his reign. It is 'cold logic' to reason like this - to kill a friend in order to relieve the suffering of a whole people - but this does not stop Brutus from murder Caesar. The picture given to the reader of Brutus suggests a very cold and determined man, but in fact, he is not as sure as he appears to be. The way he speaks about the conspirators as "sacrificers" rather than "murderers" (176 and 180) is a way to keep his bad conscience, for murdering a friend, at a distance. However, it does haunt him in the ghost of Caesar, which he sees before going out on the battlefield. (IV.3.279) Cassius, on the other hand hates Caesar on personal grounds. He has the opposite reasons for the murder compared to Brutus: he does not think of anyone else's good, but that of himself. However, he does say, when speaking of Antony: A shrewd contriver; and you know his means, If he improve them, they may well stretch so far As to annoy us all. ... (158-60) This hints that he might be considering the good of them all when proposing that they murder both Antony and Caesar, but it is not very obvious. Brutus is the altruistic one and this creates his anguish: he does know the wrong in murdering a friend, but at the same time he wants to relieve the burden from the people.$$$﻿Introduction Geoffrey Chaucer is one of England's most famous authors. His work the Canterbury Tales, is written in the East Midland dialect which was to develop into the English of today. (Burnley, 1983:145) Around 1387 (Skeat, 1965:5), when Chaucer wrote his Tales, the language - Middle English - had been and was under the influence of foreign languages (Barber, 1993:140) and in this essay I intend to study the different types of loan-words in the 'Prologue' to the Canterbury Tales. I will try to find patterns in the loans, for example if a majority of the verbs are of French origin or if there are semantic peculiarities, such as if all words about household come from Scandinavian. The concentration will be on words of Germanic origin to see if there is some connection with present-day Swedish or Icelandic. Then, if a loan-word is still in use in English today and also in, for example, Swedish, I will compare the two meanings and see if it is possible to show patterns in the development of the meaning of the words in the different languages. The part of the 'Prologue' that I have as a basis for this essay begins on line 118, where the Prioresse comes in. The acronyms PDE, ME and OE stands for Present-day English, Middle English and Old English respectively. 1 Method The first lines of the 'Prologue' is something which is known to most students of English at a university level: Whan that April with his shoures soothe / The droughte of March hath perced to the roote, / And bathed every veine... Therefore I have chosen to begin my reading of the 'Prologue' some hundred lines further down. I have looked up each word down to line 192 in an etymological dictionary (Chambers's, 1967) where I have found most of the words in the tables, even the foreign ones. Finding the meaning of words that have a totally new form in Present-day English (PDE call and ME clepen) would have been difficult without the help of George H. Cowling's glossary. The result of this can be seen in Table 1 (Appendix 2), where I have listed words from the 'Prologue'. I have also read chapter 7, 'Middle English' in Charles Barber's The English Language: A Historical Introduction (1993) to get material for the passage about Middle English. I have also visited some sites on the internet. (See references for address) 2 Previous Research on Middle English 2.1 Vocabulary The language around Chaucer was a language under strong influence of, above all, French. (Barber, 1993:151) However, the French of the Normans who invaded England in 1066 (The Battle of Hastings) was not the 'standard language' of France, but a dialect called Anglo-Norman. (Wilton) When studying texts written closely after the Norman Conquest (12th century) and texts from Chaucer's days it is easy to see the difference between Old and Middle English. The most influential language before the Normans came with their French was also a Romance language, namely Latin, which came together with Christianity in the seventh century.( Barber, 1993:107) The loan-words at that time had to do with the new religion - priest, mass and vicar, (Wilton) but since the Normans became more influential in society as a whole, their language came to spread out French and/or Anglo-Norman words in many vocabulary areas. (Barber, 1993:134) Some examples of these are the army (the word army, soldier, navy, enemy and peace), law (bar, judge, sentence, ransom and felon), fashion, meals and social life (coat, button, jewel, taste, appetite, toast, recreation, music and tournament), government and administration (crown, state, empire, royal and parliament) and art, medicine and learning (painting, image, anatomy, pain, story and prologue). (Baugh, 1993:165-168) As the language of the conquerors gained in prestige it became indispensable for the aristocracy (which is also a French loan-word) to know French. (Barber, 1993:134-5) However, the conquered people's language did not die under this pressure. The working class and the farmers - those who did not have much direct contact with the upper classes - continued to speak English (Barber, 1993:136) and these classes grew in impotrance after the Black Death that killed one third of the British population. (Wilton) Traces of this can still be found; one example are the words mutton and sheep. Mutton derives from the French mouton which also means 'sheep', but this hints that it was the Anglo-Saxons who tended the sheep and the French-speaking upper class that prepared and ate the animal. (Wilton) Other examples of pairs like this are wish - desire and doom (G) - judgement (Fr), but these words are more synonym-like. (Wilton)In the sheep/mutton example both words live on, but then there are other cases where the French word has replaced a Germanic one, for example crime (Fr) and firen (G). (Wilton) Then there is a third kind of change and that is when a French word has been put together with a Germanic one like gentle + man to form a new word. (Wilton) 3.2 Morphology The largest change in morphology, during the Middle English period, is the great loss of the Old English inflections. (Barber, 1993:157) Partly, this was due to phonological changes such as the dropping off of unstressed syllables at the ends of words. (Barber, 1993:157) The result of this development was that the speakers 'ended up' with many nouns and adjectives looking the same in nominative, accusative and genitive, cases which had had their own forms earlier. (Barber, 1993:157) However, there are some of these older declensions of nouns still living on, for example the plurals oxen and children and the mutated plurals feet and men. (Barber, 1993:158), but there is no trace for the plural -e added to adjectives (fair - faire). (Barber, 1993:160) 3.3 Syntax The vocabulary change, in turn, meant that the order of the words in a sentence became more important. Since it in Old English was possible to tell from the endings of the words which function each word had in the sentence, word-order was not very important. Old English had about the same freedom as Latin when it came to placing the words in a phrase, but when these endings disappeared users of the language had to begin to rely on word-order. (Barber, 1993:161) It was at this time that S-V-O word-order became the dominating one (Barber, 1993:161), but the V-S word-order (without an object) can still be found, as in: - I have already done it, said she. (Barber, 1993:161) 3 Discussion 3.1 Nouns If we look at the nouns having to do with eating we see that words like flesh and milk are of Germanic origin and oistre and sauce (App 2, p 12) are Romance (oistre originally from Greek). (Chambers's, 1967:444) ME flesh (App 2, p 12) meaning 'meat' is PD Swedish 'flosk', but the meaning has narrowed to now denoting only meat from pigs. An interesting words is mete (App 2, p 13) which has given 'meat' and 'mate'; two words nowadays denoting two totally different things. During the ME period mete could mean both 'food' (cf. Swedish 'mat'), and also the companion you shared it with, but now we have 'meat', meaning only a certain kind of food, and 'mate', friend. The first set of words is an example of narrowing. The mete encountered in the 'Prologue' means 'mealtime'. Words having to do with the parts of the body are of mixed origin, for example herte, mouth, brest and hand are Germanic and the Romance ones are lippe, eye and nose. (App 2, p 13) The animals mentioned are hound, fish, mous and fowel (App 2, p 13) and they are all Germanic, but the first three have connections with Romance languages. The word fowel is 'bird' in PDE, but the original word still exists in Swedish and Icelandic, with the same meaning. Almost all nouns concerning religion and learning are Romance: cloistre, nonne, monk and preest as is scole, (App 2, p 14-16) but not the book the pupils read in school. The explanation is that the Germanic peoples first wrote on pieces of beech (cf. (App 2, p 14 and 16) 3.2 Verbs The Germanic verbs are numerous. Examples of these are be, have, make, say, speak and see. The verb 'hunt' has the same form in ME as in PDE, but when Chaucer describes a monk's interests (line166) he uses the Romance word venerye (App 2, p 12) for 'hunting' (noun). This can be compared to PDE 'venison' meaning 'game' like in 'stock of game' (Sw. viltbestund). Verbs used in connection with the nonne and the preest are Romance and not very many compared to the Germanic ones. Romance examples are reserved and served (App 2, p 15) 3.3 Adjectives Examples of adjectives of Germanic origin are new, brood, old, deed and good. (App 2, p 10) Coy, simple, divyne, amiable, tender and charitable are Romance ones. (App 2, p 10 and 14-16) Swedish and Icelandic has preserved its counterparts to old, but only in the form of nouns: 'ulder' and 'aldur' meaning 'age'. PDE 'good' is 'bra' in Swedish. 'God' in Swedish is used in expressions like 'god mat' and not like PDE 'good car'. PDE coy means 'shy' (talking about a woman) and it comes from the French 'coi'. 'Simpel' exists in Swedish, but has a negative tone. The same goes for the Swedish counterpart of divyne which is 'diva', meaning the same as in PDE. Three words connected to each other (collocation) are poure, cost and spare. (App 2, p 15)The two first ones are Romance and the last one is Germanic, however they all have relatives in Swedish and Icelandic has 'spara'. 'Seemly' is a word that English only has in common with Icelandic, the same meaning in both languages. (App 2, p 10) The three colours, grey, reed and grene that occur in the text, are all Germanic. (App 2, p 10) 3.4 Prepositions All prepositions are Germanic, but on, in, and for has connections with Romance languages and Greek(on = ana). (App 2, p 9) 3.5 Pronouns The pronoun hir is 'hennar' and 'hennes' in Icelandic and Swedish. His is 'hans' in both languages. Hir derives from OE 'heo' meaning 'she'. (App 2, p 9) 4 Conclusions/Results When looking at the nouns that concern food it is easy to see that words denoting frequent parts of meals are Germanic (milk and flesh), while the less frequent ones are Romance (oistre and sauce). In this way it is possible to see what kind of food that was 'English' versus 'continental'. Of nouns concerning the body are also of both origins, but I think it is possible to say that the most important parts have Germanic words: herte, hand, brest and mouth. Other important words like ooth and world are Germanic too. The verbs follow about the same pattern as do the nouns - the most frequently used verbs are of Germanic origin and the less frequent ones are Romance. Marginal verbs, those which can be both main verbs and auxiliaries, are Germanic: be, have. Romance verbs are used when the author talks about one of the monks (served and reserved). Like the previous word class, the adjectives follow the nouns in the loan pattern: adjectives that are found often are of Germanic origin and uncommon ones are Romance. Coy is an interesting loan-word. Considering the meaning of the word - shy (said about a woman) - and the French and Scandinavian temperament respectively it would have been more logical to borrow a word with this meaning from a Scandinavian language. Nor is it very surprising that adjectives like amiable, tender and charitable are Romance when thinking about the different cultures and temperaments in France and the Nordic countries. Short, but not less important words, like prepositions and pronouns are all of Germanic origin. Having read and looked closer into only a smaller part of the 'Prologue', it is possible to do this summary: words that the Anglo-Saxons 'needed' before the Norman conquest are Germanic and words denoting something unknown up until the Conquest are borrowed from the language of the Normans. However, as we have seen, some Germanic words were pushed out of the vocabulary by French ones and at other times, the two words coexisted and still do. Swedish and Icelandic words that resemble their English cousins often have the same or similar meaning. 5 References Barber, Charles. 1993. The English Language - A Historical Introduction.

EE169	0	﻿ Please, show more about the starvation on the television! For about two weeks the television and the newspaper have had the terror attack against the US as their biggest news. You can't turn the television on without hearing about where bin Laden is hiding, how the US is going to find him and if the US is going to declare a war against the terror. It was almost 7000 people who died in the terror attack and everybody feels sorry for them. At the same time, 30000 children are starving to death, every day. There is absolutely no defence for what the terrorists did to the US, but it is time that we think about other problems. If you feel sorry for the relatives and friends to them who died in World Trade Centre and Pentagon, think about the persons in for example Buenos Aires, who has to go through a lost of a child maybe not only once, but twice. It is time that we fight against the really big problem; it is time that we fight against the starvation. In short, there is absolutely nothing you or I can do alone, to stop the malnutrition in the whole world. The hunger makes the children defenceless against every bacterium. But together we can give the children a better start of their lives, but people tend to forget about all the starving children in other countries. All we think of right now is the terror attack in the US. Things that are not shown on television we don't find as real. The starving children are just something we hear about, but we cant really imagine how it is like in the poorest countries. Therefore I think that all the countries that support the US should think twice on what they are spending their money on. If there are going to be a war, several innocent people will have to offer their lives. And what if this war against the terror turn out to be something much bigger, World War Three, for example. Do we want to offer innocent lives in a war against the terror, or is it better to try to save innocent life in the war against starvation? The children do not need much money at all to survive and I think that it is better to spend the millions this war will cost, to save these innocent children's life. All of you that send money to the victims of the terror in the US please don't. Or do at least send half of them to the poor countries fight against the starvation. If you are sending your money to the US you are helping them to build some new buildings. If you are sending them to children in need, you might save lives. We have to think about what the most important thing is: that New York will look the same as it did before, or if it is more important to save lives. My opinion is that there is nothing that could be more important than to save children's life, because they are our future. World Trade Centre was just a building. As I mentioned before, there is absolutely no defence for the terror attack against the United States in New York and Washington. But it could be an idea to think about that they that killed them and thousands of other people knew that this was going to be showed on the television. The murders knew one thing. This is going to be good televisions for several weeks. The ones who are starving to death are not thinking about the television. They are thinking about how they are going to find food to survive. After some they give up and die. Finally I would like to say that it would be good if the media could focus more on the starvation that continues in the poorest countries every day. As it is today, the starvation is set aside. The one who think that it is not real because it is not showed on the television need to think about what power the television has over our mind.$$$﻿ Evaluation - English, My English! It all started the first week in school after a long and joyful summer vacation the year of 1990. We all knew that something new was going to happen this year, we were going to learn a second language, but we didn't think of it much until that Wednesday. I don't remember much of what we did that first English lesson but I know that we learned how to say hello and my name is Ross and how are you. In my diary I wrote that day that we had started to learn English, and that it was fun. My parents have told me that I walked around the whole evening of that first English-learning day, saying hello and how are you, to my family. Yes, I was enthusiastic and eager to learn more then, and I still am. The years that followed that first year, my fascination for and will to learn English didn't decrease, as it did for some of my friends. No, I understood that languages was something for me, but I wasn't sure that I was a "language-person" until I had learned both Spanish and French without too much difficulties. I don't mean that I am a genius for languages, not at all, but I am very much interested of them. I have a lot of weaknesses, and perhaps some strength, and about them I will write now, as I have been told. I guess that I can comprehend most of the things that is spoken to me in English. But not so much technical language and other things that you don't hear much about. Of course I can basically understand what is spoken, but I don't have the vocabulary to understand technical language. And then we have the dialects. When I was in the U.S., Wisconsin, for a whole summer two years ago I didn't find it so difficult to understand what they said because they had no apparent dialect, but they talked rather fast and a bit "slovenly". But when I talked to a gang of youths from Leeds last fall I really had to concentrate on what they said, because they talked with a strong dialect. A "careless" dialect I would say, I had to ask them to repeat what they said plenty of times. Of course could that depend on that I'm not used to hear British English or other sorts of English, but American English. I like to read books in English. When I want to read a book written by a English author I try to read it in English, a book is better in its original language I think. Now I don't think I have any bigger problems with reading English, because I am rather used to it. But the first book I read in English, The lord of the Rings by J R R Tolkien, took me some months to get through. At the beginning I looked up lots of words in a dictionary, but then I stopped doing that, because you could understand the sentences meaning anyway and guess the meaning of the word. My strengths in reading is that I have read books in English for some years, so I'm not unused to it. The weaknesses I have in reading is that I tend to skip the parts in the book that I find boring, for example too long descriptions of something and technical things. I know that I might miss things good to learn about, but I have problems with reading those boring parts, I just skim through it. When I came home again after a summer in the U.S. I could speak fluent American English, or, at least, good fluent for being a Swede. (OK, I can't judge it myself, but the Americans I lived with were impressed.) But now when I haven't spoken English for more than 11/2 year, I feel that my speech is very rusty. I can't find the words and my pronunciation is terrible. But I hope I can make it work again, that's one of the reasons why I have chosen this course. I guess that I have a rather good vocabulary, but I want to make it bigger. And then we have the writing. I feel that writing in English isn't what I'm best at. I write ungrammatical and incoherent. That can be because I write a lot of letters, and they tend to be written in a more incorrect grammatical way and in "speaking-language". I don't really know why, but it's the same way when I write letters in Swedish. They tend to be more "informal". So I'm really in a need of learning how to write in a good English. If I have any strengths in English it must be that I dare to write, even if I know it might not be so good. I know that the person who reads it will understand, hopefully everything, what I mean, even though it's not a correct English. If I write essays like this I know it will be marked, and I want it to be. Because then I can see what I have difficulties with and do exercises so I hopefully have less problems afterwards. It's the grammar I have most problems with. I know that I have learned lots of grammar and that I practice some of it when I write and speak. But where the rest of the grammar I have learned is I don't know. It must be in a well hidden place in my brain. So, I need to find that place and I hope that the grammar lessons can help me with it. To refresh my knowledge of grammar. Yes, I have big hopes on this English course. I really need to make my English knowledge better. And I know that it is up to me how much I'm going to learn, I know. And I will do as good as I can. Because I need and want to get better.
EE040	1	﻿ Reflections on the V chip - problems, questions and hope In the article "Locking Out Violence" Ginia Bellafante writes about a possible solution to one of the big problems of today - violence caused by watching TV. Children see too much violence on TV and they start to think that it's reality and the proper way to act. The violence, which is often exaggerated, blunts them and they get difficulties in keeping reality and fiction apart. Also in Sweden many crimes today can be related to this lack of understanding for the difference between what happens on TV and film and in real life. I think this V chip is an exellent idea. It wouldn't solve everything that goes wrong in the world but it would help a lot of people and more importantly, it wouldn't do any harm. So I don't see any disadvantages with it, but I do however see problems. One of those is the problem of judging different films and putting them on a scale. The article mention the two films Terminator 2 and Schindler's list. The V chip wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these two films although they are very different indeed. They both have violence but there is no way they can fall into the same category. There is a big difference between glorifying violence like in Terminator and using it in a more educational purpose to create understanding and sympathy like in the film about the Holocaust. So I suppose there are different kinds of violence. And who are by the way the right persons to do this judgement? The V chip has however been critizised for other things than the problems of how to carry through with this. I can't help but thinking, when I read the article, that some people have to make objections to a new proposal like this just for the sake of it. No one, except for the broadcasters who might lose some audience, seems to be able to point out something that can really be shown as a bad effect of this. There is the discussion about if it is another form of censorship for example and a senator says in the article that the V chip would bring us "one step closer to government control of what we see on telelvision". I can not understand what censorship has got to do with it. The only censoring would be done by the parents and that is really the same as to say to the children "No, you can't watch this." Now surely, that is every parent's right, isn't it? And all the Government do is to offer the people to buy this. It's not as if they are forcing anyone to buy and install it. There is no control in offering a possibility. The broadcasters have also opposed to the V chip pointing out that they have already got a system that warns parents when there is an unsuitable show about to start on TV. But as the article so rightly points out the parents can't control what their children are watching when they're not at home. One question is of course if it will work. There is nothing in the article about how the suggestion has been met by the public. Are the parents positive to this? Would anyone actually buy it? Those are things I would like to know. And if someone does buy it then will it stop the children from watching too much violence or will they just go to a friends house or rent a video? Perhaps, but then at least it's not so easy anymore for them to watch violent films. In the article another person points out that most homes have more than one TV and that parents surely won't replace every one and that the only way then would be to chain the children to the sofa in the room with the V-chip-equipped TV. Well, yes. Or perhaps more easily lock the door to the room with the other TV. But then I wonder has it really gone this far? Why is not a no enough anymore? I just find it very sad that something like this is necessary today to be sure that our children do not become violent criminals because they have been watching too much violence on TV. And naturally all violence can't be blamed on television either. Not all people become violent criminals after having watched it on TV. Something else must be wrong too I'm sure. The president of Showtime Networks says in the article: "We have some serious societal issues here. The V chip seems like an overly simple solution to a very complicated problem." Maybe that's true but if it does help someone then why not?$$$﻿ When Harriet and David meet they know that they've found what they've been looking for. Someone with whom they can create what they've both been dreaming of and hoping and waiting for all their lives - a big happy family. But when the fifth child comes along things change and their happiness falls to pieces because Ben is not like them and he doesn't fit into their lives. They say he's different. But is he really different? And if so, then what is he different from? The main theme of this text is the meeting of two worlds, the normal and the abnormal, the known and the unknown, the civilized and the foreign. These worlds are represented by the family on one side and Ben on the other. By studying the setting of this text we can see how these worlds relate to eachother and to their surroundings. David and Harriet are different. That is stated from the very first page in this text. They are two oddballs who find in each other exactly what they have been looking for to spend their future with. They share the same dreams and beliefs. Their definitions of happiness are the same. But it must be sorted out - what does differet mean in this case? A contradictive sentence to what I've just stated in the first page is "They defended a stubbornly held view of themselves which was that they were ordinary..."(p.7). Ordinary. Isn't that the direct opposite of different? We must make clear that different in this case means not like most people in their surroundings while ordinary means old-fashioned. Then comes the fifth child and slowly tears the family apart with his violence, hate and cold, evil eyes. He is different too. But from what? There are several things in the text that show that the world outside this family bliss is changing: "[...]the greedy and selfish sixties[...]". (p.29) "The little town[...]had changed[...]. Brutal incidents and crimes, once shocking everyone, were now commonplace." (p.29) "Two peoples lived in England, not one - enemies, hating eachother, who would not hear what the other said." (p.30) Ben is greedy and selfish. Whenever he speaks it is to say things like "Give me this" or "Ben wants that". And he is selfish because the only reason he is controllable to a certain point is Harriets threat to take him back to the place that scares him. Later on Ben takes to crime and violence, robbery, rape etc. Without defending it in any way I have to say that it isn't uncommon, it doesn't take an alien to do it. The two peoples that populated England can well be represented by Paul, the youngest child who is the one who gets mostly effected by Ben's presence, and Ben. They hated eachother. So if Ben is part of this world, what he really is different from is Harriet's and David's family life. Maybe that's why everyone outside the family fails to recognize what Harriet so badly needs confirmed - that Ben is different. He doesn't fit in to their odd life but maybe he is just a contemporary figure that ends up in an anachronism. Their is another exaple of how David and Harriet are different from other people on page 8. David and Harriet are watching people at the dance enjoying themselves. "Both had reflected that the faces of the dancers [...] could just as well have been distorted in screams and grimaces of pain as in enjoyment". They see the world in a different way. They do not fit in. And they get a child that maybe does fit in to the rest of the world, but not in their lives. Harriet and David are different from each other too in some ways and that is also important for how they react to Ben and deal with him. They have for example different backgrounds. His parents are divorced while her mother seems to have everything she wants. Maybe that explains why David doesn't leave, although he thinks his wife has let him down. And Harriet blames herself for Harriet calls Ben an alien and spends hours trying to figure out where he comes from, who are the ones of his own kind. She tries to these two worlds to go together but David doesn't. They deal with this matter in different ways. Harriet wants to learn what is going on inside Ben's head, how he sees the world, what he thinks about. She also tries to make Ben more like them. She wants to teach him by making him watch her and Paul play and then play the same game with him. David just wants to get rid of him. He accepts the thought that Ben will never be like them. On page 13 it says "his wife must be like him in this; that she knew where happiness lay and how to keep it". When Harriet failed him in this matter by going back for Ben she made him very angry and disappointed. But instead of leaving her he burried himself in work which kept him from home all day. Why? Maybe because he knew that the damage was already done the moment Ben came in to their lives. Leaving him to die in that place wouldn't have their happiness.
EE560	0	﻿ The students of today is the future! In this essay I will give my arguments for giving university students grants instead of loans to finance their education. Let us start with the obvious, it is not very encurishing to start your working career in debts. That put a lot of pressure on young people to start earning a lot of money on an early stadge of thire career, and with todays problem of great unemployment and economical difficulties, it is not surtain that they will get a well paid job right a way. This is very dangerous, becouse it make it more difficult for young people to have the currage to go on with their studies at high levels. Students are, alreaddy afraid of not manage their studies at university level, as everybody else they are scared of trying something they might fail to do, and adding the fear of gettig them selves in debts, make it difficult to take the step into university studies, which is of sutch importants when appaying for a well paid job. An other reason why university students should be given grants instead of loans is that they might not afford (knowing that they later will be responsible to pay the money back) to loan enuogh money to be able to manage without working during the school semesters. If they were given a grant they wouldn't have to work during school semester and they would have a mutch better chance of doing well with their studies. An other reason why it is so important for students to feel that they have enough money is that thay are grown up now, and it is important for themto have a home of their own. As it is now students consider living with their parents, instead of taking loans to finans their own living. This is serious becouse the parents home is not always the best imviorment to study, and living by yourself is a great way of developing both independencey and socisl skills since you are more isolated you are forsed to meet people.) A student might even considering a school near the parents home, so that she/he can live at home during her/his time of university studies, and in doing so exlude all education at universities away from her/his home town. A third reason, is that giving grants to univesity students would economicly benifit the government, throuh not having to administrate all paybacks from former university students who have been given loans (usally this a very outdraw prosess since you only pay back a small part of your oan on every payback ocation). Society would also save money in healt care, since the students would be happier and therefor be more healty. One might argue that students would take their education more lightly if they did not have to finance it by themselfs, but today university studies are extreamly important if you wish to get a well paid and stimulating job in the future, and this is only getting more and more important among young people Young people are studying for more and more years of their life, this mean that the period they are lending money is getting longer and the period they are making money is getting shorter. This is perfectly natural, since employers need more and more educated employees in todays society. But one should be aware of the importance of young peoples possibilities to cotinue their studies at a high level, and not scearing them of by putting them in debts befor they even have had a chance of making any money. My edvice to politicas is to give students grants instead of loans to finans their university studies so that they: will have the currage to continue their studies at a high level, are able to consentrate on their school work, and to save government money. Students are the future, they are important, politic leaders can not neglect the future.$$$﻿ Abolishing of the death penalty In a lot of countries the death penalty is still in use. Many people are of the opinion that the death penalty is needed as the only right sentence for exceptionally cruel crimes. I do not share that opinion, mainly because I do not think that any person has the right to kill another human being. There are many reasons why I think the death penalty should be abolished. I will now put my arguments forward and explain why I feel the way I do. To begin with I don't think that any person should have the right to execute anyone. We are all human beings. An execution, or a state killing, is colder and more premeditated than any of the crimes committed by the convict. Even if a person has committed terrible crimes, and doesn't deserve to live because of all the horrible things he or she has done, it isn't right for any other person to take a life. If we use the death penalty for people who have murdered others, we are as bad as they are. It's not excusable to commit dreadful crimes but neither to execute the one who has. Nobody, either individually nor as a society representative, has the right to take another man's life, even taken in to account the seriousness of his guilt. I understand people, who are victims of cruel crimes wanting to see their attacker executed. I also understand relatives of the victim feeling that way, but I do not think that the death penalty is the right solution. When a person has committed a murder or anything like that, I totally agree on that he or she should be put away behind bars to pay for what they have done. Secondly I think that a person who has committed a dreadful crime should be locked up for life. I think it's too easy for murderers to get away with being executed, because then they aren't being punished for life like the victim and its relatives. The truth and the remorse remain even when an exceptionally dangerous killer is executed. Also I think it would be better trying to re-educate and rehabilitate the convict morally and humanly. What rehabilitation will be possible towards a dead man? Thirdly the death penalty is the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment existing and it violates the right to life. Not to mention that an execution is an act of violence, and violence tends to provoke violence. You can't prevent killing by killing. I also think it is the duty of every state to protect the life of all persons within its jurisdiction without exception. Executions, whether by governments or others, are equally unacceptable. Abolition of the death penalty is necessary for the achievement of declared international standards. People who support the death penalty are saying that it is too costly for the taxpayers to have the criminals in prison. The critics, on the other hand, have mentioned the economy as a strong reason for abolishing of the death penalty. Economic studies have shown that it is a very costly procedure to execute people, the way they do in the US for example. The cost isn't only financial, the imposition and infliction of the death penalty is brutal to all that are involved in the process. My final argument is based on the fact that innocent people could be executed and that is a risk we cannot afford to take. There is always a possibility of miscarriages of justice. The possibility of killing an innocent person alone justifies the abolition of the death penalty. Sometimes people are falsely accused of crimes they haven't committed. It has happened that innocent people have been executed. We are depending on judicial system; a mistake made by an inexperienced lawyer, for example a minor delay in producing evidence for the defence, can cost the defendant's life. This we cannot allow.
EE563	0	﻿I have always had difficulties with foreign languages, not only English, but also German and French. I think it is because I was too lazy in the beginning of language studies in school and lost the beginning stages. I had especially difficulties in writing and spelling, even in the Swedish language. It did not get better until about seventh grade. When I was about fourteen years old I went to England for a month one summer to learn English, but since I only had Swedish friends there I did not speak much English. Therefore it was good for me to go to America for a year, where I have learnt most of my English. Speaking is probably the area in which I improved the most during my year in America. I lived in a family, went to school all day and met friends in my spare time. Therefore I spoke English all the time. I think I am (or maybe was) fluently speaking, but not grammatically correct all the time. In America people find it important to know how to speak in an amusing, interesting way. That seemed more important than the grammar part of the language. In Sweden we usually do not want to speak about ourselves and what we are good at. That is something they seem to concentrate on in the American school, encouraging the students to speak freely. I found that they had many courses for that, like Speech and Drama for instance. Unfortunately I did not take any of the courses Speech or Drama in High School. I thought it would be scary, and when I found other courses I rather wanted to take, I took them instead. Now I wish I had taken one of those courses though. During my year in America I of course heard a lot of English. I heard the language all the time. Just to be in Sweden and listening to the radio or watching TV improves the listening skills I guess, but it is not the same. I listened to the radio and watched TV in America too, but I also heard people speak. I think that is the absolute easiest way to learn a language, to listen to real people talking about real things. If you do not understand something you just ask and get an explanation in English, which I find very educating. Listening and understanding is the other area in which I improved the most in America. I did some writing in High School, but it was not required that much, not even on tests that always were multiple choice. In the Swedish school we of course have had some practice in writing, especially for the national tests for instance. I find it difficult to write and see if it is correct and even if I sometimes can see that I have made a mistake some were, I do not know a better solution and I have to leave it. It is really frustrating at times! Reading was not a big part of the American school I went to. We did read some though, but I consider myself a very slow reader. I love reading books in Swedish, but when I try to read in English I usually get to tired and never seems to get trough the book. The books we read in the American school often were much simpler than the ones we read here in Sweden during the English education. The reading skills should be easy to practice just by reading books, but if I am going to read a book for fun, I of course take a Swedish one out of laziness. Hopefully my reading skills will improve this semester. Since it was five years ago I was in America I have forgotten a lot of my English. It is probably somewhere back in my head though, and I hope I will remember most of it during this semester of English studies.$$$﻿The task for this week is to write down some words about my experience of the English language. When I had the first contact with it, for how long I've studied English, how I feel about it and so on. There is, of course, no literature to account for so Ill just get down to business. y first memory of a language not familiar to me is, quite naturally, English. I can almost see myself sitting in front of the TV, watching The Muppet Show. Amazed and thrilled by the dolls but also with the strange language they used. My father read the white text with the black background (subtitles) just below Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and all the rest. I quite early understood that the text was somehow connected with the language the Muppets used but I could not really figure out how. I learned how to read rather quickly, because of my curiosity of what they were saying in that strange language on the TV. My father was relieved at not having to spend the whole Saturday night reading out loud and I was happy of understanding all by my self. When my best friends parents were away, I read for my friend instead. (Sometimes a little modified. Children are evil) Then the school started and we met the English language in 3rd grade for the first time. I don't really remember much of this first contact. I guess it was just like any other subject - an obstacle between the footballmatches during the breaks. When I bought myself a computer in the middle -80s I understood for the first time how important and global it was. Since I watched a lot of movies and TV-program plus studying in school it was no problem understanding the English used by the computer programs. I spent uncountable hours playing various games, which gave me a good sense, of how the English was presented in written form and it also gave me a quite large passive vocabulary. (I said I spent uncountable hours playing games. That is not true. I still do it and enjoy every minute.) There is something else that has taught me a lot of English and that is role-playing games. There was a time when we played several times per week, fascinated with rules, statistics, descriptions and battles. Everything written in English. I still can't understand how we could memorize a rulebook, which consisted of hundreds of rules and diagrams in a matter of days. And that is exactly what we did. We memorized the rules. I believe that I still can reproduce almost everything written down in the sourcebook of our favourite games. In these last years other interests have replaced the role-playing part, which has nothing to do with English but there has sprung up a new source of English training. The Internet. Almost every site is written in English, even the Swedish ones, which gives you a great opportunity to learn more in a fun way. I enjoy reading and studying English quite a lot compared to other subjects. And I know it is because I feel the necessity of being good at it, which I don't feel when learning about mathematics, physics and so on. I need to be really motivated to learn, maybe I'm even more dependent on motivation than most others. But sometimes even English becomes boring. Once my English teacher in upper secondary school told me and my deskmate that we were the laziest students she'd ever had. The following week our German teacher said almost the exact same words... But amazingly enough we were the only two who got the highest note. In English that is. Let's not speak about the German language. y real weakness in English is, like most people I guess, the theoretical grammar. I'm really bad at remembering different word classes and clause types. Unfortunately I can't keep them apart Swedish either so that makes it even more difficult. This affects my writing in a significant way, because the demand of completely correct written English is greater by far than the verbal presentation. If I had any real strong sides I would say my spelling. (Which is probably the only strong side in my whole academical knowledge.) I guess I'm quite good at reading and understanding texts too, due to my long history of playing English games, both on the computer and the role-playing games as I mentioned before. But I have not got any real experience with my English except some week long holidays at the Mediterranean but I know that I will, after a short time be able to speak and understand an almost completely correct English both grammatical and in pronunciation.
EE564	0	﻿ Why we need students grants Being a student in Sweden means going through some hard financial years. The choice one makes though, does not only mean temporarily less income, but also a huge rate of the future income directly drawn to pay off the loans for years to come. This paper will deal with the problems connected to the issue. Firstly I will discuss the troublesome fact that a degree does not guarantee neither getting a job, nor an improved wage if one gets a job. Secondly I think that Sweden ought to show appreciation to those who are eager to learn, and realise how important it is to keep our intellectuality high. The third topic will be not risking people overworking themselves by having jobs and studies at the same time. I will sum up by presenting a possible solution to the following problem with people misusing the system if grants were to be introduced. I will start with what I hold as the most important reason of having students' grants. People who want money do best not going to the university at all. During the years of studies one has to cope with a lot less than what one could get at a low-paid job. Getting into the market after university studies, there is little difference in salary between jobs, which demand a degree and those not. Of course there are well-paid professions, but the overall difference is negligible compared with the situation in other countries. Including the loans, you end up at about the same level if you have a long education. This leaves us the reasonable conclusion that many of those studying, do it for pleasure and personal development, since the money profit is a joke. I do not imply that these are insufficient reasons, but I do feel that there ought to be some difference on the pay roll. I also think it is important to show the awareness of the advantages of an educated nation. If Sweden wants to stay at the top of the world in economic and social domains, we need to keep up intellectually with the other industrial countries. I think this involves increasing the salaries too, but I will not get into that discussion here. Giving people a chance to get an education without ending up in a difficult situation financially, should make a significant difference in itself. A risk that follows the economic disadvantage of being a student is the fact that many students both work and study at the same time. I can assert that it is rather tough to keep up in school, and in the acquiring of knowledge one does not have the time to become at all full-filled. I know that there are lots of students having problems grasping what they should in their education, and of course, having an income has to be the main issue. As a last topic, I would like to come with a suggestion how to solve one of the greatest problems of having students' grants instead of loans; removing the risk of people taking advantage of the system. If there were no demands on the students, many people would probably just fool around studying a little bit of this and a little bit of that. To make this impossible, there could be loans from the beginning, that were to be written off when a student got a degree. There could be a certain amount of terms paid for, as there are today, so that it would be impossible to stay in the system forever. For those never reaching a degree, the loan would stay as a good reason not to give up. Today if you move abroad and do not pay tax in Sweden, they do not draw money to pay off your loan. I suggest the opposite; those who take their knowledge away from the country, would have to pay for their studies even if they have received a degree. Why should the state pay for something that is not of use to the country? To sum up, I feel that Sweden would benefit in many areas by removing the only reason there is not to study: the loans. I think it is of great importance to keep developing your intellect to be able to develop psychologically. I therefore think Sweden would do best realising the need to show appreciation of those interested in getting an education by making the studies free with grants. To restrict the use of the grants, both to sift out the ones not serious in their studies and to reduce the expenses, I suggest that only those actually reaching a degree get the grants. To keep the country with what I reckon is one of the most aware people on earth, I think education has to be a central tool, available to everyone.$$$﻿ The Swedish purchase of Gripen fighter planes. Introduction Sweden is right now in a process of upgrading the airforce with new Gripen fighter planes, which eventually will replace the old Viggen system. The idea of a new aircraft, to modernize the Swedish Airforce and later take over after Viggen, came in the late 70's. But it would take several years before the first prototype stood ready. The criteria was that it had to be smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter, harder to detect, with a better range and load capacity than Viggen. Another criteria was that it had to be nicer to the environment. After a lot of discussions and pie throwing, the contract for these new fighter planes to the Swedish Airforce were signed in 1982. The amount of aircraft in the order have been modified a few times and finally ended up at about 220 planes. The first operative division were placed at F7 in 1993. I think we needed this new Gripen system to replace the old Viggen, and to keep a modern airforce. Since Gripen is an instable aircraft it can turn in a smaller radii than most other aircrafts. And by instable I mean that it takes many cooperating computers just to keep the plane in the air, flying straight. In the future we might be able to use it in peacekeeping missions, maybe under the UN flag. In that case I think it would be reconnaissance missions, such as photographing strategic locations and troop movement. Since 220 planes are to many for the new military organization, we might be able to export the Gripen system to other countries and in that way make some money for the Swedish defense. South Africa have already bought a couple of fighters, and wemight have some other potential buyers in Austria and Chile, were we have been showing our new system. Austria have bought Swedish fighters before and they say that they are very pleased so far with the service and social contacts. As an answer to a possible counter-question I would say: -No, I don't think that every country who buy Gripen will use it for peacekeeping missions. But I still don't think that we, by exporting the Gripen system, encourage warfare and invasions. We only sell an airplane, not any special weapons, missiles or bombs for example. Those things they have to buy from other countries, just like we do, and that would be their job to stop unauthorized countries from buying these kind of weapons. I don't know if this is such a smart expression by the Swedish minister Goran Persson, but this is roughly what he said during a press conference: "If we don't sell fighter planes to them, they will get it somewhere else". That might be true. And in this case Sweden doesn't have anything to lose; we have to many Gripen planes, so why not sell them instead of having them standing useless in a hangar. This plane will last for many, many years to come, since you just have to maintain the body of the plane and then simply upgrade the software in it, such as the guidance system and flight system as a whole. This is pretty easily done since the Gripen planes consists of about 40 computers. Since this is such an advanced aircraft it must be limited not to do more than 9 G:s, because the pilots can't handle so much more and certainly they can not take as much G:s as the plane can. Due to all the crashes and delays many people think this whole project has become much more expensive than it was budget for, but they are so wrong. In reality, it became cheaper than expected. And since there have been a couple of crashes, people have had doubt about how good it really is. But, I say but again, almost every new airplane in the stage of development have crashed once or twice, because of so called teething troubles. You learn by you mistakes. Just look at the last Swedish system during development, Viggen, which made even more crashes than Gripen during it's first years. The first crash with the Gripen came when the pilot were going in for landing during the sixth flight. Another example is the American F-16 and the stealth fighter F-117, which have gone down a couple of times and still does. Despite of the cost for the Gripen project, we still have a fairly modern defense in the army and navy. The navy has just got a new ship called YS2000 and a lot of new material have been bought in for the army. This might show the rest of the world that "little Sweden" can do it on our own.
EE565	0	﻿ ENGLISH, MY ENGLISH! Evaluating my own English is definitely not an easy task. I cannot say I have spent much time evaluating my skills. All I can say is that I've always felt pretty good at each and everyone of the four skills we are asked to discuss in this assignment. What I have learned since I started this English course is that there is much more to it than just being able to make yourself understood. When I really start to think about it, questions arise in my head. Do I write in a satisfaying way? Are my speaking abilities as good as I believe they are? Am I good at following an English speaking person? When it comes to reading, what are my strengths and weaknesses? In this essay I'm going to assess my strengths and weaknesses in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. When I'm listening to an English speaking person, do I have any problems in understanding what is being said? I must admit that my listening skill is at a very high level. I am never completely at sea when listening to someone speaking English. Of course it might depend on the subject which is spoken about. Do I have poor knowledge in a certain subject? I'll probably have to concentrate a bit extra to understand. Being surrounded by English speaking people naturally helps the ability to listen. Because of the fact we are obliged to speak in English at this course, I know my listening skill will improve even more. What are my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to reading? The subject being brought up is again the factor that decides weather my reading skill is good or poor. A weakness has therefore to do with my vocabulary. I am able to read a text and get a quite good understanding of it but experience frustration over having to look up quite a lot of words. Reading a novel is hardly ever a problem because of my satisfactorily general knowledge in the English language, which is a strength in my reading skill, but when it comes to reading technical language for example, I immediately notice vocabulary as a weakness. Developing my vocabulary is a goal to strive for, and I can tell you I aim high. Not being able to read the financial pages in the Times without having to look up every other word is a weakness I have to get rid of. Are my speaking abilities as good as I believe they are? Speaking English is what I have always referred to as my most developed skill. Since I started this course I must admit I do not feel as I did before. Speaking to friends in US and England over the phone has never been and still is not a problem. But what I have started to realise now is that there is more to it than being able to talk about everyday things with people I know. My communicative competence becomes poorer when I speak about things I do not really know much about, the US government for example. Of course that would be the case even in Swedish if I spoke about quantum physics, but the main difference is that a part of my weakness in speaking deals with doing spontaneous translation in English. I need to improve my strategies to say things even though I do not know the words. Although my strength is my ability to make myself well understood when speaking there are things in this area in need of improvement. Do I write in a satisfaying way? Making myself well understood through writing is a strength of mine. I love writing, which I believe is a reason for my abilities to automatically be fairly good. My main weakness is grammar. I feel my grammar is not bad enough for my produced texts to be totally incomprehensible but for various reasons I believe my grammar is in need of improvement. One reason is that I believe that an improvement can lead to a development in my ability to vary my writing a lot more and that my writing will be more effective. Poor vocabulary is again in need to be mentioned as a weakness. It is important for me to realise I have both weaknesses and strengths in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. This is the only way to start improving them all. Through this essay it should be noticed that my strengths in all four skill is my fairly good knowledges in the English language, which I got from studying the English language, but also from living in two English-speaking countries. My weakness contains grammar which affects writing and speaking, vocabulary which really concerns all four skills. Not having the ability to do spontaneous translations is another weakness that affects my speaking skill. It remain to be seen whether I can improve both weaknesses and strengths. Like I said, I aim high.$$$﻿ What about Systembolaget? I thought it would only be fair to give my opinion on the much discussed topic of "Systembolagets" significance, both considering the issues of alcoholism and free enterprise. Since the discussion is so hot right now, it is in everyones interest, to speak their piece. So in the name of democracy I will give you my piece. Systembolaget is a great institution in Swedish culture, it has existed since somewhere around the 1950s and has always been trustworthy. I believe that keeping Systembolaget would be a favour to the Swedish nation, and to its inhabitants. First of all I'd like to point out that hardly anywhere in the world, one can purchase alcohol with such great variety of quality spirits, beer or/and wine, as one can in the Swedish Systembolaget. This is so, due to the fact that Systembolaget is a monopoly franchise with a lack of competition. The market is then friendly and withholds great variety. The prices, however, can be thought of as to excessive. I very much feel that it is the price one simply has to pay, if the high quality is to be maintained. I understand people who don't agree with me, people who argues that alcohol should be sold in ordinary stores. It is a fine democratic thought. It wouldn't be better though. Think about it. Wouldn't liquor become a commodity like any other? I believe it would. And by becoming that impoverish the market so almost only standard brands would be available. The lesser quality alcohol would be more common and even cheaper, and the alcohol of higher quality would be noticeably more rare, and naturally a lot more expensive. That's not the way I like it. Look at Denmark there they have very few brands in their supermarkets. Cheap? Yes!, good? Not particularly, not at all in the same league as the Swedish Systembolagets. If we move forward to the question of whether alcoholism would increase if we turned to an open market or if, in fact, there would be less problems caused by alcohol in a more open environment. I don't think things would change at all. Why would they? The core of the problem of alcoholism lies in the fact that alcohol exists. Also that it's been drunk for thousands of years. It has been in our culture as long as we can date it back. The only thing that could decrease the consumption of alcohol is if it was made illegal. But then again that would never happen, since such a large amount of tax-money comes from Swedens strict alcohol policy. The whole Swedish society would anyway protest such a motion and it would never win any political ground. If anything should be done about Systembolaget it is having it open on Saturdays. That is tried in chosen towns, but I think they should just keep it open in all towns. Otherwise Systembolaget is open Monday to Friday. People who don't like Systembolaget often uses that argument to make a point. The argument being, of course, you can not go there everyday, which restricts your individual rights, or something like that. I find that being a big heap of horse-manure, if you excuse the metaphor. Anyone with at least intelligence below average can plan the week so that time is set aside for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. 559 As a final subject there is the moonshine. Do people drink moonshine, well of course they do. Is that related to Systembolaget by any chance? In some aspects it is. However, I think that is the same as with the issue of alcoholism, it wouldn't really matter either way. Hearing me say that it wouldn't matter either way, may cause you to think "then set it free, you have no argument". Look then to my first argument and you will see that it is the only vital argument in this entire affair. The restaurants, night-clubs, pubs and such will still be there. When you conclude this it's fairly easy to see where the common sense is. In this case of course, in the keeping of Systembolaget. Seeing it as an undemocratic institution can never be done with seriousness. With some planing you will have time to buy what you need during ordinary open-hours. Finally, the variety of flavours and brands will be uncompromised by the greed of, as the Americans say, the almighty dollar.
EE566	0	﻿I started studying English when I was ten years old. It was a sign of growing up; you were old enough to learn English. We started off with some simple words as "I, you, he and she" and as the time went by the words became complete sentences. My friends and I used to try to speak English with one and other in our spare time, in spite of the lack of words it was really fascinating to communicate in another language. A hole new world opened up for me. I remember the feeling when I understood some of the words they were saying on the telly: I could understand what Laura Ingalls said in "The little house on the prairie"! That was a satisfaction! Unfortunately the teachers I had in English weren't the best, the lessons were very traditional: listen to the tape, imitate, read the text and do the exercises. It grew quit boring after some years and my interest in English decreased. I wanted to learn from more authentic situations, like talking to each other, writing letters (to real people!) and watching movies without Swedish subtitles. When I was thirteen I went on a language travel, and it was then I started to appreciate the English language and see the opportunities in knowing the language. I didn't learn as much as I thought I would, but what I learned came from real situations and the greater part of my knowledge of English today is thanks to that trip. After my teacher exam I'm planning a new trip to the USA, to study or to work as an au pair. In school I've always been the typical average pupil in English. I've always got a grade "3", and I regret that I didn't spent more time to achieve better grades. I'm planning to change that during this English course. y ability in listening to English is pretty good when I'm having a conversation with someone, I don't have difficulties in understanding the person. If I'm listening for a longer time, for example a lecture, it demands more concentration and it's easy to loose attention. One thing that I'm hoping to improve is the ability of catching what the lyrics are about in English songs, this is something I found really hard. My reading skills, I think, are good. It takes a little bit longer to read in English that in Swedish, of course, but that is something I can work on by reading more English books. I can't read in English when I'm very tired either, because then I would loose the context. I try not to hang up on difficult words when I read. You may discover that my writing isn't the best. My spelling has always been terrible. I hope to improve in spelling and get a stronger self-confidence in writing. My lack of words becomes apparent when I'm trying to express myself, as you may discover in this essay. Writing is something you should learn early in school, I think, to be better in expressing yourself in a more variant way. My speaking in English is okay, I think. To speak English is what I've been practising the most. Not in school but to talk to people when I'm abroad. The talking I did in school come from the book and didn't have very much to do with real life, conversations that didn't make any sense. My pronunciation really improved in my stay in England, though I today mix British English and American English. Maybe that's a sign of to much watching TV, but I think I've learned allot from American TV-programs. Now, that I'm using the English language more than I used to, it comes to me how much I've lost during the years that have past since I studied English. I'm getting aware of how important it is to "up-date" your English all the time, because it still is "the Worlds language". It is a language that everyone should know and feel secured in.$$$﻿I think I am rather good at English, especially grammar and spelling. Perhaps I'm not so good at talking English. I think talking is the most difficult of the four skills: reading, writing, listening and talking. Reading I think is the easiest thing to do, mostly because then there is time to look up words and phrases I don't understand. Most of the times when I read something I don't understand I try to figure it out by looking at the context or at least try to get an idea about the meaning of it. If it is a keyword in the text I usually look it up in a dictionary. There is time to do that when I'm reading. Usually I try not to use the dictionary because it creates a distance to the text and I don't like that. So if I can't figure out the meaning of the word, and the word doesn't seem to be important for the understanding of the text, I just skip it and keep on reading, but if the same word appears over and over again I'll look it up. Sometimes when I don't understand a sentence it's because I've thought a noun was a verb and then the real verb doesn't fit in or the sentence sounds absurd. But after having reread the sentence I can see where I misunderstood. Writing is quite easy, too. Like when I'm reading I have time to use a dictionary. My experience from past writing is that I usually don't make so many spelling mistakes. Most mistakes I make have to do with the syntax. I often place words in the wrong order. Especially the adverbs, I don't know where to put them in the sentence. I either think they fit in nearly everywhere or nowhere in the sentence. Another thing I have some trouble with is the register. Sometimes it's difficult to find the proper word to use. The third of these skills, listening, I don't think I have any problem with either. I don't always understand every word or, to be honest, rather often I don't understand every word, but I don't think of that as a problem. I don't have to understand every little word to understand what someone is saying to me. This goes as long as the one who is talking to me isn't talking too fast or using a dialect. It's easy to understand British and American English. Australian English isn't that difficult, but Irish and Scottish English are very troublesome for me. Talking is the most difficult of these four skills, because it has to be fluent and accurate at the same time. My biggest problem is the fluency. I can talk to myself quietly inside my head and everything runs smoothly but when I try to say it aloud I stumble and loose endings and so on, but I guess it is because of nervousness and that I'll get better at it if I practise it a lot. Pronounciation of some words can be difficult, but I often avoid using words I can't pronounce. I know that I'll never learn how to pronounce them if I don't give it a try, but I still keep avoiding them. Sometimes I can't find the correct word for what I want to say, but most of the time I can go around it or explain what I mean using body language or words that mean nearly the same. And as I've written earlier I have problem with the register. It goes for both writing and talking. Many of these weaknesses I think have to do with my small vocabulary. I understand a lot of words but they belong to my passive vocabulary, they aren't in the vocabulary I use when I am talking. The things I need to work on are the syntax and my vocabulary. I need to learn to use more words and I need to learn when to use them. And last but not least I need to practise all four skills, especially talking.
EE519	1	﻿ "Why spoil a good mother to make an ordinary grammarian?" Although many schools for women were opened during the 19th century and the educational standards improved, not everybody liked the idea of women going to school. It was not only men who opposed to this idea, but also other women. The following words are written by a woman who, like most of the population, believed that women were naturally inferior to men and had an innate tendency to make mistakes and to lack self-control: "There is a natural inferiority of mind in women-of the intellect." During the 19th century differences between the intellectual capacity of men and women were frequently discussed, resulting in arguments claiming that women were not suited for the same type of studies as men and should therefore concentrate on studying, if anything, how to behave as hostesses and how to find a suitable husband. I will try to explain what arguments were used for and against education for women. I would like to start with the medical arguments for and against female education. Although there was not much research done in the area of the brain capacity of human beings and even though many of the references were vague, there still were many medical arguments against education for women and girls. It was, for instance, argued that the intellectual capacity of a human being was completely dependent on the size of the brain and due to the fact that women generally were, and are, smaller than men it was fairly easy to assume that they also were less intelligent. This argument needed no medical evidence since the fact very easily could be proven; by comparing the brain of an adult to one of a child it was simple to see that: The larger the brain, the cleverer the individual. This was one of the main arguments for men being more intelligent than women. To be on the safe side and to once and for all prove that the size of the brain was an important factor when determining a persons intelligence quotient craniometry, that is cranial measurement, was used. The brains of well-educated and respected men were measured after their death, and when the weight of their brains were compared to the brains of people thought of as less intelligent it was discovered that the brains that belonged to the men considered more intelligent, were heavier. This time it was anatomically proved; intelligence was connected with the size of the brain. Another argument, for that this must be the case, was that women were assumed to lack the ability to be creative and to make judgements of their own. Since none of the great authors, composers or artists were women, for instance were men like Shakespeare, Mozart and Raphael mentioned, this fact was used as a strong argument for male superiority in thought and creativeness. Women were also said to be unable to possess inventive thoughts and since their minds were regarded as less original they could therefore not produce anything like, for instance, great art. Women were, on the other hand, considered being superior to men in areas such as sensitivity, imagination and intuition but since these qualities were not thought of as highly as, for example, creativeness they were not considered very useful and were certainly not an argument for studying. As a final medical argument against female education, I would like to stress the fact that it was also believed that women who studied had overdeveloped brains. Studying could cause illness and if the worst came to the worst, it could also lead to that a woman no longer would be able to have children. The arguments for formal education for women were usually fewer then the ones against, but there was one person who made his voice heard in favour of the women, namely John Stuart Mill. He did not believe that there was a connection between the size of the brain and a persons' intellectual capacity. He claimed that if that would have been the case, it would have resulted in that small men were less intelligent than large men and that the human being would be intellectually inferior to large animals like elephants and whales. edical arguments were not the only ones used for deciding whether women should go to school or not. Since schooling was considered a way for girls to obtain social rather than intellectual skills, the issue could also be seen from a social and an ethical point of view. The 19th century woman was often referred to as "the angel of the house" and it was her duty to take care of her home and to look after her family; education was only seen as a waste of time and as something a woman would not have any use for in her married life. Mrs Sarah Ellis writes in her article from 1838: "...how much do most young ladies learn at school, for which they never find any use in the after life..." At the end of her article she stresses the fact that a woman's place is in her home or by ill people. Mrs Ellis continues by writing: "There is but a very small proportion of daughters of farmers, manufacturers, and trades-people, in England, who are ever called upon for their Latin, their Italian, or even their French; but all women in this sphere of life are liable to be called upon to visit and care for the sick..." As a final argument against female education I chose one used by 19th century anthropologists, who had studied primitive societies. They had come to the conclusion that women were not as clever as men due to the fact that no societies were governed by women. "I look around to the varying conditions of all parts of the world, and in no race, nor country, nor tribe, nor remote island...do I find an instance of woman having the upper hand, and reducing all the males to subjection." This phenomena was explained as a natural law. It was claimed that men and women had developed in different directions and should therefore stick to tasks that fitted their respective mental and physical abilities. Among those in favour of formal education for women and girls were, for instance, the newly-rich. These people considered education as something important since it made it easier for them to fit in into their new environment. These were the main arguments used for and against female education during the 19th century and luckily much have happened since those days.$$$﻿ The V chip - only useful on one kind of violence? Today it seems like most people have some sort of opinion about children watching television and whether we think it is good or bad, or educational or not, I think we all can agree on that the amount of violence received by many of the programs is much too high. To prevent young viewers from being affected by this type of unnecessary violence the so-called V chip will soon be launched. This computer chip, which is to be installed in the television set, will block out all unwanted programs and will therefore also help parents to control the TV-habits of their children. So, what programs will be rated as violent and is it really possible to give violence a number? In her article "locking out violence" Ginia Bellafante brings up this question. She says that the V chip would for instance not be able to tell the difference between films like Terminator 2, which is totally based on violence and Schindler's list, which also is a very frightful film, although in a completely different way, and would for this reason probably not be rated as violent as Terminator 2. First of all I would like to try to define violence which in my opinion can be many different things. Most people only see the physical side of violence and therefore associate it with weapons, blood and a violent use of language. Violence can also be of an other kind, namely; psychological. This sort of violence come in many forms, for instance when people are being threatened, ignored or put down. Psychological violence is usually much harder to recognize since there normally are no visible signs of abuse. People who are being subjected to this kind of violence are likely to have inner wounds, such as a low self-esteem, instead. To me violence can also be seen from a third point of view and by this I mean a disturbed, or violated, picture of our society. Many television programs today, mostly soap operas and talkshows, give a very distorted view of what life truly is about. Especially children are affected by this since several talkshows indicate that it is fully normal to have sex at the age of twelve, preferably with your best friend's boyfriend and that there is nothing wrong with lying and taking advantage of each other. What can we do to delete unnecessary violence? According to people in favour of the V chip this is not a difficult task, simply install the computer chip and you no longer have a problem. This might work very well and it will certainly block out films such as Terminator and Alien, but what about important and educational programs like the news? Our world is not always as peaceful and pleasant as we would like it to be and with wars going on in many countries it would be very hard to put a number on every single feature of the program. It would also be interesting to know how sports would be graded. Young viewers, especially boys, love to watch sports programs like boxing and wrestling and many of these children have idols among the sportsmen. Entertainment of this kind will give the wrong impression of how much you actually can hit a person without seriously injuring him or her. In Sweden these shows are not as common as they are in the US and I can only relate to how I, at the age of fifteen, reacted when I saw wrestling for the first time. Not until I had watched the show a couple of times I realized that these people were acting and I can only imagine how even younger children react to this sort of entertainment. Finally I would like to point out that violence does not only occur on TV but also in real life and it is not always possible to protect children from being exposed to it. They encounter violence in places like the playground, at school and also at home and what in my opinion is more important than the V chip is that the parents, instead of just blocking unwanted programs out without an explanation, try to explain to their children why people sometimes behave a certain way
EE410	1	﻿ English, My English Introduction This essay shows upon the strengths and weaknesses of my English, divided in four skills: listening, reading, speaking and writing. I have in certain areas presented a solution to my problems, my weaknesses. I've also mentioned what I want to acchieve with this course and what to do with my acquired English. Writing I've always been better expressing feelings and thoughts in the written form than in spoken word. I think the reason is that when I write I can take a break from the words and come back later and correct the wrongs, use different words and phrases, really think through what I want to say, one thing you can't while you are speaking. But as I write as I think, and think as I speak, the words doesn't always come out right, grammatically and spellingwise. When I write poems and lyrics a fluid language and knowledge of the words is very important. So, even though grammar is very difficult and sometimes incomprehensible, it is of extreme importance that I study it thoroughly. Speaking y heart throbbing at the speed of light, face turning red, and self-confidence getting weaker by each heartbeat. That is how I would describe myself minutes, seconds before I am to speak in front of a big crowd. Since English isn't my native tongue, my fluency, along with my limited vocabulary, is the bigggest problem. The lack of word knowledge, knowing the Swedish words in English and the right way to use it, I feel is very hampering when expressing my feelings and thoughts. I also found that my thoughts differ from my words, so the spoken word is something that I don't master at this point. I can only hope that it's something that I can improve, that I'm not stuck with this social handicap. To improve on my pronunciation I'm reading out loud from and old Time magazine, practising my accent. I have found that Swedes often tend to talk with an American accent, which I find sometimes irritating and sometimes amusing, imitating their heroes in Beverly Hills, 90210 or Days Of Our Lifes or some other TV-series. My goal is a mix of Peter O'Toole, Malcolm MacDowell and Alan Wilder (former member of Depeche Mode). You can call it a slightly overclass, old-fashioned English accent. Listening When the subtitle is removed and I have only to rely on my ears listening, instead of my eyes reading a text, I usually understand everything except for the odd word here and there that's not in my vocabulary. Where I'm staying at the moment there is a English newschannel that I've started watching, so I not only listen to English, I get up to date what's happening in the world from an English point of view. The best thing would of course to spend some time in an English speaking country. To really dig into the language, discovering the little nuances that separate the native from the tourist. Reading Except from one or two books read in high school, my reading habits has been limited to Swedish books. But as a part of the literature course, I've read two short stories and a novel and beginning on another. I've also borrowed three books by P.G. Wodehouse, finished one and halfway in on the other. Since the language in the latter books is old-fashioned and filled with lots of upperclass slangwords the big picture is rather clear, but the details that increases the understanding of the text is harder to grasp as they don't turn up in the dictionary, being short for something or having a different meaning than usual. Conclusion I have to improve my speaking, mainly in large groups. My writing must be improved upon so my lyrics and poems reaches the level of accuracy that I want. That is my primary goal with this course, to improve my writing. So grammar is something that I have to study with the utmost attention, how boring I may seem. To achieve a larger accuracy writing English, reading books and listening to English programs is a step in the right direction. Constantly being exposed to the country's language is the best way to acquire another language.$$$﻿ Money, a symbol of happiness? There is one main focus in the society of today and that is money. Getting more money, losing money, the use of money, the lack of money. So in this essay I will point to the different aspects of money, the use of it and what it can lead to. I will also point to certain things to start to change our views of money. It is easier to measure happiness and success when you have something that symbolises all of these things. Our symbol is money. We are constantly reminded of the importance of money when people in developing countries are starving and lack access to water, the number of homeless people in industrial countries is slowly increasing, hospitals not being able to give proper care to patients, schools suffering from lack of funds that interfere with teaching. All of this when executives of multi national companies collect sevenfigure paycheques. You can clearly see the shift in balance. What can you do with a salary of $5 million that you can't do with a $2 million salary? You may point out that there is much responsibility and stress in to top of large companies, therefor the large sum of money given to its bosses. But is it fair to give that much money to people that have made that choice of stress and responsibility, when other people don't even get the chance of choosing, and get little, if any, money? I don't think there is anybody that thinks different, from a human value point of view. But that point of view is not always used when looking upon money. All you can think about is what you can do if you had the money, or reversed, what you can't do because there isn't enough money. It permeates the entire society, or should I say Western culture society, although it has spread like a disease to other continents outside North and South America and Europe. Even into places not at all connected with money, like the Shoaling temple in China. Even those old institutions, one never thought would be adapted to capitalism, are being swept along in the tide that is capitalism. While these ancient pillars of wisdom are evolving into a money-based system, the society is being divided into three groups; a social elite at the top of the pyramid, more and more separated from the common people; In the middle of the pyramid you find the middle class; And the working class is situated in the lower areas of this power-pyramid. The distribution of money is reversed, with huge sums given to the top of the pyramid, the middle class taking what they can get their hands on, and the remains thrown to the masses like crumbles from the king's table. If this regression is to continue, we may in the near future equal money with life and prosperity and increasing crime and bad health with poor people, people fighting to get their hands on enough to stay alive, robbing from each other, killing each other. As the situation is now, all criminal activities can be linked to money, in a direct or indirect way. Crime is directly connected to money in that way that you either want money or something that is very valuable, something you can't buy. In that quest for money, people get hurt. Victims suffer both physically and mentally damages, while the criminals can be sentenced to capital punishment in many countries. All of this for pieces of paper that we decide are important. I think, that instead of dedicating our short lives to the search for money with all its hidden dangers we should pursue personal happiness oppose to the longing for more and more money that is generated. But as long as the symbol of money stands for success and happiness, we are stuck in old habits. We should try to distance ourselves from the money, realise that it's just a piece of paper, a symbol. That it's not in any way connected with happiness. Then, and only then, we can start to develop the idea of equality for all. Conclusion We have to change the current system unless we want larger differences between rich and poor. If we want total equality for all we have to start by changing the view of money that most people have. That of ownership. You don't own your money, you're just borrowing it for a while.
EE569	0	﻿I started learning English when I was about ten-eleven years old. I went to school in Germany by that time. I remember that me and my classmates had the opportunity to choose between French and English as the new foreign language. So I chose English, as I thought it would be the most useful language to learn. It was very exciting at the beginning to get to know a completely new language. One year later me and my family moved to Sweden. In my new class the pupils had been learning English for two years so I was one year behind. That wasn't too funny, but I did my best and at the senior level I had caught up with the other students. English was my favourite subject at the senior level. I especially liked writing and reading. That was because I started reading fantasy-books in Swedish. It was a very excitig series and the continuation hadn't been translated in Swedish, it only existed in English so I started reading the English books. I quite soon realised that it suddenly became much easier to write in English because I was reading English books, so I enjoyed writing in English. At the Swedish Gymnasium I sort of lost interest in English because there were so many other subjects to keep in order. I found the English workbooks boring and I wasn't that fond of glossery either. I remember that we had a national test once, I think it was in the second year at the gymnasium. Almost the whole class got very bad results, including me. We had got very little time for the test, I think nobody had been able to finish it. English was definetely not one of my favourite subjects anymore. In march 1998 I went to England for the first time of my life. The students who were interested at my school got the opportunity to go to Wakefield as an exchange project. Every student stayed with a host-family and went to an English school for two weeks, either to a small compulsary school in a place called Ossett or to the college in Wakefield. That was a rather interesting thing as the English school system differs quite a lot from the Swedish system. However, coming back to the English language, it wasn't that difficult to speak English with the host-family, though I was very nervous at the beginning. But I got used to it after a while. One thing I noticed was that I sometimes had some problems with using the correct English phrases, like to say "pardon?" when I didn't quite understand something. In the beginning I translated things directly from Swedish instead, so I said "sorry, what did you say?" (which is not correct, I suppose, and probably even can sound impolite to Englishmen.) I also had some problems to understand when someone talked very fast, had an accent or used a more formal language. I felt most comfortable using the English language among people who were about the same age as me, and in situations when things were't focused on the language all the time. Most of the time it was no problem to understand what people were talking about, but as I mentioned earlier, it depended on the situation. When somebody asks you something and expects you to answer, in a way that makes sense, it's not enough to just have heard the later half of the question. Thinking about the pronunciation, I don't really think that's a problem for Swedish people in general. I think it is a great advantage that films are shown in their original language in Sweden. I hear English every day, on television, on the radio, at the cinema. Every Swede does. I can compare with the Germans (as I still go to Germany every year) and I think their English sounds much worse than when Swedes speak English. Of course I'm no expert, but I think it makes a big difference that they among other things dub films to German in Germany. Talking of my pronunciation, I have problems to pronounce what I call "difficult words". And I can't speak fluid English, so of course I still have a lot to learn. I think that I mix up British and American pronunciation and that's probably not very good. In the media I think American English is more common and that's probably why I don't stick to the British English I learned at school all the time. I don't have very much problems to understand a text written in English, but there are always certain words that are new to me which I have to check. My weakness is that I don't always check the difficult words because I think it interrupts the reading. Usually, it's possible to understand what a text means anyway. But I would need to get to know much more formal words, and how to use them. I actually don't really know what my weaknesses are in writing. I quite like writing in English but I don't do it very often. I suppose that I express myself incorrectly sometimes and that the direct translation from Swedish to English can be wrong in many situations. I don't think I use the grammar correctly either, but I'm no expert so I don't really know. There is probably always more to learn!$$$﻿ Park your car Did you have problems finding a parking spot for your car this morning? Was the traffic intense and all you did this morning was standing in front of red lights, starring in the number plate of the car in front. I have the solution for your problems. I know it will not be easy but my advise for you is to leave your car at home and ride your bicycle to work instead. The nature has taken a lot of damage the latest decades and scientists expect that man slowly kills the possibilities of future life on earth. The forests are dying and the polar ices are melting and many people believe that this is the result of too big industries and too much car use in the western world. Today we cannot survive without our cars - or can we? Think about all the people in the world that do not have any cars. Are they more unhappy? Of course not. People who live close to their jobs can easily and with great benefits take their bikes to work. Likewise can people with a long way to work travel collectively. Here thought I am going to concentrate on why people should use their bikes instead of cars when going to their nearby job. A bicycle is very cheap. In Uppsala one can easily find a used bicycle in good condition for between 500 and 1000 Swedish crowns. One can use the bicycle at an unlimited amount of time without having to pay anything. It is practically free to go to work on your bicycle. The parking problem is another aspect you do not have to think about with your bike, parking places for bicycles is always free. There is no need to even mention how much more expensive it is to buy and own a car. As a result of too little exercise people in the western world is becoming heavier and heavier. We know that we do not move enough to keep our bodies in good shape. Despite this facts most workers drive their cars to work in the morning without winning a great deal of time. If everybody would leave their cars and take their bikes to work everybody would become fitter and the air we breath would become cleaner, witch also would make us healthier. It is not just the single individual that would save money while using his/her bike. Think about how much money the government would save when everybody were healthier. When we talk about the money the government would save, think about all the car crashes. Indeed we would be forced to deal with more bicycle crashes but they are rarely mortal. Thousand of lives would be saved. Eventually even the production in society would increase. If everybody were exposed to fresh air for half an hour each day before work, they would become much happier and could be able to work harder and more focused. We would become much more creative at our jobs and in our spare time if we saw more of our town and nature every day of the year. Today much talk is about thinking in environmental aspects. I believe we would feel pretty good with ourselves when we knew that each day we contributed to a cleaner world. However some new problems would occur in a bicycle dominated world. Many bicyclists today do not follow traffic rules. There is a possibility that some sort of traffic anarchy could be the result if too many bikes covered the streets. This should not have to be a problem if bicyclists were informed of their responsibilities against each other. When the number of the cars in the cities would be dropping the cyclists could move to the streets and since a bike is so much smaller than a car the expected chaos would probably never occur. Another problem that many people would complain about is the fact that one cannot really pack so much things on a bike. This is really a problem if you have the habit of buying food on your way home from work. We solve this with the cycle cart. Do you not feel tempted to let your car be tomorrow morning? Think about all the things you can do for the money you will save. Think about the nature you saves and think about all the fresh air you would be exposed to. Naturally there would be some problems if we left our cars, but the arguments for the bicycle is so heavy that at least my car will be left in its garage tomorrow. My advise is to dust of your bike, fill the tires with air and get out and stretch your legs.
EE414	1	﻿ English, my English! It has been two years since I last studied English, that was in the last year of upper secondary school. In some aspects it feels like I have developed my English since, while some other qualities I will mention later have declined somewhat. When it comes to terms of writing I really feel it has been a while since I composed for example an essay... Anyway, I will try to present to you shortly how I personally experience my skills in this beautiful language. To start with listening I have to say it varies a lot how well I perceive and understand English spoken around me. There is of course the difference of dialects depending on where you are or what television/radio programme you are listening to. Some times, while listening to the television since I have not had the opportunity to live in UK for any longer time, I find it very hard distinguishing the words in British speech. Probably this is due to the fact I mentioned above, that I have not spent enough time in a British environment. On the contrary, American English is, to a very large extent, what we hear on Swedish television and so it is "easier" to understand. Not that I am saying that I always grasp the connection anyway, but I think the occasions are more rare when I do not understand American English. Another contributing reason to the above mentioned is that I last year lived in an American family for a period of six months when I spoke English to them daily and watched English television. I think this affected my ability of listening, but even more it improved my speaking skills which I am now going to discuss. Speaking English in general I feel quite confident doing. I do not have any problems what so ever making contact with people using the English language. This confidence I have achieved mainly when I have been abroad and naturally forced to use the language. In school I often got cold feet when we were supposed to keep a conversation going. With my high demands I wanted it to come out perfect - I thought the fluency should be there only I opened my mouth. But of course it was not,- it never is if you do not practice the language. I think I learnt that being abroad, just the fact that it does not have to be perfect as long as people understand what you mean. So in that sense I am not as afraid of speaking any more. But in some situations that require more specialised vocabulary or just a broader range of vocabulary I can feel that I lack confidence a little bit. Vocabulary in particular but also grammar are weaknesses of mine, but the good thing about speaking is that you can more easily than when writing avoid what you do not master so well simply by choosing another way to say the very same thing. There is also a negative side to this, I have found studying myself, and it is that you easily stick to the words you already know without putting much effort into learning new ones. That is why I think keeping up with the reading is very important to learn new words. I have always been very fond of reading and actually consider it to be one of my best skills. Of course reading English literature results in a lot of looking up words, but I do not mind that because I know it is useful and I need all the vocabulary I can get. I think reading is in close connection with writing. That is, you benefit from having read a lot when you are supposed to try and express yourself in written context or when it comes to proper spelling, which is quite a tricky issue. I would like to call myself a quite good speller, but English is a language with queer spelling. Lately I found that my spelling is not as good as it used to be, an indication, I am sure, that I have read too little English during the last year. This is even more underlined by the fact that I found it pretty hard writing this essay. Finally I would like to say that it has been a pleasure writing this essay. It has made me bring up my weaknesses such as lack of vocabulary and certain grammar skills, but it has also reminded me of things that I am good at. Regarding the reading I am really looking forward to having to read novels instead of, as it often turns out, not having time to read them. I know that I need that as well, to practice reading in order to improve my skills.$$$﻿ Why spoil a good mother to make an ordinary grammarian? Until the middle of the nineteenth century female education in Britain generally took place at home. While the sons of a family mostly were sent away to school to receive costly education, girls were basically taught social skills in the home by the mother of the family or a governess or in some cases in local church schools. Anyhow, it was quite an informal education. During the last decades, though, an opinion had emerged among reform-friendly people that girls and women should be given formal education more or less equivalent to that of boys and men. Soon enough, this was possible owing to the new forms of secondary schools that were founded in the 1840s. This started other processes as well, such as a debate on whether women should be granted admission to universities and colleges or not. Accordingly, these reforms and suggestions to reforms provoked lots of discussions and many voices were raised over the subject formal female education. My aim here is to give you an overall picture of the different opinions on this matter. One group generally positive to formal education for girls and women was established middle class families. This because they could teach their daughters necessary social skills at home and also thought that the girls would need proper education to be able to become suitable wives and mothers capable of teaching their children good morals. This social group also felt the threat of the newly rich trying to join them on the social ladder, - they felt that they had to protect their social superiority. To be able to ensure this superiority, they needed excellent governesses to prepare their children, and especially sons, for school. This demand resulted in the founding of a college for educating governesses, and once this was established it was evident that also women teachers needed further education, and that the whole system for girls schooling was insufficient. Another category arguing strongly for formal female education was that of feminists and other reformers. They claimed that the superficial education given was completely useless. Women should have the right to the same standards of education as men. Society would benefit from educated women as well as it benefited from educated men. Another point they made was that an educated woman would be able to support herself if she never married. Even though these two groups had strong arguments and actually managed to develop female education, the greatest number of arguments represents the opinion against female education. To begin with, there were those who used this ethical argument that a woman's lot in life is to exist for the sake of others. Her aim should be to be the embodiment of unselfishness. Furthermore it was considered that education should "prepare the individual whom it influences, for filling her appointed station in the best possible manner" (Ellis, p.1) In other words, Ellis considered it completely futile to send girls to school to learn things they never would find use for later in life. She goes on explaining that in school we learn to compete and be selfish, while in real life (in the 19th century) qualities like that were hardly desired in women. Also when it comes to the achieving of social skills she gives a long explanation why the home is preferable to the school: "In cultivating a taste for what is refined and beautiful, in the acquisition of general knowledge, as well as in that of easy and agreeable manners (...) it is impossible to imagine a young girl more advantageously situated than in a well-regulated home, and surrounded by an amiable and well-informed family (...) (Ellis p.6) Among all those ideas opposing that women undertake the same higher education as men there was the common belief that men and women had different, innate, intellectual qualities, and that women simply were not meant to interfere with politics or other things that demanded constructive thinking. Both men and women supported this belief, we can tell from this quotation from a woman: "There is a natural inferiority of mind in women - of the intellect (...) we are under your feet, because we cannot stand upon our own." (Burstyn p.15) It was also considered that women totally lacked creative powers. This was proved, they thought, since there were no great female artists like Shakespeare or Mozart. Because of this, it was very rare that women got the chance to receive higher education. People reasoned that since women still were not capable of doing any creative work, why waste money on educating them? Something else supporting this idea was contemporary anatomical studies, or perhaps even more the conclusions anthropologists drew from them, that intelligence was in proportion to the size and weight of the brain. This was obvious since children have smaller brains and undoubtedly are less intelligent. As we all know, men's brains are larger and heavier than women's and so it was "proved" that women were less mentally developed than men. By this argument they wanted to show that woman should not undertake the same education as men, because she did not have the capacity to do it. oreover, there were arguments opposing higher female education based on the fear for what medical consequences it would lead to for the woman. It was said that "The logical, philosophical, scientific woman is not the ordinary type; she frequently - we say it with all delicacy, and yet truthfully - departs from it in her physical as well as in her mental characteristics." (Burstyn p.17) Note the indication on physical disabilities. This was a general understanding these days, that when women exhausted their brains, it had a negative effect on her health, and in fact, this could also make her infertile. There was of course no way this could be scientifically proved, but that fact was effectively disguised by the prudishness of this time, the Victorian era. It was not a topic suitable to discuss openly, and therefore it was supposed to be understood and accepted without further inquiries. Beneath all these arguments presented, there is one main, underlying thesis, namely that allowing women formal education would result in a change of the ideal of womanhood that existed during this time. This ethical argument is very basic, declaring that according to natural laws women and men had different premises, and women were supposed to have a moral and spiritual influence which would be destroyed by an education equivalent to men's. In conclusion, looking at these different aspects on the establishment of formal female education, it is evident that those fighting for it had a huge opinion against themselves. The arguments against female education were in many cases the reflections of this era, believing in the female role as the one of a house angel, with social and moral skills as the most cherished attributes. However, those working for female education gained ground, a lot owing to the tendency of middle class families to educate their daughters.
EE415	0	﻿ Echelon - Eavesdroppers Galore Privacy, freedom of speech and freedom of opinion are some of the most jealously guarded rights of people in democratic countries all over the world. Democratic governments, at least those in the 'western' world, are presumed by their citizens to adhere to those basic principles of democracy. Citizens who have suggested that 'Big Brother is watching us', have generally been dismissed as paranoid conspiracy theorists. As it turns out, they may not have been too far from the truth. The last few years have shown news items about a global spy network, nicknamed Echelon, operated by the US National Security Agency with the co-operation of the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Echelon is a fully automated intercept and relaying network that listens for certain keywords and catch phrases in Internet and telephone traffic, satellite communications and radio transmissions. If a transmission contains a keyword that the system is set to look for, it will be forwarded to a human operator for further scrutiny. The system was originally devised to gather signal intelligence from the east bloc during the cold war, but has grown enormously in scope since that time. It can be used today for completely different tasks, including industrial, financial, and political espionage against virtually every nation, business or individual on earth that has access to a communications network of some kind. The inherent dangers to such a system should be evident. The dangers lie not so much in the way Echelon is used today (although it is hard to determine the extent of its use; the nations involved are very secretive about its functions and how they use it), but in how it could be used. Claims are being made that the five nations trade intelligence information gathered through Echelon with each other, to the extent that they actually spy on one another's citizens. In effect, this would mean that in the case of the NSA, the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States has been completely bypassed. A citizen of the United States should not be subject to investigation unless there is probable cause, and even then, he should not be subject to a search of his person or premises, nor should he be tapped unless so ordered by a court of law. Echelon taps everybody, all the time, and there is no one to turn to with complaints. The NSA does not spy on its country's citizens, but e.g. the UK does. The UK then shares the information with the NSA, leaving the issue of legal jurisdiction muddled. Should these allegations of crimes against the constitutional safeguards prove correct, one could argue that the totalitarian system of government in Orwell's '1984' is unpleasantly close. We might not be controlled by Big Brother yet, but there are alarming tendencies. The only way to foil the Echelon network is to encrypt any and all information that is transmitted electronically. Strong cryptography is essential for online privacy. The best known cryptographic software available to private consumers is PGP, Pretty Good Privacy, written by American programmer Phil Zimmerman. PGP is free, easy to use, and offers good privacy for Internet communications. When Zimmerman first released PGP to the public, he was sued by the American government on the charge that releasing such strong cryptographic software to the enemies of the United States was a threat to national security. The charges were eventually dropped, but the international version of PGP does not offer as strong cryptography as the one for use in America and Canada.. Apparently, the NSA does not wish to be impeded in its eavesdropping. Echelon is designed specifically to eavesdrop on everyone that uses any form of electronic communication. Its operators seem to be less than interested in following the laws of their respective countries. It is a serious threat to individual as well as corporate privacy. Should the allegations currently lodged against the Echelon operators turn out to be true, the only right thing to do is to move for immediate termination of the network in its current form. The violation of privacy inherent in the system far outweighs any advantage.$$$﻿This is an essay about my English competence at this point. As an introduction to the topic I'm going to give you some background information about my experiences with the English language through the years, from the start in Primary School and till today. Then I'm going to make a conclusion and evaluate the knowledge and skills that I have gained from my English education and experiences. The skills are divided into the following areas as writing, reading, speaking and listening. I started to learn English in 4th grade in Primary School, and I remember that I was really excited about this challenge to get the chance to learn a foreign language. In the beginning we were learning English mostly by singing and playing. I liked it very much and it was a wonderful start to get acquainted with the language before starting to concentrate on writing and reading. Later when we had got some basic knowledge and could use some common phrases, we were able to set up sketches and scenes in the class. These scenes were often dialogues collected from our English Textbook or certain situations like for instance at breakfast, in the restaurant, in a shop, at the zoo etc. It was fun and we got the opportunity to learn to speak in an active and different way, which got us to see the clear context instead of only reading the texts in the books without any connection to real situations. Our teacher always spoke as much English as possible in the English lessons and that was also something that made us pupils more interested and trying to do the same. In Secondary School the English studying was getting on a higher level and with emphasis on writing, reading and grammar. We read a couple of books and articles to write reviews on. The homework often consisted of a text and words, and the common way we got examined was of writing sentences with the words to show the meaning and get them in to context. This time was good practise for my reading and writing but I was lacking the speaking part. Our teacher didn't give us much opportunity to speak and use our English in the classroom. She was very energetic and ambitious, but I think she forgot the most important part - speaking. My experience tells me that you improve your skills and vocabulary a lot by discussing and explaining things to other people. I have been travelling some in Europe on holidays but I haven't spent any longer time in English-speaking environments, which involves that I have mostly been practising my English in school. The English education in Upper Secondary School was primarily based on a lot of grammar, reading and writing. We worked often in pairs with grammar tasks and read texts aloud to each other. But now I have realised that we didn't really improve our English that much, because we just did the assignments automatically and didn't get any feedback from the teacher. Here was the speaking also the part that I lacked, because we didn't really speak that much English and that also included our teacher. This involved that I didn't improve my speaking much during this time, because I wasn't challenged to use the language in real situations. I have always liked learning languages and especially English, which was the first foreign language I got in contact with. I have also studied German and Spanish, which have helped me a lot to learn the grammar and then to compare the differences between the languages. So I think I have quite good knowledge of basic grammar in English, spelling and translating. But I'm not used to write essays. I have studied at the University for two and a half years and in some courses we have had literature in English. I like that and don't think that it's that difficult, maybe some terms. I'm used to read quite a lot of books, but not English fiction though. I thought it might be tough, but I like it and feel already that I have improved my comprehension a little and learned many new words only by reading some novels the latest month. I feel that my understanding of listening to English is pretty good, and one of the reasons is that we are surrounded by English most every day on television, radio, Internet, music etc. I can manage with my English today but I would really like to go abroad to improve my vocabulary, which would make me feel more comfortable and fluent in speaking.
EE510	0	﻿Introduction In this essay I am going to try to evaluate my English, by looking separately at the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. I do think that it is very hard to look at my own strengths and weaknesses in an objective way. Since I tend to be either very critical or too optimistic when it comes to my own abilities. Listening I have had the opportunity to hear spoken English from different parts of the world in all my life. As I live in a country that does not use the opportunity to dub foreign movies, documentaries, talk shows etcetera. Another opportunity for me to practice my English, was when my fathers wife, an airhostess, came home from her trips to Bankok with pirate copies of popular American movies that were subtitled in Thai! y major problem related to my listen ability is that I sometimes get caught when the person that I am having a conversation with, or am listening to utters a word or an expression which meaning I do not understand. Naturally it is quite hard to listen to what this person has to say and at the same time try to figure out what he or she already has said. Overall I do feel quite confident as long as the speaker does not have a dialect that is too different from standard English. Speaking The curricula which the Swedish English teachers are supposed to follow says that a pupil who wants good grades in English has to speak the language when he or she is in class. This has not, however, been the case at most of the lessons that I have attended. Approximately, I spoke English about five hours each year in upper school. Most of this time was linked to the obligatory oral presentations on various subjects that we did every year. All this has contributed to the insecurity which I have always felt when I speak English. And I do feel that this is my weakest part compared to the other three: listening, reading and writing. Reading At the age of thirteen I went on a vacation to Wales with my parents, after one week I had read every single book that we had brought with us. There was nothing left to do but go to a local book shop. Eventually, I discovered that it actually was possible to read in English. A couple of years later I realised that the jokes in a book written by a English speaking writer were much funnier and better preserved in the original publication. Since 50 percent of the books in my bookshelf are written in English I have to consider my reading ability as good. Because to me the most important thing is not to know every single word in a book. Instead it is much more meaningful to understand the coherence. On the other hand I am aware of that this unwillingness to look up unfamiliar words is a weakness. But it is easy to lose the rhythm and flow if the reading is interrupted. And if the story is in the middle of something crucial, then it is absolutely impossible to stop. Writing Reviews and reports of books were the most common ways of practising writing in my school. According to me the written word is the best way to express thoughts and feelings and therefor I would have liked to produce something outside the usual predestinated pattern. It seems to be very important to use a correctly written English. The reason for this is that a person who fully masters this skill, equally masters the most important components of the language. I can not say that grammar ever has been my strength. To cover this I used to claim that I learned every foreign language which I know by ear. This does work to a certain limit; then it does unfortunately not work anymore. I came to that point and discovered that I had, and still have, much to learn. I truly enjoy writing, it challenges me. And this is my strength, because if there is optimism in a text I think it shows.$$$﻿A lot of people have been asking me: "Why are you taking an English course? You have been to America, you must know the language already!" Well, for one year I have spoken and heard English every day but that doesn't necessary mean that I know everything about the language. I speak English almost fluently and I understand just about everything. But there is a lot more to learn... I divide my English learning into two phases, before and after my visit to America. For a year I worked as an aupair (nanny) in Hackensack, New Jersey. Before I came there my English was decent. My vocabulary was not that large and my pronounciation sounded like the average Swede; pretty good comparing to other Europeans, but not excellent. Then I made the best descision I've ever made; to go abroad and work in America. In school back home in Sweden the English teacher talked pretty slowly with a clear British accent. If you didn't understand what she was saying you could always ask her and she explained it in Swedish. Standing in the kitchen in Hackensack, New Jersey trying to understand what my mumbling, Brooklyn born, host dad Fred was saying while he was doing the dishes, was somewhat harder. Many times I just said "yes" and prayed that he didn't ask me if I was doing drugs. But, as time passed by, I learned more and more to listen extra carefully when he was talking. At the end of my year I understood nearly everything he said. Thanks to him I've become a more attentive listener. I've always read a lot of books but I didn't start to read English books until I was 19 years old. In America I was so tired of speaking and hearing English all the time I found out that I really required a Swedish book or a magazine before I went to bed. I didn't want to read books in English too. I've noticed that it takes me twice as long time to read an English book than a Swedish one. The reason why is because I have to look up words and sometimes read paragraphs more than one time to really understand. When it comes to my speaking skills I've adopted an ugly American accent. I would rather speak Australian English which sounds more beautiful or British English which, in my opinion, sounds more proper. But any accent is better than a Swedish accent! y vocabulary has grown, especially with words that are related to babies and household. For example; bib, pacifier, cupboard and sink are words I didn't know before I came to America. I remember one time, in the beginning of my year, when my mumbling host dad asked me to give him a paper towel. Since I'd never heard of paper towels (only towels) and was a little bit shy, I gave him a towel from the bathroom. He started laughing and I stood there, looking like a questionmark, with a towel in my hand wondering what was so funny. Everytime he met someone he never had met before he told him or her about his Swedish aupair, who didn't know what a paper towel was. I don't have much problem writing. I like to write essays and I've written a few essays in English. Spelling has always been one of my strong sides, both in Swedish, German, Spanish and English. My grammar skills, though, are not what they should be. The grammar course is hopefully gonna change that. I really have to improve my grammar! In America I didn't write much. I only wrote shopping lists and a few letters to my foreign friends. Before I left for the USA I planned to take a writing course besides taking care of the children. I ended up taking a self defense course... So much for those plans! I really like the English language and I think that I'm doing pretty well using it. Nine years of learning English in school and spending one year in America should be a good basis for future Englishstudies. I plan to take the B-course in English here in Uppsala and after that, maybe go back to America, this time to study. One of the many reasons that I want to learn more about the English language is that someday I want to work abroad and maybe even live in the USA, Great Britain or Australia for a couple of years - or a lifetime!
EE209	1	﻿ Premature Children The question of life has long been a hot topic. The recent discovery that a foetus can be saved at the same week during the pregnancy when it is still legal to abort it has evoked the debate. In the article from Dagens Nyheter, January 30 2001, the paediatrician Hugo Lagercrantz argues that since there is a 50 percent risk that the premature child will get retardation, physicians in consultation with the parents should not try to save all premature children. Are there any causes that could affect a patient's value and the physician's obligation to give sufficient medical care? Lagercrantz seems to believe so, but I do not and in this essay I will present two arguments which proves this. Firstly the right of life and secondly the right of all human beings to obtain medical care. This is a topic that involves several different aspects such as whether the law of abortion should be changed, the question of euthanasia and the question of what is a worthy life. However, since this is a limited essay I will restrict myself to the two arguments mentioned above. Firstly, I believe that all human beings possess the same value and the same right to live, regardless of age. I believe that a person's human value and right to live does not correlate to his or her age. A seventy-year-old woman does not have a greater right to live than a baby born too early has. The premature child should therefore be judged according to the same principles as any other person, young or old. Strangely enough, as Lagercrantz seems to believe, premature children apparently do not have the same right to live as fully developed children have when there is a risk of getting a disease. However, according to present legislation, the foetus gains full value of protection when it is viable, that is when it outside the uterus, can accept the help modern medical care can provide, with a chance to grow into a human being. Therefore, the physicians must try to save the child. Moreover, I feel that we, ordinary people as well as physicians, do not obtain the right to rule over other people's lives. Life is a gift and is not something that we have power over. Secondly, Lagercrantz writes that there is a 50 percent risk of the premature child ending up with retardation and therefore states that the physicians should not try to save severely premature children when the risk of illness is so great. Yes, it is inevitable that a certain number of premature children will end up with retardation, however, as the physician Fredrik Serenius et al states in an article in Dagens Nyheter from February 18 2001; there is also a risk of retardation for fully developed children who have suffered from serious illnesses after their births. These children would never be denied the right of medical care, nor would adults with a severe disease, and of course, this should be the case for premature children as well. The main task of the physicians should be to provide best possible care and this care is not reserved for any particular person, but is a right of all human beings. Additionally, I believe that the paediatrician's attitude is important in order to save the premature child. As Serenius et al states, if the physician is quite sure that the child will end up with an illness, his attitude against the rescue will probably influence the staff in the delivery room which in the end could cause the child's death. In conclusion, I strongly object to Lagercrantz arguments of why the physicians should not try to save all premature children. As stated, my belief is that we all have the same value irrespective of age and therefore we also have the right to obtain equally good medical care. In addition, Sweden is a well-developed country within this field and has the resources to give retarded children and their families all possible help and care. I believe Lagercrantz's attitude to be élitist and fear that his ideas could lead to an even more segregated society in which people can reject retarded children, children which can give us another perspective on life.$$$﻿ The Increased Number of Young Offenders In recent years, the violence among adolescents has increased in the Swedish society. According to the National Statistics Office of Sweden, violence among people in the ages of 16 to 24 increased severely between the years 1978 and 1995. The biggest increase was found among young men. According to an article in Svenska Dagbladet, young people in the ages of 15 to 24, are today responsible for 38% of the crimes involving violence in Sweden. Due to this, a number of organisations such as the Non-Fighting Generation have emerged in order to put an end to this trend and help the adolescents involved. There exist many examples concerning the causes for the increased violence among adolescents in Sweden, and in this essay, I will present the three most credible causes and give a conclusion. Firstly, the debate whether or not violent television programmes influence children in a negative way has long been topical. Some argue that the child is not affected whereas others argue that children are impressionable and cannot separate fiction from reality. I have to agree with the latter. Many children grow up in insecure home environments where many lack a satisfactory role model to teach them to distinguish between right and wrong. One could argue that only small children are affected and that older children can understand that the television programmes are not real. I agree with this, however one must take another aspect into consideration. Violent programmes only show one way of solving problems and giving vent to aggressions. According to Lena Brostrom at the Police Department in Eskilstuna, the children who are involved in criminality in Sweden today often come from families where a satisfactory role model who should give an alternative to the television's way of solving problems does not exist. Consequently the child does not learn other ways of solving problems than to use violence. Secondly, the society we live in today is far more internationalised than it was several years ago. The internationalisation has led to the entry of weapons and drugs, and the fact that this is easier to get hold of, has caused the violence to involve younger people. It is a fact that young people more than before possess weapons, and according to Lena Brostrom, children up to the age of 17 mostly use knives whereas young people over the age of 17 have guns. Drugs, such as cigarettes and alcohol are used by children at the early age of 12 to 15 and are easy to get hold of and once you have tried, it is often an easy transition to use harder drugs which often leads one into criminality. Furthermore, our society has become segregated, mostly due to the great unemployment years and Sweden is no longer the same welfare state. Society has become divided with areas consisting of people of limited means, often with one parent households. These areas often have high criminality rates. In addition to the segregation, society is also becoming more competitive. For instance, it is essential to work hard in school in order to do well in society. According to Lena Brostrom, the children who have grown up in families where the parents have failed to be good role models, have difficulties to cope both in and outside school. They have lost their confidence in adults, often coming from home environments where one or both parents are drug abusers. If they fail in school they give up, feeling that it is no idea to struggle. Of course, many would argue that it is easy to get a new chance of succeeding in school since Sweden has a well organised system of adult education, but these children do not see any possibilities and feel that it is useless. Moreover, it is essential for the entire family to take part and since the families are often faltering, many fail to succeed. Thus, the children end up outside in society and need to find an alternative way to hold one's own and gain respect. For many, the answer is violence and crime. In conclusion, the society of today is hard on adolescents, and if they do not grow up in secure home environments, they easily get into trouble. In my opinion, it is essential for society to react at an early stage in order to stop this negative development. The social services are insufficient in this field and the resources are too limited. I believe that we have to start helping the children already in the school environment since it is often clear what children will get into trouble. We must also improve the help for faltering families in need. It would lay in everybody's interest to put an end to this trend. Firstly, in order to help our adolescents and secondly, to diminish the rehabilitation costs.
EE367	0	﻿An introduction: This is an essay about our strenghts and weaknesses in the english language and to my suprise the hardest part was NOT to write it but to find my strenghts and weaknesses. To find the weaknesses was not TOO dificult but the strenghts? Often it is easier to say what you are bad at than to say what you are good at. When I wrote this essay I decided to write in four undergroups to make it easier to read and understand(and write). They are: writing, listening, reading and talking. The art of writing: Of all parts in the english language this is the part that I find hardest. My strenght here is that I am good at finding the right word and a talent to describe a situation so well that you can almost touch it. Then why do I say that I find it hard? That is becourse I am REALLY bad at gramma so the words and sentenses are almost always wrong. Another problem is that when I write I get som caught up in what I am doing so I do not think about spelling and so on. The art of listening: It is hard to say if I am good or bad at listening. Of course I prefere to think that I am good at listening and I base that on my understanding of the speaker and that I do not have to stop and think about the meaning of every word. The art of reading: I do love to read and I prefere to read books that is not translated becourse in many cases they loose a lot in the translation. That means that I read most in english. I think that I am good at reading, I do it a lot and I can grasp a hole sentence without knowing exactly every word. The problem is that most of the time when I am reading I am so caught up in the story that I forget to look up every word I do not know. The art of speaking: Here is one of my stronger parts in the english language. As always I thing about myself as a good speaker, both in Sweden and in English. My strenght here is that I am not afraid of trying to speak english and I really do not care if exactly every word is right but instead that we understand eachother and that is is a good conversation. I speak fluently and often and I know a lot of words. y weakness is that I have a tendency to not think throught what i am going to say before I do it and therefor I can stumble over words or put them in the wrong order (I do that in swedish too). These are my strenghts and weaknesses in the english language(and in the other languages). Then what can I do to get better in my problem areas? I have to study grammar very hard and I have to learn to think things throught before I do things.$$$﻿This essay consists of four main subjects, or you could maybe say four different parts, namely the four different parts of which my English consists. They are, which if you think of it is quite obvious, writing, reading, speaking and listening listed in no particular order. I will begin whit some thoughts about the subject reading. Reading, well the first book I read the whole of in English was "The way to dusty death" of Alistar MacLean and I think I was about fifteen or sixteen years old wen I read it. Then it took a couple of years before I read the next book. It must have been when I was around eighteen or so and I realised that English fantasy novels, which were then and still are my favourite kind of novel, comes out one or two years earlier in English and to half the Swedish price. That because the books, when they are translated to Swedish, normally are divided into two parts. Both parts, in Swedish, are of course sold separately at the same price as you would had paid for the whole book in English. So the response to the Swedish book sellers greed can be only one, buy them and read them in English. There is of course also other facts that makes you buy them in English. The translations to Swedish are mostly not so good, you might even say that they stink and a book is nearly always better in the original language. That far about reading... I must say that it is a hard job for my fingers to find their way over the keyboard. This is, or will at least be when it is ready, by far the most extensive text, and I must admit that extensive is not a word that seems to be appropriate at all when you look at this text, that I have ever written in English. So when we already are touching the subject why not also say something about it. I must say that I am surprised that its not harder than it is. When I sat down before the computer and started on this essay I thought it would be a hard nut to crack but I think the words flow out on the paper quite easily. The spelling is not a problem since the computer corrects the worst faults, the wonders of modern technique, what is the problem is instead the grammar which probably will result in a lot of big read signs when I get this essay back. When I write in Swedish I can in most cases feel what is right and what is wrong, to be frank I can not my Swedish grammar either. The problem goes back to the senior levels of the upper form when I had an teacher in both English and Swedish which I disapproved of. As a matter of fact I then thought he was more interested in telling jokes about Norway then learning out English. Retrospectively I have to admit that neither English or Swedish were what you might call my favourite subjects in school. And that way it went on when I went to the gymnasium. Good grades in Swedish literature history and not so good in Swedish language. Best reader of English text by far in my class, among those on the second part on the list of exam results. Speaking and listening then? Well, as most Swedes of my generation born in the 70's and raised by the telly I understand nearly everything I hear on the news or in English speaking programs. It is easier to understand British English than American English, I have to concentrate more when I listen to American programs. An interesting thing is that I still have very difficult to take out the words when I listen to a song on the radio. Its like the words blend in whit the music and becomes a part of it, I just can't separate them. I haven't yet had any bigger problems listening to English native speaker when I talk whit them on the other hand I have not yet met so many of them so I can make a real statement in the question. Speaking then, of course my active vocabulary is smaller then my passive, goes whit out saying, but I can make my self understood not as good as want to but I manage. An interesting point thou is that it takes a little while before my active vocabulary starts working. It's like the mind needs a little while to readjust and start thinking and communicating in a new language. During the time I have written this paper I have noticed that it is the same thing whit writing in English. It is much easier to find the words now in the end of the paper than when I sat down and started. I think that I as usual have overstepped the limit for the essays size so I'll stop here since it seems to be a good place to stop at, besides I think I have done a quite fair evaluation of my knowledge in the English language.
EE492	0	﻿Since I have always been interested in different languages, especially English, I do not think I have ever thought of my listening skills as very weak. Further on, I believe that it is so much easier to understand by listening than it is to speak in a different language. As for myself, I know that I may not understand a certain word when it stands on its own, but given the full sentence I have no trouble understanding the meaning of it. Compared to other countries in Europe, people in Sweden and Holland have better skills in the English language. I think that this has to do with television, partly because we import a lot of American and English TV-shows and movies, but the main reason is that these productions are not dubbed but subtitled. Since I have been raised in a generation that watches a lot of television, I feel that my listening comprehension has grown more and more for every day that has past. Another thing that makes me listen a lot to English is the music, which is either imported from English spoken countries, or made abroad but in English though. This has also helped me a lot to understand a certain word in the whole context, whether I wanted it or not. I mean, I listen all the time even if it is about something I really do not find very interesting, and therefore I have automatically picked up a few words that I never thought I would learn. Though it is hard sometimes to read in a different language, I believe that it gives you more knowledge, not just in the language it is written in but also about real life in another part of the world. From my own experience I can say that it can be difficult to get into a book, it often takes a couple of pages and then it starts to get easier to understand the connection. A book is also often easier to read than a newspaper for example, because the newspaper is written is so many difficult words and with many technical terms. But I think that it is a very good exercise to read the newspapers if you want to improve your English reading ability, which I feel that I do. Today I think that my reading skills are quite good after all but it would not hurt to enlarge it though. An example to improve the reading skills could be to correspond with a person in English, which in fact helps improving ones writing skills as well. The weakness that comes to my mind about my own skills in reading is that I find it a bit tough having to look up a lot of words that I do not understand in the context. A strength that I possess is that I find it exciting to learn how many ways there are of expressing yourself, to explore the meaning of different words and to add them to my own vocabulary. Speaking is more than just put the words in the right order, you have got to make it right grammatically as well. This is one of the things I find pretty difficult sometimes, because I realize it is easier to write grammatically correct since you have got more time to think it over then. When speaking I sometimes feel that I stumble over the words, and I wish I could correct them by rubbing it out as if it was printed on a paper. Maybe it has got to do with insecurity, that I do not think I have enough skills in speaking. I do need to work more on my vocabulary, I believe. Although I believe that I am not so extremely terrible in speaking English but now and then it just do not come out the way I had wanted it to from the beginning. Writing is a lot easier than it is to speak as I have written above. I think that it is an advantage that I enjoy writing because it gives me an opportunity to train myself in grammar and to extend my vocabulary. For me, this is a good way of focusing on the grammar part and that is something I really need for my own good. So, this course will hopefully help me to understand grammar in both English and Swedish better.$$$﻿Like every schoolchild in Sweden I started studying English in primary school and continued all the way trough secondary and upper secondary school. I have had time both to hate it and to love it. By the time I graduated from upper secondary school I was rather content with my knowledge of English, but in 1997 I was put to the test. y friend Jenny and I went to Scotland to work for the summer. We were employed as chambermaids in a hotel in Fort William. There were many foreign employees there, but most of them came from other English-speaking countries, Canada, New Zealand, Australia etc. The time in Scotland made me see things about my English that weren't as obvious before considering listening, reading, speaking and writing. In this essay I will reflect on my discoveries about my skills and weaknesses in English. Listening I have never considered listening to English very hard. If there has been a word I don't understand I usually can derive it to some other language, or guess by the context. That was until that first day in Scotland when I met my employer Paul and the housewife Morag. The Scottish I had heard so far had been nothing compared to theirs. Luckily Jenny understood a bit more so I tried to do as she did, and not to look as stupid as I felt. That summer I learned that listening to English is not hard unless it is when I'm tired, or spoken with a strong regional accent. The first week I dreamed about words and phrases I had heard during the day, that was perhaps my way of process my learning. I worked in pairs with a girl from New Zealand, Cheryl (probably the most talkative person in the entire staff), and the first few days I mostly listened to her, but slowly I started getting used to my duties and could start to concentrate on speaking myself. Speaking Speaking I have always considered to be my strong side, I think it's fun and I'm not afraid to try. After a couple of days with Cheryl I even started to joke and use expressions and slang that I had heard the others say. The problem is that usually people doesn't say anything when I'm wrong, so I don't learn as much as I want to. I noticed that first week that my tongue gets tired after speaking a foreign language for a day, and I start to slur my words. Sometimes I even slur on purpose because I don't know exactly the right word or pronunciation, in some vague hope that people will interpret it into the right word. The greatest problem of speaking is the cultural and social differences, I make so many mistakes without even being aware of it. That is an area I'm eager to learn more about. Reading Every Saturday in Scotland Jenny and I, as soon as we had got our wages, went to the bookstore and bought a new book that we read and then swapped with each other. When I find a good book I devour it, and that is one of my strong sides in reading English, I don't look up words but try to understand by the context. Of course that could be a bad thing too since I don't learn some of the words and some of the meaning is lost to me. y weakness in reading is more formal English, like instructions with many technical terms or tax-forms. It felt like a kind of rehabilitation tough, when some of the English-speaking people I worked with didn't understand how to fill in the tax-forms either. Writing Altogether I think writing is my weakness in English. I'm not good at grammar, not at formal English, and uncertain of the expressions I've picked up from somewhere. Sometimes it feels like I'm a completely different person when I write instead of speak. It was very frustrating when I got home from Scotland and tried to write my new friends, suddenly it felt as I was seven years old and not at all the same funny, casual Karin they had got to know. Perhaps I have got a bit better at it by continuing to write to them and to read their letters to me, but writing is the area I especially would like to improve. I am looking forward to learning more English this term and to improve my weaknesses. I know it will be hard work, but I want to read this essay and find it is no longer true.
EE363	1	﻿"The world knows and feels the existing evil; it will look at the new order of things proposed-approve-will the change-and it is done" Robert Owen wrote promoting his ideas for co-operative villages, his second social project. Owen was an idealistic man with many ideas of how to improve the world. He realized some of these, some sucessfully, others less so. In this essay I will compare two of his social projects and their underlying ideas: the factory reforms in New Lanark, Scotland, and the co-operative village of New Harmony, Indiana. In the beginning of the 19th century when Robert Owen became the manager of the mills of New Lanark, Scotland, he was struck by the poor condidtion in which his employees worked and lived. Of the 2000 employees 500 were children, brought from the poor houses in Scotland. In the town of New Lanark immorality, fornication, drunkenness and crimes were part of the everyday life. As Owen believed that man's character was formed for him by the environment in which he was raised and lived, he was neither surprised at the state of the town, nor did he blame the employees for their behavior. He saw the problems in the town as collective, not individual. He believed that the people could be changed by changes of the environment, and that this would not only benefit the people themselves, but also the factory, the mill. He compared the workers to the new machines: "If, then, due care as to the state of your inanimate machines can produce such beneficial results, what may not be expected if you devote equal attention to your vital machines, which are far more wonderfully constructed?" (Owen quoted by Arthur Bestor). By improving the conditions in New Lanark Owen hoped to improve the character of his employees. He provided the people with better houses and clothing, he opened a shop where products of good quality could be bought at very low prices. He encouraged the people to be clean and orderly and had the sale of alcohol restricted. Most importantly, however, he provided education for the children, the "Institution Established for the Formation of Character" (Arthur Bestor) as he called it. He also founded the first infant school. These changes had a remarkable effect on the town; there were now very little drunkenness and idleness, the people were clean and much healthier than before. The children were: "...generally felt to be graceful, genial, and unconstrained; health, plenty and relative contentment prevailed" (Encyclopedia Britannica). The project was a great success. Encouraged by the success in New Lanark Owen wanted to apply his theories in a wider scale. Turning his attention from factory reform to social reform, he formulated the idea of co-operative villages where the people would share everything and live in abundance, hapiness and harmony. These villages would have the right environment for creating the perfect man: "He will be trained from earliest infancy to acquire only kind and benevolent dispositions" (Owen quoted by Robert S. Fogarty). The villages would consist of 1000 to 2000 people living in a square at the centre of the land with shared facilities for education, health care, dining and amusements. Everyone would take turns at the different work tasks in the village. There would be such abundance no personal proprerty or possessions would be needed, there would be plenty for all. Owen was convinced that if he could create one of these villages, it would be so successful everyone in the world would want to live in one, and these villages would gradually replace all other towns and cities. He wrote that: "... the only real practical difficulty will be to restrain men from rushing too precipitately from one to the other" (Arthur Bestor). To realize this vision Owen bought a village which he renamed New Harmony, in Indiana, USA. Owen invited anyone who wanted to live the new society to come to New Harmony, and soon 800 people inhabited the co-operative village. The practical arrangements worked at first; food, clothes and medicines were free of charge, the children were educated and there were plenty of amusements for the people. However, things did not go according to Owen's plans: Everything was payed for by Owen himself, and not by the produce of the co-operative village, which seemed to be insufficient. Many of the people who had come to New Harmony were just fleeing poverty, and not very interested in the co-operative spirit. Soon, disagreements concerning the form of the village government occured, there were divisions among the inhabitants and different societies were formed. There were arguments about the disposal of property and eventually, after three years, the co-operative fell apart. Everything went back to the traditional way of life and Owen sold out individual property to the inhabitants in an attempt to cut his losses. The co-operative village was a complete faliure. There were many reasons why Owen's project in New Harmony was not a success like the one in New Lanark. One was his contempt for the knowledge of his forerunners, for all intellectuals and social theorists and consequently, he had no political philosophy or knowledge and therefore no means of solving the political conflicts in New Harmony. He simply believed that in the new society, the co-operative villages, man would be so happy there would be no disagreements, and no political problems. This had not been a problem at New Lanark, he was the manager and the employees did as he told them. Another reason was that of the people who came to New Harmony, few shared Owen's ideals. The village of New Harmony was dependent upon a co-operative spirit among the inhabitants but there was none. Consequently, the village was not self sufficient, and constantly needed more money, which came from Owen's own pockets. In New Lanark, the people were employed by Owen and could not afford to be idle. By improving their living and working conditions a higher moral and better work performance was accomplished without relying on their philosophical ideals. In conclusion, Robert Owen was a great success as a factory reformer at New Lanark, but less so as a social reformer at New Harmony. His belief that man is formed by and can be changed by his environment was proved true. His ideas of co-operating villages however, were too vague to be successful in creating a new society.$$$﻿ Young, beautiful and successful: The superficial portrayal of women in the media Western society is becoming more and more superficial. People, women especially, are more often judged by their physical appearance than by who they are. This affects women in many ways, none of which is positive. I believe the media, in their often stereotypical picturing of women, could be blamed for having a great part in this. Therefore I think the media should change their approach to how they show women. In this essay I will discuss how women are portrayed, which message this gives and the effects of it. The potrayal of women in the media does not very much correspond to reality. The female characters in films and TV series, as well as the models shown in magazines, send out a distorted picture of the perfect woman. These people are supposed to be good role models, but the only characteristics they have in common are that they are all very skinny and very good-looking. Other qualities, such as intelligence, strength of character or kindness, do not seem as important. In the magazines the beautiful faces are accompanied by headlines about how to lose weight with the new diet, or how to make yourself more desireable with the latest fashion and make-up. It is very seldom that a plump girl or a mature woman, with wrinkles, are seen on the covers of these magazines. To make things worse, the pictures are retouched to make the models even more beautiful. Flaws, like wrinkles, moles or anything unwanted, are easily removed to make the perfect picture. If the top models are not good enough the way they are, how are the rest of us supposed to be? This message, of the importance of beauty, is very disturbing. By constantly giving advice on how to lose weight, what make-up to use or which exercises to do to get "the perfect body", the magazines are more or less saying: You are not good enough, you are not thin enough and you are not beautiful enough. Why this focus on looks? Why is it so important to be attractive? Women tend to say it is for their own sake, because it makes them feel good, and they probably believe this to be true. But the underlying reason why is because they think that is how the men want them. It is what the media tell them every day. I do recognize that there are a few newspapers, magazines and TV shows that have a better approach, but this is not nearly enough. The majority of the media still need to change their attitude towards women, because what they tell us today is that a woman needs be thin and beautiful. Only then can she find a man and be socially accepted, happy and successful. This distorted picture of women are having severe effects, especially among young and insecure girls. Not realizing that what they are pesented with are products, manufactured by the media, and not real people, they think they are expected to look like the models and the actresses. Not too long ago a junior school in Stockholm had to impose a ban on cosmetics; the seven-year-old girls kept turning up late for class, as they "had to" put on their make-up. Another already common problem is young girls going on diets, and starving themselves. Sadly enough illnesses like anorexia and bulimia are becoming more frequent, and are affecting younger and younger children. Older teenagers and women are also influenced, spending thousands of pounds on cosmetical surgery; breast enlargements, liposuction and facelifts. However, these operations seldom make very much difference on what is important: The feeling of not being good enough, which probably caused the desire to change the appearance, will still be there. I believe if the media showed a more diverse and less superficial picture of women, these problems would not be as common. As the media have have so much influence on society, they also have a moral responsibility towards it. In presenting a stereotypical and superficial image of women, the media are giving the message that the physical appearance is what is important. This generates a feeling of inadequacy among many girls and women and creates many problems for them. The media can, and therefore should, change this by taking a different approach to how they portray women.
EE200	1	﻿ David and Harriet want to create a perfect and happy family. In their future they see many children and a harmonic and happy family life. In this future there is no room for anyone or anything that is different. The main theme as I see it is: in the society and family David and Harriet live in, and in the family they want to create, anyone or anything which is different has no place. David and Harriet are different according to their family and closest friends, when they want to have a big family, and Ben, the fifth child, is different from everything everyone else ever has seen. The family represents the society in this novel and this is the most important setting. When David and Harriet decide that they want to have many children, the resistance from their families and friends is enormous. And there are other occasions when the relations think that they are strange. When Dorothy, Harriet's mother, says that the children always could sleep in the same room, David says that it is important that they have a room of their own, the book says: "The family exchanged glances as families do when stubbing toes on some snag in one of them..." 1. During Harriet's pregnancy with Ben, she is acting in a way that the rest of the family is not used to. Not even the doctor understands, or wants to understand, that something is wrong. When Ben is born he is certainly not like the other children. The relations that visit do not want anything to do with this child who is so different and unpleasant, "...it was painful to see how their faces changed confronting this phenomenon. Ben was always quickly handed back." 2. David and Harriet can not realise that he is their son. He has no place in their happy, perfect family. Ben is only accepted by those who are a bit unaccepted themselves by society. John the boy who starts to help the family in the garden is unemployed and does not want to do anything except spending time with his friends. He is the first one Ben shows any affection for. John accepts Ben and among John's friends he has a place, even though it is just like some sort of a pet. But it is not just Ben that is different. When Harriet's sister's child, Amy, is born her parents want to hide her from the rest of the family because she has Down's syndrome, "...the poor baby was in Sarah's arms, covered up so as not to upset everyone..." 3. This I also see, as an example of the family's difficulty to accept anyone who is different The time when the story takes place is also important for the theme. The novel takes place between the middle of the 1960s and the middle of the 1980s in a little town in England outside London, a time when it not seems easy to be different. This is exemplified when David and Harriet are thinking about their happy family just before Paul is born: "It had been hard preserving their belief in themselves when the spirit of the times, the greedy and selfish sixties, had been so ready to condemn them, to isolate, to diminish their best selves." 4 Their beliefs and wishes are not common in the time and the society the story describes, but David and Harriet stand for what they believe in. Ben is put in an institution but he is not the only child there. I interpret it, as there was more than one pair of parents who wanted to hide their children if they were not normal. It also seems like everyone is afraid of the different. None of the doctors who examine Ben wants to admit that he is not a normal child. Another example of the society's fear for things that are not normal is when Paul, the second youngest boy is going to a psychiatrist: "Paul was sent to 'talk to someone' as the phrase goes." 5 To talk to a psychiatrist is to be different and no one wants to be that. Another part of the setting, which supports the theme, is the social setting. David's mother's family is academic and his father's family has a lot of money. The money from David's father makes David's and Harriet's dream practicable and it is also these money that makes it possible to send Ben to the institution where he is supposed to die. This could not be possible in a family, which had not got the money to send him away. And it is more difficult to be different in a surrounding where the demands on a person to be perfect are high, which I think they perhaps are in better educated and rich environments. It can be difficult to preserve our own ideas and believes in a society where we are expected to live up to certain standards or act in a certain way. This is something David and Harriet realises when they start to implement their dreams. This novel takes place in a time where it seems difficult not to follow the pattern and be like everyone else. 1 Lessing, Flamingo 1993, page 31 2 Lessing, Flamingo 1993, page 68 3 Lessing, Flamingo 1993, page 32 4 Lessing, Flamingo 1993, page 29 5 Lessing, Flamingo 1993, page 131$$$﻿ In an article by Ginia Bellafonte, Locking out violence, an antiviolence chip is discussed. This chip is supposed to protect children from watching TV programmes that are violent. But not even programmes that are intended for children are totally free from violence. What I am aiming at is animated films, which sometimes can contain very much violence. In animated films a character can be run over by a train and become totally flat, but in the next sequence the character is running around as usual again. Can children realise that this is fiction, and can they distinguish the reality from this fiction? And why do films that mostly are intended for children have to contain any violence at all? These are questions that I am going to discuss in this essay. Can children make a distinction between fiction and reality? Can they actually realise that a lot of what happens in cartoons could not happen in real life? Well most children probably realise that some things can not happen in real life. But if they can make that distinction there and then when they are looking, what implies that they always can make that distinction. When they are playing with their friends they are creating their own fiction world. And if they have seen in cartoons, which is fiction too, that the characters for example throw stones at each other; then maybe the children throw stones at each other in the fiction world they are creating when they are playing. I have actually experienced a five-year-old boy jumping from the highest place on wall bars in a gymnasium, pretending he was Darkwing Duck. This little boy ended up with a concussion and perhaps a somewhat clearer picture of what is possible in real life. When this cartoon was broadcast in Sweden it was highly debated. The programme was considered to be very violent. This programme was eventually stopped because the opposition from the parents was too high. Perhaps most children can make a distinction between real life and fiction, but sometimes the boarder between fiction and real life can be a little bit unclear. I do not think that children should be left alone in front of the TV when they are looking at these kind of programmes. Children need an adult to talk to, someone who can help them distinguish what could happen in real life and what is just fiction. Is it actually necessary with all this violence in animated films? There are very few cartoons that do not contain any violence at all, not even My little Pony, which is considered to be a cute girls film, is totally free from violence. In Tom & Jerry, which is considered to be one of the most violent cartoons, the whole story is based upon the fighting between the cat and the mouse, and them hurting each other. Is this what children want to see, or is it the filmmakers who want them to like this? I think children should be more involved in the movie-making process. Not as it mostly is today, adults who try to figure out what children like. If children sometimes were asked what they wanted to see, then it perhaps would not be so much violence in animated films. I know that I did not like the cartoons that contained too much violence when I was a child. I think filmmakers use violence to cover up a bad story. This is a method that is used in films for adults but I do not think it should be used in films for children. Animated films are mostly seen by children. This should be a reason to make them less violent. I do not think that children can distinguish completely between fiction and real life, and if violence is allowed in these films it can be difficult for parents to justify to their children that they are not allowed to use violence. It is easy for us as adults to say that what happens in animated films could not happen in real life, but for children the boarder between fiction and real life is not as distinguished as it is for us.
EE203	0	﻿I have always had natural skills in learning languages although I have never put much work in it. I have always been interested in languages because there are so many different ways to use it. Almost every word has different meanings depending on in which context they are used. You can simply put it that I am fascinated by languages with their possibilities. When it comes to my English skills, right now it lacks because of not using it very often in a long time. It has gone ten years since I last studied English and then I lacked in motivation. Rules and grammar never reached me, I learned the long, hard way instead. Which means that I learned every phrase and word and so on separately, without putting them away with similar things. Although a lot of things feels natural when said, I always feel insecure when it comes to the use of pronouns, to give an example. y listening skills I find good. I don't find it a problem to understand what others are trying to say to me. You don't have to understand every, specific word, you can reach understanding by getting the context. We are always exposed to the English language through television and music and that is a great help to our listening skills. y reading abilities are also good. I haven't read that much English books/texts but it is the same as with the above-mentioned speech about words and context. You can fill in the blanks by understanding the context. I recently found out that I have got it easier to read loud for myself than reading loud in front of others. At the same time I noticed that I found it easier if I read it with an accent of some kind. Which leads us directly to the art of speaking. Like many, although many won't write it, it's so easy to speak English while being drunk. You tend to loosen up and it runs quite fluently. In my case it has to do with self-confidence. I feel a bit afraid of making myself ridiculous, and by being afraid it often becomes a ridiculous. It has to do with first thinking in Swedish what I want to say, and then saying it in English. Often if I can't find the words I talk in a round-about way, but it will surely be bettered during this five months, as well as the other skills. A problem due to the lack of words is of course to get into deeper, intellectual discussions in various matters. One of the goals which I have for this semester is to get rid of the "Queen Victoria-style" of English which was hammered in through my schooltime. When I was in Ireland for a holiday they wondered if I was trying to be someone special. Of course I weren't, but I think it says it all. In all I think I am good in pronounciating words and I think I am quite good in talking. But as I have already mentioned, when I learn my grammar better I will also be a better talker. When it comes to judging my writing skills it's hard to say something because it's the way in which I am expressing myself at this time. I can express one of my assets, while you right now is reading these sentences, shaking your head. But I'll try anyway. As I have always been interested in words and languages it have also affected my writing. I have always loved to play with words, trying to express myself differently. When I was younger I used to write poetry, often in English. But that is an other way of using the written language. At that time I tried to say as much as I could with as few words as possible, putting big meanings into every word. As a singer in a band I deal with the lyrics in the same way, short sentences with a big meaning.. I think I am a good writer, especially in Swedish, but hopefully in English as well. You have to know this text is improvised, no checking of the grammar, no looking in the dictionary, instead seeking after what feels right. The meaning with this assignment I hope is to get aware of what faults I make, and it will surely be seen in these pages, and then I will have a possibility to improve. And to cut a long story shorter I will end it now.$$$﻿This essay will deal with my strength and weakness in English in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing, in my view of that matter. I was nine years old when I began to study English, which was one year before the intermediate level of the nine-year compulsory school. This first year was more of a preparation to the following ten years, up to high school. In the senior level of the nine-year school I went to a boarding school for a month in the summer. This was good for my speaking. I've never been strong in English, but I didn't really realise this until in high school. In a desperate attempt to improve my skills I took an excellent summer languages course in Cambridge for four weeks. After high school my contact with English has been moor in a passive manner, that is reading English textbooks, having lectures in English and now and then communicating in English both for fun and because of studies. (I have been studying for five and a half-year at the Agricultural University). With this background I should be rather good at English, but I'm sorry to tell that I don't get the feeling that I am. There are a lot of things to be improved, but you shall always begin with the good things, and therefore I'll start with the listening bit. I believe that my comprehension of listening to English is quit well, although I know that there are words that I don't know. It's often possible to figure them out in some way according to the subject or you may have the opportunity to ask someone. Pity enough I'm often too lazy to write difficult words down and afterwards look them up in a dictionary. Many people learn English when watching the television, but I'm sorry to say that I am one of those who always read the subtitles and hardly ever use my ears. y listening goes hand in hand with my reading, I figure. I don't have a problem with reading English books. I understand English texts fairly well if it's an ordinary text and not a special technical one with a lot of technical terms. Instruction manuals can be little tricky. Although I mostly understand the text, I don't think that I can do a very good translation into Swedish as a translator. With reading I am a bit more ambitious in looking up words, but I suppose that it would be better if I also learnt them by heart, which I hardly do. I don't read many books in my spare time, but I don't avoid a book if it's written in English. Speaking is another chapter. To know a word passively is easier than to know it actively, that is to use it all by yourself. I'm not very shy person and therefor I've been speaking a bit, also thanks to the language courses I've attended. My pronunciation and grammar are not always correct, but at least I think that people understand what I am trying to say (or they are very polite not to ask me what I mean). Pleasure speaking is of course more easy than giving a speech or anything like that, but then you often get the opportunity to make preparations. There are times that I do not find the word that I am seeking for, the appropriate word, but often I find another instead, almost as good. The way I speak is reflected in my writing. You shan't write as you speak, but so I do, even if I try not to. My writing is bad in total I would think. The way I make sentences and my usage of words is a bit too Swedish. In writing I have the opportunity to look words up, to do grammar checking, but you don't look a thing up if you don't know that you're wrong. I think it's difficult to know when I'm wrong, and therefore I have this bad spelling, bad grammar. Over all I think that I can manage with my English today, but it's all about this making impressions on people. I don't want people to think that I'm nonchalant, not caring about their languages or their culture. Therefore I make this attempt to improve my skills further more in the English languages and try to take this course.
EE202	1	﻿ Conflict as entertainment At almost any time of day if you turn on the TV you can be rather sure to, at least on one of the channels, encounter a "real- life-show". These are shows where people have been put together in a confined space such as a locked apartment or a small deserted island and then are followed 24 hours a day by the cameras. We have gotten used to watching people turning them selves inside out in front of the camera, letting the viewers in on the most intimate details of their lives. But first and foremost we have gotten used to watching people argue on these shows. For the curious thing is that these shows evolve entirely around conflict- that is the whole concept behind them. In the book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" Neil Postman analyses how television influences public discourse. He presents the idea that television is extremely influential when it comes to directing our way of thinking and the way we interact. If Postman's conclusion is correct then these seemingly innocent shows suddenly become more frightening. It is easy to see that watching a group of people locked up in an apartment, who are all getting along just fine being supportive and respectful of one another would be dreadfully boring. In order to make these kinds of shows somewhat more "watch-worthy" you need to add some conflict. A "Real-life-show" without gossip, screaming and, if we're lucky, an occasional fist-fight is hardly worthy of the name. This is a fact well known by the producers of the shows. When casting for them they make sure to get people who don't seem to have much in common. Not because the participants then will complement each other and perhaps even learn something from one another but because they foresee conflict and that is what will sell the show. If the participants despite their differences would get along fine another element has been added to guarantee conflict. In almost all of these shows the participants have to vote for someone to leave the show. There are always people who don't measure up and accordingly have to leave the group. If you don't contribute to the collecting of food on a deserted island or fail to run a bar in a satisfactory way, you are being of no help to the group and you will have to pack your bags and leave. Yet another ingredient these shows simply cannot be without is gossip. Already a few hours after the participants have entered the house, bar, island or wherever it is they are being filmed, the gossip and the dividing up into different fractions have started. It is all about finding the right allies, who may change from day to day, and criticizing people behind their backs. The participants gossip wildly about each other and can, and most certainly will, say the most offensive things about one another because they will never be held responsible for anything they say. If any of the participants were to refuse to take part in this sort of un-constructive criticism of others or refuse to choose side, he or she would be sure to be the next one to leave the show. If Neil Postman is right in his assumption that television is such a powerful medium that it has the power to influence the way we see the World, then the "Real-life-shows" go from being merely a rather harmless and trivial form of entertainment to being much more influential and dangerous for the way we perceive "reality". Just think about the name "Real-life-shows". If this is what is being presented as reality then this is what we are going to expect reality to be like. If Postman is right these shows teach us to see the World in black and white, conflicts will be about who screams the loudest and we will learn that people who don't measure up to certain standards should be left behind. Let us just hope that Neil Postman is mistaken when it comes to the influence television has on our way of understanding the World. Because if he, God forbid, is right these shows point towards a rather gloomy future.$$$﻿ An idea on how to bring social justice to the school curriculum In a time when racism is growing amongst young people and words such as social Justice seems erased from our vocabulary it is of great importance to look at what role the school plays in the discussion and creation of attitudes. I believe the schools can and should play a more active part in bringing back social Justice on the agenda. What I am proposing is therefore the introduction during the last year of junior high school of a compulsory stay in a foreign country. I suggest that all Swedish high school students spend approximately one semester in a foreign country preferably outside of Western Europe, taking part in social projects such as building schools, helping with irrigation projects, working with the homeless or in women shelters etc. I suggest this project be funded with tax money. This idea might at first seem overly radical and somewhat unrealistic. But I will here argue that the tax money spent on this project will pay back greatly maybe not so much in economical terms but in terms of gains for both the individual as well as for the society at large. With the risk of sounding as a hopelessly outdated idealist I will not start with the economical gains (if there indeed are any) or the gains for the society but with how the individual student would benefit from this proposal. The first individual gain that come to mind is the students own personal growth. What better way to learn about yourself, learn responsibility and improve your self confidence than to travel and meet people from other cultures? I believe it is the schools ambition not only to teach the students facts but also other skills such as being able to take initiatives and ability to work in a group. This is an area where, judging from the present school debate, schools seem to have difficulties and are in need of new ideas. I believe a compulsory semester spent abroad is an innovating idea worth trying. Apart from being exposed to a different culture the students would also be exposed to a different language. Today when a lot of stress is being put on language skills in order to get a job, I see it as a good investment both for the individual and for the society at large to early on learn high school students to communicate in a second language. Therefore I think it is essential to make sure everybody gets this opportunity. I will now move on to look at what positive effects this suggested proposal would have on society. One of the major gains that come to mind is that it would help in the fight against racism. This is of course only a speculation from my side but I see it as a rather logic result if people at an early age were to be confronted with other cultures and social situations. Not only do I think it would be an efficient way to meet the growing racism but it would hopefully also raise the awareness of the importance of social Justice. I am by no means suggesting this to be the only solution but I do think it to be one way of dealing with two substantial problems our society is struggling with today; racism and a lack of interest in global social Justice. Looking beyond our own country it would also be beneficial for the receiving country, taken that the students would not merely be spectators but would actively be taking part in the different projects. Since everything today in order to be trustworthy has to be measured in economic terms I will venture to speculate that this idea is not only good for the individual and for society at large but can also be economically sustainable. As good as every day we read about the scarcity of qualified teachers, the physical decay of our school buildings and the lack of updated schoolbooks. With a large number of students (everyone in their final semester of junior high school) abroad every year the demand for schoolbooks and teachers would decrease. There would of course still be a need for some teachers to keep in contact with the students while abroad and to follow up at home coming. But the actual number of teachers could be reduced. It is also my conviction that this last "abroad spent" semester would be a good incentive for students to finish junior high school and therefore the number of dropouts would be reduced. Which apart from being good for the individual students also would have a good effect on the economy since more people would complete their studies and be more attractive on the job market. As you have seen I believe there to be many good reasons, both for society and for the students to introduce a compulsory stay abroad for the students in junior high school. I have even suggested in what way this could have a beneficial effect on the economy, even though my lack of economic training makes these assumptions rather speculative. But I believe that even if we, in order to implement this idea, would have to increase the taxes both the society, the school and the students have enough to gain that it would be well worth it.
EE584	0	﻿ The distribution revolution A burning issue in the world of music distribution today is the existence and usage of the computer program Napster. With the help of this program it is possible to share music files with other users of the program. The company behind Napster provides a database in which the users can search for what they want to download. The download itself is preformed only between two ordinary computers connected to the Internet. As the music is shared between private computers it's hard to control if the copyright of the music is violated. This is where the record companies come in. They don't like the fact that their music is freely available on the Internet without their control. To protect their interests several record companies has filed a lawsuit against Napster in order to get the service stopped. It has not been stopped yet but Napster is probably going to get stopped in the near future. I don't think the record companies are doing exactly the right thing. I think that record companies should collaborate with Napster and use their technology as a new way to distribute music. y main argument for that the record companies should use this new technology is that it's impossible to stop this development with music sharing on the Internet. The Napster community has today about 51 million registered users and if it's suddenly stopped it will result in a huge demand for something to replace it. Programs with almost the same functionality as Napster already exist and it probably wouldn't take long before Napster would be fully replaced. Because of the reason that I just mentioned it's better to cooperate with Napster than just to stop it. I'm not saying that the illegal copying of copyright protected music is going to end but this is a very good opportunity for the music industry to reduce it and at the same time make profit form it. As Napster is such a widely spread program it makes it a good foundation for use as a new distribution channel. Napster would naturally have to be transformed into a membership-based community where the members either pays a membership fee or pay for the music that they download. Another side of the issue is the users, which I haven't mentioned yet. They will be forced to pay for something that previously has been free of charge. Naturally quite a lot of the users will stop using the service, but the ones who are willing to pay will see that it's not only a bad thing that they have to pay. If the users are forced to pay I think it's the record companies responsibility to make all their music available on the service. Then the users would have a much bigger selection of music that always would be available for download. In addition to that the sound quality of the music would be better as the only one who would publish music on the service would be the record companies which has access to better equipment than an ordinary home user. The scenario that I have pictured is actually beginning to happen. The big German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, of which a main part is the big BMG record company, has signed an agreement with Napster. This agreement is aiming towards a membership based community just as the one I have been discussing, but how this is going to be designed has not yet been decided. If this agreement becomes a success then Bertelsmann will drop the lawsuit that they currently have against Napster. I hope that all the other record companies will follow Bertelsmann's example and join them and Napster to create a community where all music is available for download. This would in the beginning only be a complement to how music is distributed today, but I believe that it's one step forward towards a different way to distribute music in the future.$$$﻿y favourite subject in school has always been English and I think that you can learn a lot of English during school, especially if you're interested in it. Partly because of my interest in English I went to London to work as an au-pair for half a year after I had graduated from high-school. This was in many ways a very useful experience. I have as I said, always enjoyed the English language but there are always things that you can improve and I think I learned a lot from my stay in London. Still, there are things I feel better at and things I'm worse at. When it comes to reading, writing, listening and speaking English I sure have weaknesses in all of these skills, but also strengths. Because of my stay in London I'm quite used to listening to English. After all, it is kind of hard avoiding it when you are living in an English speaking country. You talk to people, watch television, in fact you're surrounded by the language all the time. After a while you even begin to dream in English! I feel that there is no problem when it comes to listening to and understanding English. Not only have I practised it in London as well as in school, but the English language is everywhere also in Sweden. We watch a lot of English television programs, listen a lot to English music and so forth. Though I have to admit that I can find it really hard to understand people who talk Scottish or Irish. Especially if their accent is very distinct and if they are talking fast. Last year I studied Psychology here in Uppsala. All the literature was in English and it was hard in the beginning but after a while I got in to it and now it feels natural. The good thing about reading is that if you don't know what a specific word means, the context can help you understand it or otherwise you can always look it up in a dictionary. Things are always easier and more enjoyable if you're interseted in it and I have always enjoyed reading. When I was younger I lived in a very small village far away from my friends so you can say that books were my best-friends. It may sound horrible but I didn't suffer from it. I find it no problem reading English novels but nonfiction which sometimes consists of very technical language can be difficult to understand. If there are a lot of hard words it takes a long time to read the text and it's easy to become frustrated. Assessing my own abilities when it comes to speaking English I find rather difficult. You're usually not aware of the mistakes you're making when speaking. When I went to England I thought I was rather good at English, but I soon realised that I had so much to learn. A lot of people said I was very good at speaking English, as they say to most Swedish people but children are honest and the children I was taking care of pointed out all the mistakes I made when talking and there were a few... My problems consisted mainly of pronunciation mistakes I hadn't thought of before like the difference between how you say niece and knees. I think I have required a fairly good British accent now, but I know that there are many things still to learn. Things I have noticed now during our pronunciation classes for example. The thing about speaking English though, is that it is such tremendous fun! I prefer British English and love the sound of it. It's a beautiful language and there are so many good expressions in English that you can't find in Swedish. Writing is the one part of the English language I feel least experienced in. I have a pen-friend in Canada since eight years back so I'm used to expressing myself in English but I'm not at all used to writing essays and reports. Of course we did some writing during English classes in school, but not a lot. I have however always written a lot in Swedish so at least I'm not all that unfamiliar with the concept of writing. However I feel that these writing classes will be a good complement to my English knowledge and I'm looking forward to it. In fact I think the whole term will be useful learning, otherwise I wouldn't be here!
EE530	0	﻿ CHANGE THE AGE LIMIT FOR BUYING ALCOHOL Have you ever thought about, just like I have, why we in Sweden have the odd legislation that people are allowed to buy alcohol in a bar the day they are 18 years old but they have to wait until they are 20 to go to "Systembolaget"? it is very difficult for me to see the reasons why there should not be a change in the law in order to let people from the age of 18 buy alcohol at "Systembolaget". To obtain alcohol is not a problem when you are 18 years old. Almost everyone knows someone who is 20 and, even though it is unlawful to peddle liquor, it is not seen as a big crime if the one you peddle to is over the age of 18. Many of my friends had parents who acted like peddlers after the day their sons and daughters were 18 years old, some of them even before that. The parents did this because they in this way thought they had control over how much their children drank. I also think they tried to tell their children that they trusted them and show them that they, in the eyes of the parents, had came a piece of the way to the life as an adult. Another reason for parents buying alcohol to their children is the fear of illicitly distilled liquor. This is another motive for me to say that the age limit for buying alcohol at "Systembolaget" should be lowered. It is easy to get hold of home distilled liquor and if the youths can not obtain alcohol from "Systembolaget", which most of them prefer even though it is more expensive, they turn to the dangerous illicitly distilled liquor. I return to what I mentioned in the beginning of the essay; that people in the ages between 18 and 20 are permitted to go to a bar and have a drink, but are not allowed to go to the state liquor shop to buy a few beers. I think the main reason to why we have not already got a change in the law is the fear that youths will easier be able to obtain alcohol if the age limit would be lower. This might be true, to get alcohol is already quite easy for many youths. Nevertheless, I do not think a change in the law would make any major differences in the possibilities for the young people to obtain alcohol. Furthermore I do not think that youths will drink more than they do today. Look at France and Great Britain, for example. The age limit for buying alcohol is lower there than in Sweden, but young people do not drink more because of that. Can the reason be that a part of the excitement is taken away when it is legal? In Sweden, the youths tend to take every given possibility to get drunk, partly because it is unlawful. According to one of my friends who just came back from one year as an au pair in the United States is the situation much worse there than here in Sweden. In most states, it is illegal to drink alcohol before you are 21 years old, but many people drink before that age anyway. She says that the sad thing in the United States is that the youths are not sufficiently informed about the dangers that follows alcohol consumption. There are not many countries with so many car accidents involving drunk drivers as there are in the United States. Whereas the opposition argues that the reason for having different age limits in bars and at "Systembolaget" is that the consumption is under control when you are in a bar, the people who want a change in the law maintain that this is not the case. I have asked a few friends and they, just like me, had to admit that you rarely notice a bartender or a guard telling a guest not to drink more because he or she is too drunk. Not only would an age limit lowering for buying alcohol at "Systembolaget" make things easier for the young people between age 18 and 20, it would also make much more sense. I think we have to face the fact that young people will always drink, in Sweden as well as in other countries, even if we legislate against it or not. More information about the dangers may help, but I think that a part of the fun with drinking when you are young is that it is illegal...$$$﻿ The Elderly Need the State When a person gets older it is important for him or her to have someone to rely on. About a hundred years ago it was rather obvious that the family should take care of the elderly. Today, however, the situation is completely different because in our society it is difficult for us to look after the elderly. So, we need help and this is where the state comes in. There are many reasons why a family cannot take care of the elderly. Firstly, most families have small children to look after and they need all the time and attention they can get from their parents. We all know that children can be very exhausting and demanding, which makes it impossible to concentrate on another person. If you are not fully dedicated to give the old people your help, it can end with disaster. Also, it can be even more difficult to take care of a person if he is handicapped and cannot manage by himself at all. It is a responsibility that few people can handle. Secondly, most adults today need to work to make a living; therefore they cannot stay at home as often as they did before. Their work takes all of their time. Also, one thing that has changed radically if you look back in time is that some people have to travel a long time to their work. Maybe they have to work in a big city, or in another country. When they finally come home in the evenings they are often exhausted and need to rest. For an elderly person to ask for help can be difficult because he might feel that he is in the way. In such situations it is easy to start a quarrel, which can lead to anger between the family members. Such a relationship can be very stressful but above all not healthy. The elderly need someone who has time to spare. At an old people's home they often get the opportunity to relax, which means a lot to them. As mentioned before, it is a huge responsibility to take care of another human being. Imagine if something would happen. The elderly need special care, and you cannot offer that at home. It would be so much easier for you and them, but above all, safer if they stayed somewhere where help is close. The state can offer special care, which the elderly need so much. They have people who are educated and want to help the person that you love so much. Also, they have all the special equipment needed. Several old people's homes today can offer excellent medical care. It is something that they did not have a hundred years ago, and we should take advantage of that. There are so many people who care about the elderly and they can offer so much more. People can argue that families do not care about their elderly if they send them to a home with strangers. But it is actually the other way around. If you know in your heart that you cannot offer someone else your help, the best thing you can do is to let someone else step in. It is also important that the family tries to visit as often as they can because it means the world to old people. Regularly visits can actually improve the relationship between the elderly and the family. It is mentally hard for the elderly to know that they are dependent on someone else to survive because people do not want to rely on others. In other words, it is important to know that you can manage on your own, without causing concern for your family. We all need to feel independent in some way, both young and old. This is the way people work. To keep your head high and not give up are many people's philosophy today. All in all, elderly people need someone who can give them full attention, but most families today cannot do that. Therefore, it is not wrong to let the state take over. It is for the best, not only for you but for the elderly too.
EE550	0	﻿ English, My English! y history of English is not so unique or different. I have learnt my English mainly at school, and before the third form I could only say things like "I buy pink sheets for a kiss" and "My name is Bettina". I have not spent any longer time abroad, only shorter vacations, but even in Sweden you get in touch with English every day trough television and radio. English has never been a subject that I have thought of as a difficult one, it has always come easy to me. After I graduated from "upper secondary school" I feel that a lot of my English has been forgotten. For the last three years I have studied for a Master of Science and Engineering, and there I have both used my English and discovered that I want to improve it. Below I will try to describe my knowledge of English, as I think of it today. To listen to English is something I am quite used to do. As I mentioned above, in Sweden you hear English almost every day whether you want to or not. In my university studies I have had lectures in English as well as English speaking tutors (or not Swedish speaking). Usually I have no problems in following spoken English, but of coarse this depends on the speaker's vocabulary and dialect. I think that I could have a problem understanding British English with a strong dialect, since I am more familiar with American English from media. One weakness from my point is that it is easier for me to "turn of" an English speaking voice than a Swedish one. As for reading, I do not have any serious problems there either. My weakness is the speed, I do not read very fast, but on the other hand I do not do anything very fast. I am used to reading course literature in English, but there the problem is often to understand the phenomenon described instead of the language. Perhaps I will have developed my ability to read more rapidly by the time that I have finished all the novels in this course. The speaking part of my English is a part that I would like to improve. Still, I am not afraid of talking, not at all, and it doesn't stop me that I do not get it right all the time. I would like to improve my pronunciation, and I would like it to be more British. Also, I want to get a better flow in my language. This I hope will follow if I get a larger vocabulary, and of coarse if I use my spoken English more often. Now I will comment on my writing skill, which I have already exposed above. My feeling is that I have a lot to improve. This is also a part that I think I will have great use for. In my earlier studies I have written several laboratory reports and smaller essays in English, and there will only be more of them in the future. I need to get a better vocabulary and become better at expressing myself in English. Also, I need to improve my sentence structure. I do think that I am able to do some kind of paragraphing and linking, which I get from my ability to write in Swedish, but I do not have the correct words for it I guess. What you can conclude from these thoughts, as it seems, is that I want and need to improve my own expression in English, both in writing and speaking. I want to have a better vocabulary, and to be able to use these words correctly. I also want to have an English expression, and not a "Swenglish" one. On the other hand I am more pleased with my capacity to understand English, by reading and listening, even thou there are always things to improve.$$$﻿I have been studying English for many years, in fact for twelve years in school and then I've been to Ireland for a year. I didn't study English in school so much over there but I lived with an Irish family so I were speaking and listening to the English language every day. I've been learning a lot in school but even after twelve years in school I didn't want to speak it because I didn't have the experience of speaking it. When I went to Ireland I learned a lot, especially to dare speaking English, that it didn't matter if I said something wrong. I learn when I'm speaking not when I don't. Now I want to learn how to speak and write English better. In this essay I'm going to write about my strengths and weaknesses in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. Listening, I don't have so much problems with understanding what people are saying, if it's not about a special subject that I usually don't talk about or if it's words that I usually don't hear on TV, radio or use in a daily conversation. It can also be hard to understand what someone who have an unusuall dialect are saying. The English language is spoken over the whole world and sometimes the dialects are really different and hard to understand. Reading, I like reading books, but my vocabulary is not as good as I want it to be. I often understand most of the sentences anyway but I have to learn more words. I try to look in a dictionary if I don't understand a word or the meening of the word in a sentence. We didn't read much English books in upper secondary school but I have read some afterwards. I think that it is a good way of learning. Speaking, I can make myself understood in English and since I were in Ireland I've improved a lot. But my grammar is not so good and that results in that I'm probably doesn't speak correctly. I think that when my grammar is becoming better I'm going to speak better and enjoy speaking English more. It's fun to speak English when you are in an another country because it's not in so many countries that they speak a second language as good as many people do here in Sweden. I think that I pronunce words quite good when I speak, but not as good when I read for someone because then I havn't seen every word before and it's harder to pronunce them. I can't remember that we learned much phonetic transcriptions in upper secondary school but I think it's really important to learn it, because it's so much easier to learn how to pronunce words when you look in the dictionary and understand the phonetic transcriptions. Writing, As I wrote before my grammar is not very good and that makes my writing not very good either. When I'm listening or reading it's not a big problem but when I speak or write it becomes a bigger problem. I can't explain why I'm writing as I do, the grammar-rules. I'm not that good at Swedish grammar and I'm worse in English grammar. I havn't been so interested in learning the English grammar before, I just wanted to learn how to speak the language but now I want to be able to speak, write, listen and read it better. I have to work hard with it and I'm looking forward to understand it better. Because if I don't understand the grammar I can't learn to write or speak it correctly. Then it depend on what I'm going to write. I think that it's easier to write about a book or compare two books than to come up with something from my own mind. Now I have tryed to explain my strengths and weaknesses in the English language. And if I work a lot with my weaknesses I'm going to improve and enjoy the English language even more. It's useful in so many things. I'm really motivated to study English and learn it as good as I can. My biggest weaknesses is grammar and to make my vocabulary bigger. I think that thats what i have to study the most.
EE553	0	﻿ THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL GYMNASTICS In the last couple of years you might have heard a lot about school gymnastics, whether we should or should not have it as a compulsory subject on the schedule in the Swedish comprehensive schools. When the schools unfortunately have been forced to do severe cut-downs amongst teachers and classes (mostly by economic reasons), it seems like gymnastics has been one of the most frequent classes to be cancelled. Most people have argued for the importance of maintaining this subject in school, but still there has been a few people claiming that compulsory gym-classes are unnecessary and a waste of pupils time. Today's living is far different from the way earlier generations have lived their life. Physic work were part of the ordinary day for them through labour and other daily occupations. Today it is not so, we live a far more lazy and convenient life and the food we eat contains about three times more fat than our ancestor's food did. As a result of this people have grown fatter and fatter through the years. Studies have shown that children in the ages of seven to twelve who do not have gymnastics at their timetable in school suffer a greater risk of being overweight when the are grownups, than children who do have gymnastics. It is also important to remember that it is in the early years of living you lay the grounds for a good condition. And often also the basis for a great interest! Because it is supposed to be fun too! Many children find their future hobby during gym-class. In fact, a study amongst children in the ages of thirteen to eighteen a couple of years ago revealed that sports (school's gym-class included) made the pupils feel healthier both physical and psychological. The test revealed that the students that were active in some kind of sport, believed that without their hobby they would probably be more interested in 'bad things', such as smoking and drinking. The test also revealed that girls of this age rather would date someone who was active in some kind of sport than someone doing such 'bad things'. As I said, schools have been forced to do rather big cut-downs, and people supporting cut-downs made in the gymnastics lessons in the schedule often claim that this is the least important part of the school system. Most of them feel that this physical part of the education is rather important, but also that it would be an even greater loss if we removed, for example, mathematics or biology from the schedule. Another argument is that in today's society you can find a local Gym almost anywhere, that parents should be responsible for their children visiting such places on a regular basis. (Like a school subject, but without any supervising teachers and no grades.) I think most parents will strike out this suggestion as soon as they have found out about the prices most these places have got. It is a well known fact that a whole week of sitting still and studying can make anyone crazy. By Wednesday no one will have the strength of focusing and concentrating. The pupils performances in the ordinary school subjects will get worse and worse and of course the average grade will drop to a lower level. If there should be a government decision to solve this problem, that only some schools should keep gym-classes in their education, pupils in the schools without it, would suffer from it. Their final grades would probably be much lower than pupils from the schools with maintained gymnastics and they would have a much harder time competing into higher education. I think we have got evidence enough that a removal of gymnastics classes from the compulsory schedule would be a great mistake, and that pupils would get affected by it in the long run. Therefore it is necessary to find alternative ways to solve this money problem. Maybe the compulsory schools should not be totally free anymore and there should be a small fee for every student. Or maybe it is up to the government to reconsider how they distribute the tax payers money...$$$﻿ Subject: The family, not the state, should look after elderly. A social problem. There have been a lot of discussions and debates for the last few years when it comes to question who are responsible of taking care of the elderly. Should it be the State or the family? It is a little bit complex because there is obviously a for and an against. Maybe the both sides are actually right but what I am going to do in my essay is to try to focus on these points and to analyse to see more clearly why the state should look after the elderly or on the contrary why the family has the responsibility of taking care of their parents when they grow older. In the first part I will focus on the state and see what it should be done to help making it easier for the elderly. Then in the second part I will concentrate on the family and the responsibility it has when it comes to looking after the elderly. Then in the third part, I will compare these two points and see if there is a way between these two cases to make the best for the elderly. Because the questions are: Is the family, nowadays ready to sacrifice their own life to their parents when they grow older? Does the state feel itself responsible for the elderly? There can be a kind of conflict between the family and the state when it has to deal with the elderly. But it has, of course to be assessed. This subject dealing with the elderly is really a social problem nowadays, people are much more independent. Obviously it depends on what countries we are talking about. I think that the south countries in Europe are much more attached to their family and in this case I think that the families take much more care of their parents. They have this Family notion in their culture; their duty is to look after their parents when they are old even if themselves have a family to take care of, according to this culture, it is evidence. It can be different in countries like Sweden. Swedish people are more independent and that's the reason why the family thinks at first of itself than of their parents. But this is just a hypothesis; in my experience, I have seen that the state takes generally good care of the elderly here in Sweden. They get a lot of help to find people who take care of them even if they stay at home. The care centre here in Sweden hire people as nurses, and home-help service who help the elderly with everything from nursing to laundry, keeping them company and so on. I think that the state here in Sweden feels responsible for the elderly. They maybe pay more attention to them comparing to the south of Europe where there, the state maybe relies to much on the family because it knows that they have a culture like this, their duty is to have this responsibility. Personally speaking, I think that we have to draw some limits when it comes to this subject. What I mean by that is that, I would and I will be ready to take care of my parents but as I say it has its limits. I think that I would be ready to take care of my parents if they became handicapped in some way. But I really do not know if I would be capable to have them in my home and if my parents would accept it either. It is easy to tell this when you do not have a family on your own. I really understand the persons who do not want to sacrifice their family because of their parents. But you can help them without taking the full responsibility for them; the state is present as well, to help the people in anyways. So in fact, there has to be a sort of cooperation between the family and the state. I think that the state has to help elderly in a practical way while the family has to be present to give love, consideration and support. I think that everyone has a duty to perform in relation with their nearest. But I don't think that we have to sacrifice everything when a parent gets worse. They have lived their lives and I think that they really understand that. The children do not need, according to me, to do the nurse's job, the main thing and the most important is to be there with them even if they live in a retirement pension or someplace else. The state does generally a good job here in Sweden and it is very difficult to say if I am for or against the family to take care of the elderly because as I can see, the state and the family has to collaborate.
EE111	0	﻿ More and more people are becoming vegetarians in Sweden Today an increasing number of Swedes choose not to eat meat. Instead many Swedes choose a vegetarian alternative. An increasing number of vegetarian cookbooks are making their way into the shop's bookshelves. On television we watch as chefs make vegetarian dishes and almost every magazine is full of vegetarian recipes. Today you will not find a single restaurant with self-respect that does not offer at least one vegetarian alternative. The offering of different vegetables for sale has increased. This is most likely a result of the increasing number of vegetarians. These are just some examples that show us that vegetarian food is making its way into Swedish homes. But what reasons may have contributed to that more and more Swedes are becoming vegetarians? Is this just a not last long trend or is this just the beginning of a trend that has come to stay? If we go back four years in time to 1997 when the first reports about the mad cow disease surfaced, we see what can be said to be the very starting point for this trend. All over the world people watched as terrifying pictures of animals suffering from the mad cow disease were being broadcast, Sweden was not an exception. Out of a fear for Creuzfeld-Jacobs disease many Swedes stopped eating meat. Media's focus ways often on what risks there were with eating meat and that in many ways contributed to that many Swedes no longer felt it safe to eat meat. It was as though pictures of animals suffering from the mad cow disease were drummed into people's minds. Many people argued that this was just a casual trend. But today we do see this as the very trigging point for the increasing number of vegetarians in Sweden. The number of vegetarians in Sweden is increasing rapidly. Today it is diseases like the foot- and- mouth disease that contributes to many Swedes fear eating meat; it feels safe to be a vegetarian. Another factor that has contributed to the increasing number of vegetarians in Sweden is for sure the news coverage that repeatedly has shown us animals that live under extremely poor conditions. Over and over people in Sweden have come to learn about how animals suffer during inhuman long transports. Pictures of mismanaged animals are also often shown in various media contexts. This has for sure stirred up a lot of feelings among many Swedes. To give up meat is a standpoint that many Swedes choose to make in order to show that they are on the animal's side. Pictures of so called monster-bulls have lead to negative reactions among Swedes. Many Swedes react to how the commercial interests seem to have completely taken over the meat industry. Many Swedes raise protests against this by becoming vegetarians. So one could say that a great number of Swedes choose to become vegetarians out of ideological reasons. By giving up meat many Swedes feel that they can make a difference. Some people may say that these people, who have chosen to give up meat because they feel that there is something wrong with how animals are treated, probably will go back to eating meat once media's attention is focused on something else. As long as we do not se any improvement in the way that animals are treated, more and more people will choose to become vegetarians in Sweden. This is an obvious trend in today's society in Sweden. One of the most important reasons for the growing number of vegetarians is of course the growing awareness among Swedish consumers. A lot of vegetarian recipes are presented b in both magazines and on TV. People have learned how to cook vegetarian food. Vegetarian food is no longer anything that is regarded with scepticism. Instead vegetarian food many times stands for quality. In today's Sweden a great number of people choose to become vegetarians simply for reasons of health. Many people do not eat meat because they feel that their physiological health benefits from not eating meat. As long as the consciousness of health will continue to increase we will also see an increasing number of Swedish vegetarians. How strong this trend really is becomes quite clear when we take into consideration that Sweden's Prime Minister Goran Persson has said that he feels better eating vegetables than meat. That more and more people are becoming vegetarians in Sweden is trend that has just begun. In the future we will probably see even more vegetarians in Sweden. The cause for this trend is that Swedes out of ideological-, physiological- and health reasons choose to become vegetarians. That people choose to become vegetarians is a trend that has come to stay.$$$﻿ Things could be worse than hearing children curse In Shirley Peckham's article she wants to clean up the language after having heard too many swear words from teenagers passing by her husband's shop. According to Peckham, the children ought to be "boxed around the ears". In this essay I will argue against the need of cleaning up teenagers' language, which Peckham argues for. Firstly, I will argue against Peckhams' problem with cursing children. Secondly, I will argue why cursing is a part of adolescence. Thirdly, I will argue how trying to change teenagers' ways of communicate will not do any good. Lastly I will sum up my paragraphs. The issue "cleaning up the language" that Shirley Peckham introduces in her article and the problems it concerns I do not find very worrying. Peckham describes having heard several terrible swear words from children passing by her husbands' shop and a group of boys at a railway station. This observation might be considered interesting for some, but far from sensational for most. Just a few teenagers, who happened to curse while passing by Mrs Peckham, are not very representative for every teenager of Britain. Generalising will not give a fair overview of the situation. Peckham has obviously exaggerated the situation and created a problem, which does not exist. Concerning the language of those teenagers Peckham has observed I consider it being a part of adolescence. Peckham has apparently forgotten everything of being rebellious during the years of adolescence. As I see it swear words are a part of adolescence, at least for some who are fighting through this period of life where many physical and mental changes occur. By using curse words teenagers express their attitudes towards school, grown-ups and society as a whole. Children at this age are tired of parents' and teachers' demands. They want to be rebellious and dissociate themselves from stiff, boring adults. Cursing is one way of doing this. I agree with Peckham to some extent. It would be preferable if teenagers use other words to express themselves instead of using swear words. However, teenagers' swearing is just a rebellious action, something they will get tired of and consider foolish and childish when they get older and more mature. As grown-ups they have more than likely changed and will only curse if getting upset. There might be some exceptions, but there always are. Therefore I believe that children using swear words is nothing to worry about. I do not see the need of searching for solutions of changing teenagers' ways of expressing themselves. Trying to change teenagers' ways of communicate will not do any good. They are rebellions and are not willing to give up any rights of being rebellious. If for instance parents and teachers tell their children and pupils to watch their mouth and stop cursing it might lead to an opposite effect. As tired as teenagers already are of demands and complaints from adults they would probably curse more than ever. Peckham's method of changing children's language by boxing them around the ears, is definitely not an option when trying to change teenager's ways of communicate. I call this corporal punishment, which perhaps is legal in England, but is far from accepted. Peckham should be ashamed of such suggestions. Shirley Peckham has observed some cursing teenagers and has drawn the conclusion that she has encountered a problem that needs to be solved. However, there is no problem. Peckham is just being confused of teenagers' ways of communicate. She is obviously not aware of how teenagers behave when going through adolescence. Cursing is a way for teenagers to dissociate themselves from grown-ups and their demands. This stage of childish action where teenagers want to be rebellions, which seems like a problem for Peckham, is something they are going to grow out when becoming adults. Therefore Shirley Peckham should not worry of matters she has no knowledge of.
EE110	1	﻿ Watchfulness Will Avoid Children Falling Into the Hands of Paedophiles. Last week we could read about ten children, from three to eleven years old, who had been sexually abused by a 22-year-old man. I guess that we all reacted negatively and felt powerless. How could this happen? Many adults were nearby this catastrophe, but none of them reported it to the police. They claimed that they didn't know it was happening. Perhaps they didn't want to know. There were neighbours who had suspicions, they heard screams from the five-year-old boy, the paedophile's steph-son, but they just rang at the door. If a neighbour reacts on a child's scream, that he or she must ring at the door, then the scream is not a normal scream. They also observed that the paedophile always had the curtains drawn and that the little boy was never out playing with the other children. We've been aware of paedophiles before this case. Nobody wants them to destroy more lives than they have already done. If we have children ourselves, it feels very unpleasant to leave them at the nursery every morning. As adult, and fellow-being, I think it is important to react and be aware of this problem and not close our eyes and believe in fairy-tales. We live in the real world, and things aren't always so decent. If we see something that possibly can be about sexually abused children, we ought to report it at once, before it is too late, before it has hurt the child completely, for life. Even if we have slight evidence, or none, even if we only got some suspicions, I think it is our obligation to report it to the police. It is our resposibility, as adults, to stop a possible paedophile for the child's sake, for its best. We can never report it to early, but unfortunately, we can report it too late. So, for the child's best: observe, and don't be afraid of interfering (which we Swedish people usually have difficulties with). If we report someone because we have our suspicions and it turns out that this reported man or woman is innocent, he or she would presumably feel offended. But, I want to claim this once again, if the whole matter is not reported at all, a life of a child can be totally ruined, and that is not easy to repair, if it can be repaired at all. The second argument of reporting to the police in the above matter, is that the person who reported it should feel better, and be proud of him- or herself, that he or she took the initiative instead of the opposite: being quiet and let the whole thing go on. Of course we all want to help, don't we. I wonder, how do the neighbours feel today, those who didn't report it even if they knew that they should have done it. The third argument is that if we all are more aware, and awake, and dare to report, the paedophiles would hopefully feel more watched and observed, and know that we are concerned about our children's security. It should be a warning effect with people's engagement and that could frighten the paedophiles. If we don't report cases with paedophiles involved, then they can do whatever they want to do, because then they think that we don't care, that we are afraid of knowing the truth. Of course we don't want to know what a paedophile can do with our children, of course we can't see at a person that he or she is a paedophile, but we can be more vigilant. Children do trust in us adults, and we must let them continue trusting us. Be watchful and talk to your children, ask them, tell them, inform them. If they know that we are open-minded, that we can report sick people, then they probably will tell us if there is a paedophile in the nearby.$$$﻿I will now write an honest essay about my English and how I assess it. First of all, I love to write! I got very happy when I heard that we, the students in this A-level course, are going to write many essays! When I see a piece of blank paper, I immediately want to fill it with letters. I seldom have any problems with spelling. Once I have read a word, I usually know how to spell it. I think it's easier to write than to speak in many situations. When I write, I can stop writing for a while and just think about what I want to write further on in the text. When I talk it's not that easy to stop and think about what I am supposed to say, because then the people I'm talking to continue to speak, and the very important thing I was thinking of will never be discussed. When I write, I can go back in the text and change and I can change several times, so it's very different from speaking. Maybe that is why I love to write, because I can think in peace and quiet. I guess I've always loved to write, ever since I was a little girl writing in my diary every evening. When I was eleven years old our class found another class, in Great Britain, and they were about our age and we got penfriends. I think I learnt quite a lot by writing in English to my penfriend for many years, and I still write letters, not to her though. When I studied at Komvux here in Uppsala, our English teacher told us to write an essay every week. It wasn't compulsory but I handed in one every week because I'm so fond of writing, and I thought that my teacher could evaluate my English by reading my texts. When it comes to speaking I must say that I am a little bit shy of speaking in a quiet classroom with all unfamiliar students surrounding me. In such situations my English doesn't sound like I want it to sound. It's difficult to speak fluently and spontanleously, but I know that I will practice talking in this course. You should visit me at home and spy on me when I'm doing my homework, because I practically always read aloud to myself to get the right pronunciation by reading the phonetics. It's a habit to read aloud, but I don't know if it's a good or a bad habit. Sometimes, when I'm reading a book in a public place, I think it's difficult to read quiet and I have noticed that I move my lips secretly. After writing comes reading, my second favorite in order. Naturally it depends on the text if it is readable or not, but most of the time I accept all kinds of texts. I do have to confess something, and that is that I think it's hard to read the paper, the news about politics and wars. I think that is like listening to the news on the TV or the radio. They use a different language from the language they often write in literature. But I am aware of my defect, so at the moment I subscribe to Newsweek where I can read international news about Clinton's counterattac and the Olympics scandal (That sounds boring, doesn't it?). Reading novels, short stories and magazines are very amusing but I find it tough to read in bed in the evening, because then I usually read the entire book which means I will be very tired the day after. I think it can be difficult to listen to English, but not in all situations though. I do understand the English when I attend a lecture or when I speak with a person, but when I listen to the news on the telly or the radio, I sometimes feel stupid because I don't receive the information. That is something I really must practise.
EE113	1	﻿ "Miss Celie's Song" In an article, The Only Reason You Want to Go to Heaven Is that You Have Been Driven Out of Your Mind (Accessed June 19, 2000. <http:/ /ehostgw15.epnet.com>), Alice Walker discusses among other things how her parents and grandparents, in the nineteenth and the beginning of twentieth century's United States, were forced to believe in white people's God, and to give up their "belief in their own judgement and faith in themselves". (Alice Walker, The Only Reason You Want to Go to Heaven...) We can see a certain manipulation to go on in Walker's novel The Color Purple, too. In different ways Celie, the principal character of the novel, is manipulated to believe herself being ugly, stupid and useless -not a human being at all. I will now discuss causes for the absence of Celie's belief in herself, and how she is, after all, still able to build up her non-existent self-confidence and gain self-respect as well as the respect of the others. The foundations of Celie being quite easily manipulated lie in the values of society in which she is brought up. The story takes place in the American South in the first half of the twentieth century. According to the ruling values of society, Celie is raised to believe in "big and old and tall and graybearded and white" (201) God who had made white people superior to black people. "...that's the [God] that's in the white folks' white bible. (...) You mad cause he don't seem to listen to your prayers. (...) I know white people never listen to colored, period. If they do they only listen long enough to be able to tell you what to do." (201-202) According to the white people's bible men should also rule over women. "Unto the Woman God said: I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. Genesis 3:16" (Alice Walker, The Only Reason You Want to Go to Heaven...) Brought up in society that believes in men's superiority, Celie, trusting in her white God, accepts her fate as a part of God's big plan without questioning but being obedient to men of God. "Never mind, never mind, long as I can spell G-o-d I got somebody along." (18) In Celie's life the ideas and values of society are embodied in two men especially, her Pa and her husband, both who brutally abuse her and totally trample her underfoot. By raping Celie, and getting her pregnant when she is only fourteen, her Pa, who then turns out to be a stepfather, robs her body, her innocence and her self-respect. "He never had a kine word to say to me. Just say You gonna do what your mammy wouldn't. (...) When that hurt, I cry. He start to choke me saying You better shut up and git used to it." (2) After Pa selfishly spoils Celie's young body and mind, he makes clear that he can't stand her anymore. "Pa say I'm evil an always up to no good." (4) He also convinces Celie that she is stupid and totally worthless by taking her out of school. "You too dumb to keep going to school, Pa say." (11) Celie seems to lose all her rights as a human being. Emphasising her only being an object for others to use, Pa marries Celie to Mr.___, acting more as if he was selling cattle than giving away his daughter. "She ugly. (...) But she ain't no stranger to hard work. And she clean. And God done fixed her. You can do everything just like you want to and she ain't gonna make you feed it or clothe it." (9) Pa also covers up for himself by warning Mr.___ that Celie is a kind of person that lies. (9) r.___, not being able to marry the woman that he loves but still desperately needing someone to take care of his children, finally content himself with Celie, although not literally. For Celie the marriage doesn't change anything. She just moves from one hell to another. Mr.___ abuses her sexually, punishes her for being a woman, being his wife but not the woman that he loves. He makes sure that Celie knows "who got the upper hand" (37), and that she is absolutely worth nothing. "Who you think you is? he say. (...) Look at you. You black, you pure , you ugly, you a woman. Goddam, he say, you nothing at all." (213) Convinced by both her Pa and her husband, the two men of God, Celie seem to have no reason whatever to have any belief in or respect for herself. ore or less brainwashed to think low about herself, Celie doesn't question her situation until she meets two very strong women, Sofia and Shug Avery, who both refuse to be trampled on by men. Mr.___'s son Harpo to Celie: "I want her to do what I say, like you do for [Mr. ___]. (...) But not Sofia [Harpo's wife]. She do what she want, don't pay me no mind at all. I try to beat her, she black my eyes." (66) Celie is jealous of Sofia who can do what she cannot -to fight. (42) Celie hardly knows how to get mad. "All [she] know[s] how to do is stay alive." (18) The crucial factor for Celie becoming able to change her view of herself is her relationship with Shug Avery, the woman that Mr.___ loves -his lover. Shug Avery doesn't only exemplify a strong woman who holds her own, but she is the only person, along with Celie's sister Nettie, who Celie loves and who loves her back unconditionally, and stands for her no matter what. ... Shug spoke right up for you Celie, [Mr.___] say. She say Albert, you been mistreating somebody I love. So as far as you concern, I'm gone. I couldn't believe it, he say. (...) I tried to tease her. You don't love old dumb Celie, I said. She ugly and skinny and can't hold a candle to you. She can't even screw. (277) But [Shug] meant what she said. (277) Shug is the person who patiently teaches Celie about the secrets of her body, to accept and even like her body -to enjoy being a woman. "She say , Here, take this mirror and go look at yourself down there,... What, (...) scared to look at your own pussy. You come with me while I look, I say. (...) It a lot prettier than you thought, ain't it? She say... It mine, I say. " (82) Influenced by Shug, and all the things Celie goes through, she begins to question the white God who she, until then, has had a strong belief and trust in. "I don't write to God no more, I write to [Nettie]. What happen to God? Ask Shug. Who that? I say (...) the God I been praying and writing to is a man. And act just like all the other mens I know. Trifling, forgitful and lowdown." (199) Celie's disbelief in God also makes her question the great injustice she has suffered from. Celie's situation climaxes when she, thanks to Shug Avery, gets to know that Mr.___ has hidden all Nettie's letters, that he during so many years kept her dear sister away from her. Finally Celie is able to feel pure anger and to give vent to that powerful feeling. "All day long I act just like Sophia. I stutter. I mutter to myself. I stumble bout the house crazy for Mr.___ blood. In my mind, he falling dead every which a way." (125) Because of her new-found belief in herself, and her arising faith in God as everything -"Everything that is or ever was or ever will be." (202-203), Celie is finally able to free herself totally from the control of men, and instead hold her own. "I'm pore, I'm black, I may be ugly and can't cook, a voice say to everything listening. But I'm here." (214) "Dear God. Dear stars, dear trees, dear sky, dear peoples. Dear Everything. Dear God." (292) There has always been greed, power-seeking people or groups of people who regard their political, religious, social, and other ideas and values as the best possible, and therefore want to influence and manipulate other people, stopping at nothing. The ruling ideas and values of society then often make the manipulation and the downright abuse possible and silently accepted by majority as a part of reality, as Celie in The Color Purple. "There is so much we don't understand. And so much unhappiness comes because of that."

Accessed June 19, 2000. <http:/ / ehostgw15.epnet.com>$$$﻿ Long Live the school of knowledge In order to respond the demands of the society of today, where various shifts and changes take place at a rapid pace, the Swedish Teachers' Education Committee (LUK), which mostly consists of people with no practical experience from the school, has proposed a restructuring of the Swedish teachers' education programs. In short, the idea of the proposition is to reduce the studies of the special subjects, and devote that time on other issues that the Teachers' Education Committee regards as more crucial and valuable. This proposal has given rise to a fairly large debate in Swedish media, and not in vain. As a future teacher I don't see a point in reducing the subject studies, but in fact I consider the reduction to be a great threat that would lead to a radical lowering of the teachers' competence and moreover the standard of the basic training at Swedish schools. The idea, which the plan of the restructuring is based on, is that the teachers would no more have the intermediary role in the classroom, but they would be there to guide the pupils to find their own knowledge. Therefore the Teachers' Education Committee thinks that it's unnecessary to have as much subject education for the future teachers as they have at the moment, but half the subject studies would be enough. Instead the teacher students would devote themselves to issues such as how the knowledge is formed and how it can be organized. As senior lecturer and teacher trainer Arne Hellden from Linkoping expresses in his article in Dagens Nyheter (May 10, 2000), the proposal appears very ill-defined and vague. School is still a place where pupils are supposed to learn things and develop themselves, isn't it? How can they learn anything if there is nobody to convey the knowledge to them? The view of the teachers being guides while the pupils explore and search out the knowledge by themselves certainly looks nice on a paper and sounds good in theory, but in practice it would lead to a catastrophe. There are too many pupils who are not ready to take the enormous responsibility for their own learning which the Teachers' Education Committee's suggestion requires. The pupils need a person, a teacher who conveys the basic knowledge that lays the foundation of their knowledge development, and creates opportunities for their further education. To be able to act as an intermediary, teachers will definitely need to know how to teach. However, it doesn't help to be professional in knowing how to teach without having something to teach. To half the subject education would drastically decrease teachers' competence, and make them incapable to fulfil the most important duty of a teacher as an "agent" between the pupils and the knowledge. Both the thorough knowledge of the subject and the know-how of teaching are important parts of the teachers' competence. The other should not exclude the other one, but a balance between them should be found. Teachers' education programs have in general a difficult duty to adjust to the changes that go on both in and outside of the school. At the same time the programs have an extremely important role in changing the teacher profession and thus developing the school. While weighing the proposal of the restructuring of the teachers' education, we should keep in mind from which quarter it comes from. We shouldn't make changes that have such disastrous consequences head over heels, and above all, the biggest voice should be given those who then afterwards should put the ideas into practice.
EE112	1	﻿ Society benefits from decrease in working hours Currently there is a vivid debate going on about wether a shortening of working hours from 40 to 35 hours a week should become law or not. The arguments, presented in the article, against the proposition are mainly economic ones, for instance the need for pay cuts corresponding to the decrease, while the arguments for the proposition to a greater extent deals with how we will gain quality of life. In this essay I claim that a law is necessary and to support this I will point to the fact that the arguments for it are important aspects we cannot ignore when it comes to every person's well being. To start with the economic argument, I would like to state that this law would not necessarily have to lead to great cuts in the state activity or pay cuts for the employees. I realise that the reform in question will cost a lot, but I claim that there are other ways to finance it. After having read a debate article in DN2, I realise that this is evidently a question of priority for the state. The authors of this article claim that the money needed could and should be taken directly from the state budget. Today, after a long time of budget deficit, the budget is balanced, and furthermore, the excess is increasing. Accordingly, it is possible to use this excess and I agree completely with the authors' thesis that we ought to seize this opportunity to improve working-conditions when we can afford it. One could say that this reform would be very expensive for the state, but, undoubtedly, the prize is worth paying. This is exactly the conclusion drawn by the committee that was assigned by the government to investigate advantages and disadvantages of the reform.3 It is, however, probable that the increased amount of sparetime and richer quality of life, to which the law would lead and which I will comment on later, would stimulate the purchasing power in general and thus the money would return to the state. Before I turn to look at that, however, I will focus on another argument for a shorter working week; that is, the statement that the unemployment rate would decrease, allowing us to look with revived hope towards the goal to have full ockupation for everybody. France, the first nation in the European Union to legislate for a 35-hour working week, is an excellent example of how this has turned out successful. During the last couple of years, the unemployment rate in France indeed has decreased. The reasons for this, however, can be discussed. Critics argue that the diminishing number of unemployed in France is more likely due to other factors, such as prosperous times.4 Here in Sweden it is also argued that a shortening of working hours would result in increased unemployment at long sight because it acts like a check on the economic growth. Nevertheless, no matter how uncertain the outcome is, I claim that it is worth trying, especially considering the positive effects a reform would have. Lastly, let us look at my main argument, which is that working 35 hours a week will improve our quality of life. A decrease in working-hours would make it easier to cope with the day, especially in physically or psychologically demanding jobs. It would also provide more time for recreation and allow us to go back to work with a larger energy supply the next morning. In addition, the effect of this would be that fewer persons reported themselves sick and we would have less early retirements. Related to this are of course less work-related illnesses and a better health in general. According to a report from Miljepartiet, these positive effects have been shown when the idea of a shorter working week has been tried out. Likewise, more spare time equals life quality as it means more time with our children, and more time to develop interesting hobbies, which definitely makes us more harmonious and content with life. Our creativity is developed; something the whole society benefits from. In short, this debate focuses on the choice between good economy, on the one hand, and a better quality of life, on the other hand. I think we all know which aspect is the most important in politics, and accordingly, I don't think a legalisation of a shorter working week is likely to take place at the moment. But why should economy precede health? Our health and well being is important factors not only for individuals but also for our society in general, regarding early retirements and, simply, the ability to cope with, and enjoy, our jobs and lives. As far as I am concerned, the good effects of the reform in question have not been given enough significance - we would profit from a 5-hour reduction of the working week. Summary of "Kortad arbetstid skadar staten" In this article, the head of the state employers' association claims that a law advocating a reduction of working hours from 40 to 35 hours a week would threaten Swedish economy and welfare. She states that there are two alternative, both negative, effects of this law. Either it would cause great cuts in state activity, such as education, research and police forces, resulting in an increasing load for employees, among other problems, or it would become necessary to cut their wages corresponding to the decrease in working-hours. This would mean a 12,5 percent deduction of their salaries, something that is not believed to be accepted without problems.$$$﻿ Make-up at twelve increasing phenomenon The society we live in today is obsessed with looks and weight. No matter how hard some people or philosophies try to make us appreciate inner qualities, we seem to be convinced that good looks equal success. All kinds of media provides us with infinite cures and diets which promise beauty, and cosmetic products are constantly improved to help us look even better and sexier. And what do we do? We buy their products. What is frightening is that this is no longer a market for grown up women and men, but also for younger and younger girls. Today many young girls cannot go to school without a layer of make-up and dressed in latest fashion. These appearances occur earlier and earlier. Of course it varies a lot from place to place and between individuals, but my impression is that it is more frequently occurring today that girls wear full make-up than it was five to ten years ago. Eating disorders is a common problem, and something which at first sounds unbelievable, is that eating disorders today appear among small children, down to 6-7 year-olds. This is a new phenomenon, that even children of that young age are affected. Why is it that in our society children are no longer allowed to be children, but have to deal with adult problems so early in their lives? Firstly, I think one reason for this might be that our material standards here in Sweden are improving, since we live in a time of prosperity. The companies involved in this "beauty business" are growing wealthier at the same time as we, the consumers, have more money to spend. As I stated earlier, cosmetic companies develop more and more products - you would think there is a cream for everything by now, but soon they invent something new, and with help of media an interest and a desire for the product is created. These companies are continually looking to expand their market, and since young people are easily influenced they become a target group. This target group becomes younger and younger, and the market wider. One possible objection to this argument is that there where lots of beauty products ten years ago as well, and that it provides no explanation for why young people tend to grow up faster in terms of how they dress and use cosmetics. I still think, however, that market expanding and increasing influence of media, for instance through TV and radio commercials, are contributing causes to this trend. Another thing that has to do with how the market creates, or at least encourages a trend towards young people's eating disorders, is what the shops offer. First of all, fashion for young people today is more provocative than it used to be. There is a fashion that reveals a lot of the figure, indicating how important it is to have a neat figure. Furthermore, clothes are actually made smaller today. This is something that was brought up in the TV-program "Rea" a couple of weeks ago, when children, in the form of reporters, were sent out to try jeans and other clothes on. They found that for instance medium size is smaller now than it used to be. In addition, large sizes are produced in fewer numbers than small sizes are, thus making it harder for those with a large size to find clothes that fit. This contributes strongly to the growing number of eating disorders in early ages. In contrast to the two mentioned causes, the next one deals with parental influence. It is a fact that most of the children who today are in the ages from five to ten have parents born in the 60's, and this is of importance for how they raise their children. To exemplify this I would like to point to the fact that they grew up in the 80's, used to high standards of living and to spending money on cosmetics, clothes and accessories. Now it is their turn to spoil their children, who learn to pay a lot of attention to how they look. Still, the final and main reason for this trend is TV- and pop idols. There must be a clear connection between pop idols, with their very undressed and sexy images, and the growing obsession with looks. Pop idols today normally wear a lot of make-up and provocative clothes, and this gives the impression, that your success in life depends on how sexy you are. Consequently, the shape of the idols emphasizes the idea that a slim body is a sexy body and therefore the ideal. In conclusion, all these causes have contributed to the development towards a more and more superficial society where children are forced to grow up earlier. Nevertheless, I think the main causes are media and role models, because children are easily influenced and do not have the ability and knowledge to look critically at their idols.
EE114	1	﻿ TELEVISION - A CURSE OR A BLESSING? Four years of my life have been spent without television. During those years I never felt that I missed anything. Rather I was happy and satisfied with my choice. Many times people wondered how I could manage to live without television. My response was always to hand that question back to them and a bit humorously ask how they could manage to live with it. Today my circumstances are different and I have no choice but to live with television. Of course I have the choice of switching the thing on or off, but what I mean is that the decision of its mere presence or not is beyond my power. If I could choose, though, I would stick to my determination of living without it. If you would ask me why, my simple answer would be that I don't want to waste my time. Because that is what I think television often is, a waste and a great time-consumer. Surely television must be seen as one of the very best among time-consumers. Recently I read a report made by the Swedish board of Education, which showed that an average pupil in classes 5-8 is spending about three hours a day in front of the TV. One must admit that it is pretty interesting to find that people still have time to watch TV in a society where effectiveness is measured in minutes and even seconds. How come students have so much time to sit in front of the television when they don't have any time for their homework? Or maybe that is the reason. Television has the capacity to get one's attention and then take the life and energy out of oneself as something like a big black hole. The weary person who only wants to relax a bit after a hard day's work easily finds himself even more tired after having been in touch with this "screen monster". Surely television is a master to create apathy and emptiness. One doesn't have to go further than oneself to realise that is true. How often have I not wasted hours in front of the television just because of tiredness and a need for rest before setting about my required tasks? What was thought to be a short time has often become hours and time has been wasted. Another interesting feature that I find when it comes to television is how we tend to build friendly relationships based on it. This might sound a bit odd, but believe me it is true. How many times have I not been invited to someone with the intention of spending an evening together? Tell about my surprise when I after a while realise that our time together is limited to our mutual starring at an electric box. Is that what one call fruitful relationships? Today television is about to create a whole society where people have strong difficulties to build deep and stable relationships. Why? The reason is lack of communication. Real fellowship is always based on good communication. And how can one build anything like that when one's time of active discourse is limited to the different commercial breaks and then tend to be all about the ongoing movie? Don't misunderstand me, though. Of course watching a film together with one's friends has its place. The big problem is when we make that all there is to our friendship. And today that has become a real danger. With this in mind it is easy to look upon television as a mere curse. That would be a strong generalisation, though. Surely our consumption of television carries many dangers. But television in itself should neither be treated as a curse nor a blessing. It is our consumption of it that determines what it will become. The challenge is therefore not so much to separate ourselves totally from all there is to television, as it is to learn to control our intake. As long as we let the TV master us it will be our enemy and always cause us a great deal of struggle. But if we learn how to rule over the television it will be a tool that will give us good assistance. The challenge therefore is to turn the curse into blessing by limiting and controlling the consumption. Our level of success of that will determine our future.$$$﻿ EU - THE WORLD'S CHANCE FOR PEACE In recent times the whole debate about Sweden's membership in the European Union has revived. The riot in Gothenburg in the beginning of this summer was only one of many expressions of this and how some people argue that Sweden should now leave the EU. The sad thing, though, is that the same people, who think they are fighting for democracy and against a control of a sovereign power, might actually be the ones who are the greatest danger against democracy in our country. The thirteenth of November 1994 Sweden decided, in a democratic way, that Sweden wanted to be a part of the European Union. So if now Sweden, through a democratic election, has come to the solution that we want to join the rest of Europe and together work for a better world. How come then that some people want to break that up, through mainly peaceful actions but also actions of violence, and call that a defence of this same democracy? That is absolutely ridiculous. The question we also need to ask is; if now Sweden would leave the EU, besides the ridicule from the nations around that we would receive, what are we actually leaving and can we afford it? So often the resistance of the European Union is built on ignorance and a lack of knowledge. It's easy to be against something just for the sake of it. But what really are we against? The core thought of the European Union is peace. Just after the Second World War, when big areas of the European continent were in despair and collapse, some people from key-nations in Europe gathered together to find a solution and to hinder war from ever returning into the heart of Europe again. Out of this came the unity of nations that during history has changed its shape many times, but kept its core focus, and today is what we call the European Union. Through a political union of sovereign but united states Europe has the chance not just to hinder the outburst of war, but also to eradicate the very heart of conflict itself - division. I strongly believe that the European Union together with the United Nations is the strongest force at work today that is able and strong enough to be something of a key in the process of world peace. We must not forget that the two World Wars have taken place based on the European continent. Here the very force of evil itself has been centred. Surely the history has been cruel to Europe, but finally we seem to have learned from it. What was at that time caused by division can today be healed through unity. The European Union enables peace to be a reality and not just a good dream. With the European nations united as one there is no way that a new World War would break out, at least not with its centre on the European continent. So therefore for Sweden to leave the EU would be a big mistake and would also indicate that Sweden is against this very matter of peace on the European continent. It would not be the first time that Sweden did this kind of mistake. During the Second World War, instead of uniting with the allies to see an end to the war, we opened our boarders up to the Germans to let them pass by so that they could invade our neighbours and we go free. We called it neutrality. I do believe we don't want that to happen again. But outside and separated from the EU we would not be able to guarantee our standing against that, rather we would be weak, vulnerable and open for compromises of all sorts. To be alone has never meant to be strong. In the view of this our place in the European Union is pretty obvious. It shouldn't take that much effort for anyone to understand and see that. Sweden has always spoken warmly about peace, justice and freedom. These are "our" words. Therefore we also need to prove ourselves to be faithful those high confessions of ours. Now the world peace needs and is dependent on a strong Europe that is united and not separated and divided. Therefore also our decisions in Sweden must reflect that.
EE295	1	﻿ HAPPY EVER AFTER INSIDE OF A BUBBLE I can understand the problem violence on television causes the Americans. First of all because (believe it or not) there is more violence on television in The United States than in Sweden. While we in Sweden censor the violence scenes and leave the sex scenes the Americans leave the violence and censor the sex scenes. I will leave the question of which way is the best way for you to answer. Secondly there is the fact that Americans are great television viewing people and therefore the American children watch a lot of television. Thirdly, in the United States there is no concept of finishing work at four o'clock p.m. as there is in Sweden and the concept of dagis, daycarecenters is scarcely known. This means that children spend more time at home, alone or supervised, but with access to a television set. With these three reasons in mind we now can start pondering over just how big of a problem violence is in the United States. My first reaction when hearing about this V-chip was a positive one. I believe that it is by far the best suggestion they've had over there for a while. Of course there could be other ways that are better, but until someone comes up with a concrete proposal this V-chip would serve its purpose. Since I have played the part of a typical American youth in the play named Real lives of young Americans, I have lots of thoughts concerning young people and violence. The setting of the play was a High School in the suburban areas of Los Angeles where bomb threats, drive-by-shootings and guns in backpacks were a part of our daily lives. As were the bitterness among my classmates. The route had already been set for many of them. In freshman year, you were late to see your counsellor an suddenly you didn't get the classes you should have taken to stand a chance later in life. They were already picked by someone who were clever enough to go to the counsellor in the summer, before the semester started. Then, in psychology class, there were books only for half the class so you had to go to the library everyday to argue why you should have the one that just were handed in by someone who already dropped the class. This was in fact what happened most of the time, you just dropped the class. That was the easiest way to fit in, do like the majority, be indifferent. Indifference, that's the word. Indifference is what the air in the school was oozing of. The system worked against you and you responded by stopping to struggle and going with the flow, by being indifferent. How does this connect with violence? When I was there, on scene, in the school, I felt the power of this indifference. It poisoned the air and made you see no hope or change of the situation. You stay where you are, with who you are and you do what your friends do. If your friends starts taking drugs, you are likely to do so too, if they are in a gang you would probably join them. And gangs, they know violence. That's how they show each other in the gang, love and respect and that's how they show other gangs and the public that they are to be respected and to be taken serious. As, you see there are other factors then violence on television that play important roles when talking about violence in real life. But, my conclusion is that violence on television can only add more problems to the already troublesome situation in American society. When seeing lots of violence, in real life or on television, you become numb and need more and more to react or to get the same thrills. So, for me, this V-chip is a welcomed way to start fighting. As, Charlie, my American dad put it: "We need to do something before our kids are all destroyed from the inside while we're not noticing it." The voices in the United States which are saying that this V-chip will reinforce government control, and that it endorses monopoly system are, according to me, nothing to care much about. They just signal the Americans fear for federal control and compared to how the situation looks like in Sweden with SVT, they don't have that much to worry about. What to worry about though, is the idea of closing out violence, locking out the violence which exist and putting yourself inside of a bubble. Is that the right way to deal with violence problems in society? Is it the right way to deal with any problem in society? I believe that this is only a way to postpone the problem, whichever it is. I do not believe that one can eliminate a problem by shutting it out, one needs to deal with the roots of the problem. You cannot make weed go away by cutting off what is above the ground; you need to look under the surface. The town of Celebration in Florida is an example of how people try to shut themselves out of the real world while living inside of a bubble. This is a town owned by Walt Disney Company which means that there is no public elected city council. The inhabitants get what they want: calm, peace no crime and violence at the cost of democracy and freedom of choice(Disney decides from which wallpaper one should have to how many your allowed to be in the bedroom!). Disney provides what the inhabitants want and earns money at the same time. Everyone is happy. On the surface. This is, according to me, definitely putting yourself inside of a bubble and leaving the rest of the society to deal with the problems we are all responsible for. My only doubt concerning the V-chip is precisely this; closing out the reality and putting yourself inside of a bubble by excluding movies like American History X and welcoming the Disney classics But, as long as we try to deal with the violence problem on all levels in society the bubble will weaken and finally burst.$$$﻿ "The new order of things proposed": Vision and Reality in Robert Owen's New Lanark and New Harmony Robert Owen cared for people's wealth, health and education. Having such an opinion today is regarded as something common, a normal ingredient in a person's character one could say. What is interesting is that this Mr. Owen possessed these revolving ideas 200 years ago. Even though at first "regarded with suspicion," Owen was to become "the forerunner of Socialism and the cooperative movement." 1 His theories were put into practice in his two utopian communities: New Lanark and New Harmony. In this essay I will give you a taste of what Owen thought and how he applied his thoughts by opening the doors to these two worlds of his. Owen was born and raised in Wales, England. He showed interest in business at an early age. At ten years of age he held a position as an assistant to a clothier in Lincolnshire. At nineteen Owen had attained a manager position of the Manchester mills. He continued his entrepreneurship in Scotland where he soon ran the New Lanark mills. This was to become the pride of his latter career as a socialist thinker. What Owen met at the New Lanark mills was terrible working conditions for the 2000 employees of which as many as 500 were small children. This was by far the worst the experienced Owen had seen in a factory. Child labour was widespread, crime was high and there were no real ethics among the workers. As Owen believed that efficiency and Social reform should go hand in hand, he worked out a plan to improve the productivity of the factory by improving the living conditions for the workers. He cleaned up the factory, improved the housing, and set up stores where food could be bought at cost price and put the alcohol beverages under strict supervision. But most prominent of all his doings was his engagement for the children. Owen was not against child labour but he was much more humane than most in his view of using children in the working force: Owen refused to employ children under the age of ten. At New Lanark mills all children were educated, even the smallest ones, in one of the first kindergarten schools in the world. Owen's actions for children's rights were later to have a great impact on the creation of a law, the Factory Act, securing children's rights in England. Did these social reforms affect the efficiency of the factory, as Owen wanted? What is certain is that during these improvements the factory did have commercial success. If that was due to Owen's skilful inventions such as the use of the American sea island cotton, or his improvements for the workers is still to be proven. Ten years of work at the New Lanark mills made it into a comparatively good place for workers, and it made Owen famous. People went on pilgrimage to see this miracle factory where the children were not filthy and the workers were not drowning their misery in alcohol. Now Owen turned his interest to a larger scale. He wanted his theories to affect not only New Lanark but also the rest of the society. In 1813, Owen published A New View of Society. In this, his most famous writing, Owen wrote down what had become his philosophy: the human character is formed by different circumstances which we, as humans, have no possibility to control and are therefore not to be held responsible for them.2 This differed from the general view of that time, when it was believed that certain people simply was bad by nature and under the spell of the 'existing evil'.3 A person born in poverty is not to be blamed for this personally but to be placed under right circumstances from a very young age and he will flourish. Owen strongly believed in his philosophy and thought that if only people got to know 'the new order of things,'4 they would approve of it. Owen's next adventure was to buy a piece of land in the New World. In 1825 Owen had bought 30.000 acres of land in Indiana, which he named New Harmony. The people immigrating to this settlement were according to eyewitness A. MacDonald, both the "industrious and well disposed of all nations" and also some "black sheep." 5 This adventure in the New World was to be short and costly for Owen. After three years of trying to make the inhabitants get along Owen returned to England having lost 80% of his fortune. How did New Harmony differ from New Lanark? To start with, New Lanark was there long before Owen's involvement, which was not the case with New Harmony. New Harmony had a few settlers there before Owen came, but most came after his arrival and promise of a utopian society. When Owen had set up the first government of the town, a middle way to adapt to his system, he left the town for Europe. During this time people were given medicines without having to pay, some 130 children were schooled, clothed and boarded all at the expense of Mr. Owen. This was not the case in New Lanark where Owen had never given anybody food or medicines for free, but only made it possible for workers to buy quality food at a low price. Another difference was the problems the inhabitants of New Harmony had with how they should govern the town. This led to a series of alternations of the Constitution of the town. All in all seven different ones were adapted and they contained everything from having Owen as sole head of town to having three men as dictators. In New Lanark the people did not have to bother with issues like who governed the town. They did not have to create a whole structure of society. By the time Owen founded New Harmony he had developed his theories that he already had put in practice in New Lanark. Maybe this is where he went wrong; maybe he became too eager to ameliorate something that in fact was not in need of amelioration. Because fact is that New Lanark was a success, a large one. Owen altered some 2000 people's lives and he also played an important role as a pioneer in the socialist movement to come. He was a man who, unlike other philosophers, started out in small scale to continue into grandeur. 1 Encyclopaedia Britannica, "Robert Owen", p., 32.

EE118	1	﻿ Sweden - out of the EU Why did Sweden join the European Union in the first place? The answer is that a referendum was held in our country and the population voted in favour of the Union even though the result was almost 50/50. History tells us that all attempts to put people together with different ethnic backgrounds, different languages and religions, is a failure. My strong but negative standpoint against the EU is not only from an ideological point of view but also from a historical view. We should learn from history, but unfortunately it seems as if history is going to repeat itself. My opinion is that we should leave the union and I would like to bring to light the problems with the Union and to examine whether the Union is good for Europe or not. We should learn from the history. In the last years we have seen cruel and violent wars for independence in a few of our closest neighbour countries: Russia and Yugoslavia. These are two examples of countries with ethnic, religious and linguistic differences that could not live together. Everything ended up in chaos and a lot of people died a completely unnecessary death. We can just look at ourselves and our history. Sweden has dominated Finland and Norway for centuries and even though the history and customs are not so different each country wanted independence. I am of the opinion that the EU will end up in a disaster, some countries will not accept certain decisions made within the European parliament and withdraw their membership. The romantic view of the European Union is the desire to create a peaceful and prosperous Europe among the 15 member countries. The true objective though, is to create a powerful military and political Union in order to be able to rule the world. Both the EU and EFTA were an attempt in the beginning to create a smooth system of transporting goods between the European countries. EFTA abolished the trade tariffs and supported a common agricultural cooperation and I am in favour to this kind of trade union. The difference between EFTA and the EU is that the European Union continues and continues to develop itself. EU tends to expand and wants more member countries, a common defence and a common monetary union. Today the EU account for 40 per cent of the world trade and I see a tendency of megalomania. The EU is not only a free-trade area, as the intention was in the beginning, but the fact is that the cost of the membership starts to retain each country's national rights and independence. Sweden is a small country. Europe has been involved in two World wars in the last century. Sweden has always been neutral and my opinion is that we should remain so. EU law is superior to Swedish law and, in certain matters that might be important for our country might not be biased for other member states such as Greece and Portugal. So who are we? Swedes? Europeans? In my opinion there will occur and identity crises among our population, and it is dangerous to loose that sense of not having your roots somewhere. We are not in the same situation as the United States of America. At least they speak the same language, they built up their country together and they have a common history from their independence at the end of the eighteenth century. The European Union had a basic aim which I found quite reasonable but I am still very sceptical. I always look backwards when there is talk about the future, not because I am nostalgic but because we should study our history, on that basis we should make our decisions for the future. Today we do not know the outcome of the European Union but I hope it is positive of course. How it will come out and reach that aim, no one knows. The only thing I know is that the Union might be good for Europe in the short term, but in the long run it will end up in a disaster.$$$﻿I was watching a program on television the other day (which is very unusual actually, I am not very found of such) and I was lucky to see Monty Python. I was lucky because it is one of my favourite programs, but on the other hand I was very unlucky, or more correctly, I got very unlucky as I realized that my English comprehension was very poor, not very poor, but still quite bad. I started to count the years I have spent with my dear English books through my time at school, and I get it to ten years. It is a rather long time and still there is much to learn. Whereas I did not spend a longer period in an English speaking country I might find it hard to find the "every-day-words" that are so useful for the coherence in a language and in order to make it sound natural and relaxed to a native English speaking person. I have lived in Italy for three years and I started the other way around, which means I started to speak, and after I studied the language. I really do not know which of the two is the best way, but I cannot deny that making an experience in the country is very useful and a fast way of learning. As Swedish normally do, I point out my vulnerable spots. But I know that I am not shy and I don't mind making a fool of myself. In any language I have learnt I have always been very eager to try my wings. I found reading very interesting from different point of views, first because I am interested in literature and second because I want to acquire and increase my vocabulary, and I find reading an appropriate way to do that. I have lived abroad for five years, and even though I did not stay, as I previously mentioned, in an English speaking country, still I have had the opportunity to practice the language and hopefully improved my speaking skills. I master the language and the grammar, at least the basic grammar since I did not study English for a long time. I study Italian on C-level this semester and I find it helpful to compare and exchange differences in the languages and make comparative philology, sometimes it helps you and other times it overturns you. The word "people", for instance is considered as plural in English, while in Italian "gente" is singular, so, I have to pay attention to matters like that. I know it is a disadvantage not watching television that improves ones comprehension skills. It is positive that we do not dub the films, it is extremely good for improving your understanding and I think it is a great advantage that we have in Sweden and I have defended our system many times in Europe. I feel, though, that I would need a refreshment in grammar and the structure of the language. I have been working in Florence for three years and we were working mainly with American clients and that was a crises for me, because the Americans did not understand my British English, or let's say, they had difficulties in catching what I said, so, I sort of "converted" to American English during my time in Italy. When I decided to take the A-course in English I got confused because I did not know weather to speak American English or British English. Soon I found out that it was not of major importance but anyhow I decided to stick to my British English, the important thing, after all, is to be consistent. This course seems to be very well constructed and I have high expectations on myself. I want to improve my knowledge and skills in many ways, mainly the grammatical structure but also my writing and the way to express myself in a correct manner. Not only because I want to understand everything they say in Monty Python, but also for my future job-position where my English will be extremely helpful.
EE480	0	﻿I have always thought I was quite good at English. After the diagnostic test, and while analyzing my skills afterwards, I realized that I am quite good but that I should put the emphasis on quite. In Sweden we are daily surrounded by the English language and for most people, such as I, it is easy to state: I understand English. But what kind of English is it that we hear and read every day, for example on the telly and on the computer? Pretty simplified English I would say. It is all about understanding, reading and listening. Our grammar skills are seldom put to a test and it is not a big thing if you have some difficulties in pronunciation. During my brainstorming I found out that I wasnt't as good as I thought I would be. I can understand and use the English language in full, but I fall short when it comes to important details. I will try to explain this more thoroughly: For example, I am a good listener. I understand the context and can easily follow both general and advanced speech. But if you ask me to translate every single word I would most certainly fail. It is the same thing with reading, I fully understand the context but have some problems with a few words here and there. I know what these words mean in the current context, but I can't find the proper Swedish equivalents or perhaps use the most difficult words in a different context. I am also a tolerable writer. I feel quite confident when I write and people can understand what I am writing. I have all my life regularly been writing to my cousins and friends in the US. This way I learned the every day speech and how to express myself in an other language but I admit, I am not an advanced writer. I like to write, preferably in Swedish, but I have a some what weak English vocabulary which makes it difficult to write more advanced texts. When I write personal texts I sometimes feel blocked and I fear that I sound plain and ordinary. I think I feel this way because I am used to expressing myself in a dramatic and more interesting way when I write in Swedish. I don't think it feels awkward to speak English, my pronunciation is good and I think I have a pretty good flow. I like to talk in general and my communicative skills in English are therefore rather good. The good thing about speaking is that you can clear any misunderstandings and ask questions immediately, things you can't always expect when you read or write. I feel confident when I speak, knowing that I will get a respond and perhaps questions. But as I mentioned earlier, my vocabulary is weak in certain aspects, and in consequence of this it is sometimes difficult to really be able to explain what I mean. I have often experienced that I don't truly represent myself when I speak about my thoughts and more personal things in English. But this is only natural, the Swedish language is a big part of me and one of my best tools when I feel the need to express myself. When I use the English language I sometimes feel dishonest and that I'm not telling the hole truth. I simply haven't got all the words for it. The people I have been talking English to have often been relatives and friends. I haven't always bothered to try my very best, knowing that they would understand anyway. Of course I have been trying to be as accurate as possible but I have also known that my friends don't care if I make a mistake. These conversations have helped and inspired me a lot, but they have also supported my ignorance about details and perfection. I will, during this course, concentrate more on details and really try to improve my vocabulary. This evaluation has helped me; I have not only practised my writing and used a couple of new words, I have also realized a lot of things about my weaknesses - a pretty good start in other words.$$$﻿ Allow homosexuals to adopt children Homosexuals in Sweden can not adopt children. It does not matter how loving they are or how much the child needs them; the law does not give couples of the same sex the right to adopt children. This must be changed. The main reason I have for making this statement is that if you do not give homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals it is discrimination and discrimination of any kind are against the law. Everyone should have the same rights to adopt a child; if you are gay or straight has nothing to do with your capacity to be a good parent. Moreover it should be said that adopting a child is nothing you do over night, not even if you are a heterosexual. The process of adopting a child is long, you and your partner will be studied to see if you are suitable for becoming parents and you will not be approved if you have not thought your decision to adopt trough. Adoptive parents have planned and prepared a long time for their child, they will love and care for it, no matter if they are heterosexual or not. Adoption, and the close study of you and your partner that comes with it, is for most homosexual couples the only way to get a child. Compare this with the fact that a lot of children today are brought up by parents who do not love them, who abuse them and who, in other ways, do not give their them what they need. In addition to this there are children all over the world that do not have a home, who are raised in orpanhages or in other terrible conditions. What would not these children do for a chance to be a part of a loving family, gay or straight. By not allowing homosexuals to adopt we let our prejudice get in the way of the welfare of the children. This is not the way it should be, and I think you all agree with me when I say that it is better for a child to grow up with homosexual, loving parents than to starve to death. One thing that many people uses as an argument against homosexual adoptions is that the children being brought up in an environment like this runs a greater risk to be teased and harassed than children that are being adopted by heterosexual parents. In today's society that may be true, but we can not overcome the prejudices if we bend for them. Racism is a problem in Sweden, like in many other countries, but that do not stop us from adopting black children even though there is a risk that they could be victims of racism. We can not let the prejudices stop us from doing what is right. Another argument that is sometimes given by people who do not want homosexuals to have the right to adopt is that a child needs both a male and a female role model in its life. This may also be right, but it does not have to be the parents playing this role. Far from all children today grows up with both a father and a mother, but that does not mean they do not have someone from both sexes to look up to. Role models in today's society can be grandparents, neighbors, teachers or anyone else that the child might have good contact with. Finally I would just like to say that even if we can not stop inappropriate individuals, such as drug addicts, from having children, we can, and we should, stop the discrimination of the homosexuals and give them the same right as the heterosexuals to adopt children.
EE595	0	﻿ Should the US bomb Afghanistan? The historical events that took place at the World Trade Centre in New York and in Pentagon only a week ago are still very hard to grasp. Now feelings of hatred and anger are spreading through the democratic world, especially in the US. Many want revenge and retaliation and the guilty to be punished. The US really seems to be preparing for war and seemingly the majority of the people in the country are in favour, though attacking Afghanistan may show to be a huge risk. People are in anger and many think that what happened on September eleven is like a declaration of war on the US. It is comparable to the attack on Pearl Harbour that led the Americans to go to war in 1940. This time the free world is not facing an ordinary enemy, though. The enemy this time is not as well defined and is not only a specific country. First of all we have to question whether the US has enough proof to be able to attack Afghanistan. The US has declared war against all terrorism. This includes everyone involved in terrorism and every country that either supports or protects terrorists. Right now the main goals are Usama Bin Laden and the Taliban regime. We have to realise that the US forces are out to fight a limited number of devoted enemies. It is not like they are at war with the entire nation of Afghanistan. The US are on the hunt for the terrorist Usama bin Laden and his followers, presuming he is quilty of the terror attacks, even though no proof of him being responsible has actually been shown clearly to the world. They don't even know whether he is actually in Afghanistan or not, all though most facts points to that he is. The US has also declared war against the Taliban regime because they are not willing to hand out Usama bin Laden and his followers. The Taliban regime refuses to do that because the US hasn't given any proof that his organisation is actually responsible. The US needs more proof! We also have to consider the fact that an attack doesn't assure that the US troops will be able to catch Usama Bin Laden. If the US attacks Afghanistan it will probably cause the death of a huge amount of innocent people, people who oppose terrorism and who oppose the Taliban regime will die. This will lead to even more hatred against the US. People related to victims will always relate the US with killing their innocent relatives and will feel hatred towards them, which itself will create new terrorists and fanatics with the US as the main target. It will also lead to even more hatred among people who already oppose the US. In the political and religious environment that Afghanistan represent, major attacks will only give terrorists and fanatics such as Usama Bin Laden even more reasons to attack the US. Right now the American nation demands that the rest of the world supports them in their fight against terrorism. This also puts pressure on the USA. The American government can't expect the rest of the world to support their fight against terrorism if they do it by killing innocent people. It would be better to show the world that the US really wants a solution to the Palestine problem instead of, like up to now, basically only support the Israeli side. The US should realise that fighting terrorism is not only about military action. It will demand politic changes which goals should be peace in the Middle East and other critic areas. Money should be spent on economical development instead of military aid. The US should also be more willing to cooperate with the United Nations, which is something the US has tended not to in the past. The eighteen suicide Muslims in the attacks of September eleven were probably not stupid guys, they were probably intelligent, devoted and highly motivated after own experiences of violence to their own families, relatives and nations. It is most likely that these eighteen persons were not the only ones planning this attack but only "the point of the sword". There are probably more of the likes to perform more terrorist attacks in the future if the US retaliates blindly and in anger. There is probably also a lot of money in the Muslim world willing to back up such terrorist actions in the future if the Muslim world is bombed. The thing to do instead, to keep the sympathy up for the US cause, would rather be to isolate the terrorists politically, like NATO and England now for the first time in 20 years are doing, negotiating with the former enemy Iran, who's politics only a few years ago regarded the US and Nato as Satan. The other thing of course would be to seriously put pressure on Israel to produce a solution to the Palestine problem that will also be regarded as a reasonable and honourable solution to the Palestine nation. Otherwise there will be more terrorist attacks all over the world in the future. Violence will undoubtedly produce more violence. Since a military action against Afghanistan most certainly will create only more hate against the US in the Muslim world, bombing Afghanistan will only result in more terrorist attacks in the future. Therefore the solution to the Taliban problem and Usama bin Laden is not a military one but a political one.$$$﻿ Just a few years ago I felt quite confident in my knowledge in English. I had read English in school since I was ten years old and I had travelled quite a lot. I thought that I mastered the language pretty well. But what has happened since then? How have my skills in the English language developed during the last three years? Starting with my skills in speaking, I must say that I have hardly spoken English since I left school. This is something that makes me feel nervous and insecure every time I try to speak English. I always want the words to come out right and to be able to speak fluently - and probably just because I want to so hard to speak properly, I tend to stumble instead. I often can't find the right words and I have a hard time trying to figure out how to put things. I seldom know whether what I say is grammatically correct or not. I like making speeches, though, and using the language - both Swedish and English - to express myself. Despite this fact, I get nervous. I think it's because I'm a bit shy, afraid to show other people what I can and can't do. I have overcome this fear pretty much when it comes to speaking in Swedish, so probably it's just a question of getting used to the English language. Another thing is my accent. When I was in the eight grade I was in London for a weekend. At that time people said to me that it sounded like if I was born in England, - no wonder -, I had learnt British English "all my life". Since then, though, I have spoken English to Germans, Americans and people of several other nationalities during competitions and trainingcamps abroad. On the television I have mostly heard American English. I guess I'm quite confused - do I speak American English or British English, (I hardly know the differences,) or is it something totally different? Also when it comes to writing I feel that I have forgotten about how it's done. I have the same problems with finding words and with seeing the linguistic correctness as when I'm speaking. Of course I don't feel nervous in the same way, because I know that I can always stop to think and to look up words. I'm sure that one can easily see in my writing that I'm from Sweden. I have a tendency towards thinking in Swedish and then trying to translate my thoughts directly into English. That doesn't always turn out too well... To my advantages, though, I can say that I'm a fast learner, and that I usually don't think that spelling is a very big problem. Listening to and reading English are two skills that I have used a little bit, also during recent years. I haven't travelled much lately, but I often hear spoken English on the television. I think that both my listening and my reading abilities are rather satisfactory. (That is, of course, when the language isn't too advanced.) Even if I don't understand all of the words, I can usually see the context, and understand most of what is said or written. In high school I studied the A and B-course in English as compressed courses, which means that we only studied English for the three first terms in high school. I really think that one learns the language better if it's taken continuously during the whole three years of education. You need some time to digest the information and to practice the language for a longer period of time. The way we did it I felt that when I graduated I had almost forgotten ever reading English. I think that this is one thing that have affected my knowledge in English (words for an example) a bit negatively, compared with how it would be if I had read it for all three years. To sum up I can say that what I need is to learn more words and grammar, to read and speak a lot, to get more secure, - in short terms; to practice. And I guess that practice is what I'm going to get this term, while reading English A1 at Uppsala University.
EE057	0	﻿About twenty years ago I knew two boys who lived in London, John and John. We met at a party in Stockholm and after that we became friends. We started to write to each other and continued doing that for about two years. I also went to London with a former boyfriend to visit them on two separate occations. This friendship became very usefull for my English vocabulary and to all of the subjects I am going to write about in this essay, that is; speaking, writing, reading and listening in English. Unfortunely John and John just disappered after those two years, I continued writing to them, but there was no reply. My relationship to English nowadays is just that I am very fond of the language, that is mostly the British English language, I am not as fond of American English though. And I have two editions (!) of the "Complete work of William Shakespeare", that I read out aloud from, sometimes when I am all alone at home. The reason that I have got these books is that when I went to school in the ninth grade, me and my friend Helene played in a schoolplay and the name of the play was "Richard III " by William Shakespeare. After that our interest in the English language was awaken and has been more or less ever since. Helene and I formed a sort of club were we looked at old English and American movies from the fortieth, fiftieth and sixtieth, and our favorit actor was the great Laurence Olivier who spoke English like no one else. We also used to write to all sorts of actors, in English of course, and ask if they could please send us their autographed photos and we did get quite a lot of replies. But time passes by, you get older, Helene and I grew apart and formed our seperate families, so now I have no one to speak English with anymore. Four years ago I went to Skeppsholmens in Stockholm, were I, among other different subjects, studied the third year of highschool English. We had a teacher called Yngve who was very enthusiastic and inspirering to us who went to his English lessons. We sang Christmas carols and read aloud from all sorts of poetry. It was a very fruitful time for me, I hope that I will become as inspirering as an English teacher as Yngve was. As I mentioned earlier in this essay I unfortunetly don't come in contact with the English language nowadays. The last book I read in English was "Brave new world" by Aldous Huxley but that was four years ago, but of course I recite Shakespeare, in front of a mirror at home, from time to time, though the Shakespearian language is very tricky to understand sometimes. If I had the time I would translate the parts I read at the same time. One of the things I like about Swedish television is that they have the translation of foreign teveprogrammes at the lower part of the television set and that they don't dub like they do I many other contries. In that way both children and adults learn to listen and understand other languages than Swedish, even if most people you talk to nearly always look at the translated text and so do I. But I have started to think about it since I began this English course at Uppsala university, and if I lived alone I would probably put a tape over the former mentioned text. The thing I want to say is that I have learned much from just listening to English on teve and since there are so many British programs and also British movies with such a high quality it is so interesting and so much fun to watch those. I have not the same experience of English as many of the other students I have spoken to at Uppsala university, many of them have been for example in the United States as exchange students and of course you learn so much more by being "forced" to speake English since no one or very few speak Swedish there. But it feels like a have a little grasp of the English language that I like so much.$$$﻿Looking back through my years at school, thinking about English as a subject, the very first memory I have is from 7:th grade. In the beginning of that first semester in junior high, my teacher asked the class if anyone was interested in having a pen-friend from an English speaking country. It sounded very exciting to me so I put down my name and address on the application. I ended up with four pen-friends from different parts of the world. Two of these girls I kept writing to until I reached my twenties. I actually met them both, too! One girl was from Jamaica, and I visited her as a part of my third year project at "gymnasiet". The other girl was from California. I had the chance to meet her when I was working as au-pair and I was lucky enough to be there at the time of her wedding. Apart from writing English in school, these letters to my pen-friends are the only training I've had in writing. It probably helped improve my written English but what it mostly contributed to, was to enhance my interest in English as a language. It was not a favorite subject up till then. Anyway, improving my written English is what I think I most of all need to focus on this semester, especially the grammar. When it comes to listening to English, on lectures, television, radio and so on, I think I do understand most of what I hear. Of course there will always be a few words that I am not familiar with but when I hear them in a context it's usually not a problem to understand. When I watch English or American programs on TV, I always listen to what they are actually saying in English instead of only looking at the subtitles. There are many shades of meaning that gets lost in the translation. As I mentioned above, I have been able to practice my English skills abroad. My longest period of time in an English speaking country was when I worked as an au-pair in California for 14 months, 1982-1983. I didn't take any English classes during that time, unfortunately, but I think I improved my vocabulary quite a bit, which is now being very helpful when I have to listen to English lectures and read a lot of English literature. Reading has always been one of my favorite things to do. I have the ability to get lost in a book to the point where I am totally unaware of what's going on around me! To my husbands annoyance sometimes... But I believe, that ability is what makes me enjoy it so much. When you let yourself go, and really disappear into a book, you get a much deeper experience out of your reading. Reading is probably the skill I feel I am the most confident in, so literature is my favorite course this semester. The best part is that you get to read authors that you otherwise may not have read. The lectures that follows each book and also the small group discussions afterwards gives a deeper understanding that you never get when you read a book by yourself. I really look forward to these lectures and seminars. I said in the beginning that having pen-friends made me take a larger interest in English as a subject. After the 8:th grade, that growing interest made me convince my parents that I had to go to Wales on a language course for four weeks. Those weeks, in Colwyn Bay, made an even bigger difference. My friend and I stayed with a very nice family and since we were surrounded with the English language 24 hours a day, it really helped improve our English. Before that, I had been rather quiet in the English classes but when I got back from Wales I wasn't afraid to speak English anymore. That made English even more fun. Later, my year as au-pair gave me additional experience. But it is irritating that I don't have the same vocabulary when I speak, as I have when I read or listen. I often feel frustrated when I have things to say but not the correct words to express it. As an au-pair I often felt I couldn't discuss certain subjects, like the Swedish welfare system for instance, because I didn't know the words. That made me feel both younger and less educated than I really was. I hope that I, during this semester, will improve my English so that I can feel more confident in my speaking and writing.
EE599	0	﻿ EVALUATION It is pretty ironic when you think about it - me, being interested enough in another language to study it at university level. I mean, as a child I was, without exaggerating, AFRAID of people who spoke a language that was different from mine. There was this Finnish girl on our block and every time she tried to say something to me in her mother tongue I would run away! Despite this, here I am now, half an eternity later, studying languages, devoting this particular semester to English. ost people's first experience of a foreign language, at least if it occurs at a very early age, is listening to it. This applies to me when it comes to English. Records were played in our home when I was a kid, and I managed to memorize the lyrics as foreign sounds, or as thousands of different phonemes if you wish, that meant nothing to me at the time. Today when I hear the same music, I notice that I still remember those sounds but now as meaningful words and I can therefore sing along! This I find rather amazing. I guess this means that I am fairly good at listening. Having spoken about singing (something, which I enjoy very much by the way) I would like to move on to (speaking about speaking". I would say I have always been good at copying the way in which other people speak. When it comes to choosing between British and American English, besides one or the other being what you hear more often, it is sometimes a wannabe thing. My first idol of any kind (and of course in my case it was a musician) was American, which, I would say, naturally led to my wanting to speak that way too. But then how well you speak the English language does not necessarily depend on how well you know its structure or how many words you know. If you have difficulty in expressing yourself in your own mother tongue you surely will not do any better in English. I actually feel that I lack certain skills here. Is there a way of making your brain work faster? Reading the lyrics of musicians and reading an English book are two things that are worlds apart. Although it certainly depends on what kind of book we are talking about. But in general the English language is a very formal one compared to Swedish, whether it comes to politics or anything else. However, I am usually not intimidated by an English (well, I shouldn't say English really, it could, for example, be an American one too) text as I normally manage to get a good grip of its context. What does bother me a bit is not having the time to look up the meaning of every word that I am uncertain of. I am the sort of person that would like to be able to do just that, which might just be a case of my having high demands on myself. The only time you really have to know all the words that are being used is when you write something on your own. My experience is that writing was not being practised enough in my Swedish (upper secondary) school, with the emphasis on practised. When it did happen the teacher's attitude was something like: (Now you are going to write an essay, if it's good, good for you, if not - too bad!" You never really got to work on your skills. So the question is, am I good at writing when it comes to the English language or not? That remains to be seen now that I am attending a university course in the subject. If my skills are not sufficient, now would be the chance for me to improve them. Now I have (said my piece" about how I feel about my English, that is, how well I am able to use different aspects of it. My conclusion that I manage handling those parts the best, whose existance other people have created for me, that is, listening to what other people say as well as reading what they wrote, probably says something about how much (or rather how little) school teaches you to practise your own skills, speaking and writing. But, to those to whom this may not sound all too optimistic I would like to say: Don't worry, just keep playing that favourite music of yours and you will learn!$$$﻿When I went to school, I was especially interested in learning foreign languages. In upper secondary school I took every opportunity and studied English, French, German, Latin and Italian. The language that I had problems with though, was English. I liked it, but I began to think that there were too many words. In upper secondary school you also are supposed to know many words, since you then have studied English for such a long time. But I couldn't handle them. For about two and a half years ago now I finished school and had at that time studied English regularly for nine years. Since then I have read some English books, but unfortunately not spoken many words in English. This essay is about my present skills in this complex, but rather fascinating language. Spontaneous speaking is one of my weaknesses. I don't have a big vocabulary and when I open my mouth I often get stuck at words and find it hard to find a new way out. Sometimes I can't think any more. So above all I'm nervous about speaking. I feel that I'm not used to speak and I feel rather unexperienced. I haven't been in a country where English is spoken for more than a few days and there been forced to speak, which must be so useful. In school when you spoke you often read the words from a paper. So I am uncertain of speaking, and psychologically most uncertain when many people are listening and I have to speak about something I don't know much about. That problem is connected with my personality too. I think I can pronounce most of the words right though, and get my English to sound quite well. I'm good at phonetics but maybe it mostly depends on that I'm good at imitating other languages. The other communicative skill - writing - suits me better. It differs from talking as you can take your time and reflect over the grammatical construction of a sentence and look up the difficult words. I have always found it amusing to write in English. I get quite careful when I'm writing and I want the text to be grammatically correct. I have always been one of the few who think that grammar is fun. But I also get uncertain rather often and have to guess, especially about prepositions and word order. I think that I can count spelling as one of my strengths too. As I don't have a big vocabulary, I'm a slow reader. Always when I'm reading I stop and think about that there are so many words that I don't understand. But actually you don't have to understand every word. If I just concentrate and exert myself I use to understand the whole. Some words I also understand with help of the context. I have realised that it's just to keep on reading. Words come back and finally you understand them. If I would look up all those words, that I don't understand, I would forget what the text was all about. And that is something important when you're reading, I suppose. But when I find the text especially interesting I use the dictionary a lot. Words that seem important and words that keep coming back I also use to look up. When you listen, you can't stop the person who's talking in the middle of a sentence to look up words though. Then it's just to concentrate, to look like you understand and nod. (Or shake your head if the person begins to look strange at you.) I often feel rather stupid. If a person speaks just a little unclear or fast for example, I get problem to distinguish the words. Also words that I really know run into each other and I don't catch them. And when I get stuck at some words, I sometimes stop listening. Then I don't get the point of course. American English is also harder to understand than British English I think. Now it seems like I only have problems with understanding spoken English, but actually I do understand most of what people are saying. And if I just continue to listen, read, speak and write, I can only get better.
EE582	0	﻿ Too Big to Be Beautiful - A glance at Swedish pre-schools When I was recently working as an unqualified teacher in a Swedish pre-school, I found myself, alone, in charge of a group of 20 children. In the afternoons I was sometimes responsible for a group of 34 five- and six-year olds. Several of the qualified teachers were on sick-leave. They were burnt out. One afternoon, one of the children disappeared. When his mother came to pick him up, I had no idea where to find him. We looked for 30 minutes before he was found. His mother cried. The boy cried. My legs were trembling. At least nobody was hurt this time. I spent other days in the forest with 40 children and two substitutes, who were only there for the day. I made sure I brought a cellphone, in case something would happen. When working as a pre-school teacher, two eyes are not enough. My experience tells me that the Government has to spend more money on childcare in order to reduce the size of the groups of children and to prevent the burning out of teachers. Groups of 20 children younger than six years old are far too often in the hands of inexperienced and unqualified substitutes. This is shocking and unacceptable. But luckily, it is not unchangeable. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with the Government. It is the Government that has been the driving force in the development of a society dependent on a state childcare system. It has been their policy to promote a system where all children receive equal education and care, as a part of the work for a society with equality of opportunity and equality between the sexes. The tax system has, for these reasons, been reformed. Today, taxes are supposed to finance childcare. As a result of this policy, it is impossible for many parents to stay home with their children. Many cannot afford to work part-time. As a result, most children at the ages of 2-6 spend several hours in institutions. Some children are left to the care of the pre-school teacher for over ten hours per day. It is therefore obvious that the childcare system has to keep a certain standard unless working class children and children with a single-parent, will yet again have different opportunities. The standard, however, cannot be maintained without funding. Despite its responsibility, the Government has carried out economic measures, which have had negative effects on the size of the groups and the quality of the childcare. A change of policy is necessary. The economic measures taken by the Government have been said to be necessary to keep the budget in balance. This has been the main aim of the central government as well as of local authorities. The budget is usually an economic plan for a short period of time, a couple of years at the very best. The cuts in public spending will, however, have a different effect, in the long run. The impact on society can be disastrous, as the main object of pre-school education is socialisation. Children in pre-school are developing social skills such as empathy. They are supposed to learn to function in a group and understand the rules of human interaction. Small groups and educated teachers are vital to this process of socialisation. Children have to be seen and cared for in order to learn to see others and care about them. It is clear that the present situation in the Swedish childcare system will lead to social maladjustment, such as truancy, violence, criminality and drug-abuse. Society will sooner or later have to pay. The pre-school teacher is not only a role model, but also a guide. He or she is essential to help children solve conflicts and help to explain phenomena in everyday life. Children also need help to express thoughts and feelings. They need help to develop their language in order to become full-grown, independent, reflecting human beings. In pre-school this is done best by conversation in small groups. The early years in life are crucial when it comes to giving children a base to stand on for further education. In a society where education is continuously becoming more and more important, it seems peculiar that pre-school education is put at a disadvantage. Today, pre-school teachers are not only responsible for a large group of children, they are also occupied with cleaning, doing dishes, drying clothes etc. The children do not receive a pre-school education of any quality. The do not even get the attention they need. Meanwhile, teachers are becoming burnt out, and always feeling inadequate. This is all due to insufficient funding. I am therefore sure society would gain from spending more money on pre-school education, from an economical as well as an educational point of view. The most obvious point of view is, of course, the human one. We cannot treat what we value most as cattle. Pre-school education has become a way of storing children. The only way to deal with this and to secure the quality, is by reducing the size of the groups and increasing the number of adults, educated teachers, in pre-school. This responsibility lies with the Government. At present, it cannot even be guaranteed that parents will find their children, safe and sound, where they left them in the morning.$$$﻿ Television and our conception of society Television has a powerful impact on many aspects of human life, both on individuals, family life and the society as a whole. It provides for a substantial part of all information we receive, thus affecting our conception of the society and our own roles in it. That is the topic for this piece of writing, and I will argue that television has many benefits when it comes to providing such information, but also that there are some negative aspects. Human civilisation has become increasingly more complicated during the last centuries. At least in the more developed regions, it is now more diversified and efficiently organised than ever before, both within countries and between them. We have seen an enormous technological development, but also a political and social development that is equally important. As a result, people are affected to a large extent by decisions taken very far from their own environment. I think it is more difficult today than ever to understand how the society works. This means that it is difficult to identify your own function in society, which might result in a feeling of detachment and a lack of interest in and responsibility for collective issues. The obvious remedy for this problem is information. As a provider of information, television has some advantages before other media. Television can bring the whole world to your TV-couch. It makes distances shorter, both in time and space. You can see important events live and watch in-depth interviews with prominent people. TV is also a good medium for showing the reactions of other people, and it can show demonstrations, riots, disasters, celebrations etc. in a way that written media cannot. It is a good medium for identification with people living under very different conditions than your own. TV-producers also promote this identification, for instance by using "ordinary people", often interviewed in the street, to comment all kinds of events on the news. Off course other media such as newspapers or books are also good and in many ways better than TV, but moving pictures provide strong experiences without requiring much effort from the viewers. That is probably an important reason for why television has such a great impact. Thus I believe that television is really helpful in creating understanding and a sense of belonging that is important both for individuals and for the society as a whole. Television, as well as other media, can also increase the feeling of detachment. This is to a large extent caused by difficulties with dealing with and understanding the large information flow. Specifically, I have two things in mind. First, TV-programmes are often focused on the most dramatic events. News and issues are chosen from a whole country or maybe the whole world, which means that there are always a lot of dramatic news and issues available. Second, TV-programmes are often focused on bad or negative things. This might lead us to some incorrect conclusions. First, our own lives might seem pointless if we relate them to everything that goes on in the world. Second, we might think that the world in a much worse condition than it actually is. As an example, most people have seen strong live transmissions about famine in a few African countries, but I don't think so many people know about the greatly improved standard of living in most other African countries. The overall wrong conclusion would be that everything is just getting worse, and that there is nothing you can do about it. I have only made a small number of reflections, so there is not much to sum up. However, I think that the positive things with television outweigh the negative ones. We get a lot of important information from TV about society, even though we might miss much of importance and we do not always understand what we see. One can ask what we would do without television - to what extent we would read or listen to the radio instead and to what extent we would do other things. I guess that we would end up less informed than we are today, if not other media such as Internet took over. It's also possible to do something about the problems we have with television today. One thing that I believe is important is that people become more familiar with how news and issues are selected. Maybe there should be a TV-program about this. Another thing, that is not only a TV-matter, is that we must be able to see things in the right proportions. Human beings are not designed for being engaged in all the problems of the whole world - there is so much worth dying for that it would be impossible to live.
EE594	0	﻿When I first got this assignment I got really confused. I have written quite a lot during my school years but I have never been asked to evaluate my own skills in English. You can ask why though, because when I come to think of it, it might be a good method to find out how to use your better skills when practising your poorer sides. I am fairly sure that in my case my different skills are linked with the amount of practise I have done in the different components of the language: writing, speaking, listening and reading, that is. But another factor to bare in mind is that we all are different individuals and that we also have different ability to use the same different areas of the English language. I shall start this evaluation with the part that I think I do the best, speaking. I am a very talkative person and if only I am with people I feel comfortable with speaking English is nothing that bothers me. Another reason for me speaking English relatively well is all practises doing that. I spent almost a year in London and even though I was an Au Pair with lots of other Swedes around me I tried to meet as many native speakers as possible. Unfortunately, the discussion most of the time was in an informal way and with people that did not have perfect grammar themselves. Most people did not judge me for my grammatical mistakes or the choice of words but for what I actually said. If fluency is what you want to accomplish that is probably the best way, but I hope that this course will make my grammar and vocabulary better, which would make my oral language better as well. You should always aim higher, but I am glad that I feel rather comfortable speaking, because in most situations I reckon that fluency and the wish to express your thoughts are worth more than speaking correctly. Another thing that I am pleased of is that the year gave me a British accent. I think that I am quite a good listener, in the meaning of understanding what people say when speaking English. Listening, to me, is connected to speaking. As much as I have practised speaking I must have practised listening. I understand British English better than I do American English. Having lived in a suburb with a great many people with an Indian origin I sometimes think I even understand that accent better than the American accent. Writing is absolutely the part of the use of English that I lack the most. Most of the English that I know I have learnt from television and from discussions and in neither of these I have seen all morphemes, phonemes and spelling that show me how the same discussion would look like when written. But another reason for me lacking confidence in writing could be that the language gets more explicit and that is why it feels like nothing comes out right. Most of the writing I do nowadays is by writing letters. Unfortunately, you do not get the very useful feedback. And as the people that I write to are my friends I do not feel obliged to write grammatically correct and in a formal way. One thing to bare in mind is that I feel about the same in writing in Swedish. I am just one of those people that find it easier to express myself in speech than in writing. By reading more books written in English I hope to gradually improve my writing skill. Now to the last part of this discussion, reading. Reading pure literature is one of my favourite interests, and I do not mind reading in English. Most of the time I understand the context and do not have to look up words. I know that my passive language is greater than my active language. My aim is to read a bit faster but I know the reason why I do not; I just love the English language which makes me spend time to pronounce words and think of the expressions that I just read. Hopefully, this will do me some good in the long run. I am glad I was given this assignment, because it gave me a chance to pinpoint my skills in the four components of the English language. Thinking of and knowing my strengths can make me more confidant, and the strengths are useful to be aware of, as I want to improve.$$$﻿This an essay about my experience from studying English at school and in my spare time. In my early school years I did not pay much attention to the English language. I can not remember very much from these lessons. Only at the Junior High School could I remember the lessons. It was not too fun with a lot of small tests every week. My grade was better these days as the English exams were not too hard. Occasionally, at the Senior High School we watched movies with the Swedish subtitles covered. Otherwise, the lessons were like those at Junior High School but a little more difficult. My teacher's pronunciation was a little bit bizarre though we understood what she said. She was a Swedish teacher of Spanish too and probably Spanish was her best language. For me, the English language did not belong to the most important subjects because I was more concerned about my maths, chemistry and other science tasks so I did not study the language too hard. In fact did I study German a lot harder because the teacher we had was a lot more inspiring than our English teacher. It is very important with a funny and inspiring teacher to learn a subject. Of the four skills: reading, speaking, writing and listening I would say that reading is the least difficult followed by listening and speaking. The most difficult is writing. When I was younger I played role-playing games, most of them written in English. I think, though, that most of my knowledge of English comes from English films and programmes on TV. Unfortunately, most programmes are subtitled in Swedish, but I listen a lot to what they are saying. Most of the music I listen to is from the US. Because I listen two or three hours a day I learn a few new words. Maybe not so proper English but anyway I have learned some words from the lyrics. My father was reading to me when I was a little boy and I learned some words from that. In my spare time I don't read many books as I'm a slow reader. I have to look up quite a few words in a dictionary as well. Now at the university most of our books are written in English. Even some books we read at ILU are in English and of course all our science books are in English too. The problem is that you only try to understand what the text is all about and not how the sentence is structured. You only pay attention to the contents and not to the form. I usually don't speak English, only when I am at a party with foreign students and maybe sometimes when my mother invites friends from African countries or from other parts of the world. When I speak English I can make myself understood but the grammar is perhaps not always excellent. I have been to a English language course for three weeks on the Isle of Wight but I was young and did not pay much attention to the lessons, only to the girls. When I were at my host family's house I spoke most of the time with my friend in Swedish instead of English. I think you had better live on your own so you have to speak English all the time. As you may see I need to train speaking a lot more. y experience of writing is very limited. I don't have any pen friends so I have only written English texts at school. There were not so many essay writings during my time in school. Most of the time we wrote short sentences and not longer texts at all. So I am prepared to study to improve my English in every one of the four skills.
EE259	1	﻿ Thoughts about children and fictional violence. In this essay I am going to discuss the effect TV violence has on young viewers and why children are exposed to violence on television in the first place. There are different aspects of this issue and I will take up some of them, such as if children are effected by violence on TV, how lack of role-models can be a part of this problem and how parent's attitudes towards TV violence affects the child. Can children separate reality and fiction? Studies have shown that children find violence on the news scarier than the violence of action fictional violence. I think this is a healthy sign which indicates that children are able to distinguish between the two. Still the dividing lines between facts and fiction are more vague when you are a child than when you are an adult. Every grown up person knows this form experience. This is why I find TV violence so disturbing. Because children have lively imagination they to not always separate television and real life. Therefore there is a risk of them not understanding that the violent behaviour they see on television is not accepted by society. Since TV programmes seldom show realistic consequences of violence children do not get real insight of how destructive it is. In many TV shows the characters are divided into good and evil ones. The evil characters are always more violent and this teaches children that violence is wrong in a way but in many cases the "hero" of the programme also uses violence. As long as violence is used for a good cause it is all right, seems to be the message of a lot of shows. I have seen many boys who try to copy action heroes. An example of such heroes are the "Power Rangers" who have caused a lot of debates a few years back. I happened to be in the United States when this show was very popular so I saw how it effected young people there. A little boy I used to baby-sit wanted to be a "Power Ranger" and learned the different fighting techniques. When he and his friends got together someone often ended up getting hurt. This shows how violence on TV has influence on people. Now back to the subject of limits. It is the parents' responsibility to set limit for their children, in order to give them good values. The problem with television is that a lot of parents have lost control of it. One problem is that the parents have no control of what is being broadcast on television, another that they don not have time to be present at every moment the child is watching television. Television often becomes a babysitter when parents for example have to work a lot. If children do not have their parents as strong role-models they are more likely to find roll-models on TV. That is where TV violence comes in again. Since a lot of children watch action shows, the pattern they learn is that everything can be solved by violence. Even for parents who have strict TV rules at home it can be difficult to prevent their children from seeing violence since children often spend a lot of time at their friends' houses where the rules may be more liberal. Not all parents believe that their children are affected by television. My father is one of these people. When I complain about him letting my younger brother watching ex-rated films he just says "Don't worry about it. He dosn't find it frightening." This may be true, he may not find it frightening, but if that is the fact I think that that is equally disturbing. Even though the problem of children becoming violent because of television shows is more severe, I do think the blunting effect TV violence has also is troublesome. I have now mainly acknowledged the problem of violence being accessible to children through television. Since broadcasters do not take moral responsibility and censorship is not allowed it is completely up to the parent to set limits for their children. I have taken up how the lack of parental involvement and guidance is not only a problem since it allows the children to watch more TV but also because it makes the parents weaker roll-models, making the child more dependent on images of heroes and idols on TV.$$$﻿ The Only Good Indian Is a Dead Indian. This essay is a critical study of texts about Indians in the end of the 19th century. I will give account for both the positive and negative views white people had of the original habitants of the United States. The view point varies a lot in the different texts but most of them are written in the 1880s. The most negative attitudes towards Indians are presented in the text by Walker. He clearly sees them as inferior, primitive beings and in many ways almost like animals. This is mainly shown by his opinion that in the conflict between white settlers and Indians, Indians are not fighting for the same honorable reasons as the white, but rather because of their instincts. "They cannot entirely subdue the savage instincts to roam at will, to defy restraint, and to indulge their lawless appetites for blood and plunder." (p.1) "glutted their fiendish thirst for blood and torture" (p.3) But he also thinks that they are acting out of evil and that they are deceptive enough to "re-enact the role of good Indians" (p.3) in order to get benefits from the whites. First and foremost Indians are seen as the enemies, the fiends. In the less violent encounters with Indians they have shown to be rude and disrespectful. Walker writes about one such meeting where a Peace Commission was sent to Sitting Bull. He says that the "distinguished visitors" were met with "savage discourtesy". (p.3) Another, more positive view comes from Elisabeth B Custer. She has had many close encounters with Indians and their society and shows a lot of interest in the Indian culture. However in her text, negative attitudes are also revealed in the words used to name the Indians. She calls them creatures and savages in a way that makes you understand that those are terms normally used, but they still are words that have negative and demeaning content. They reflect the attitude of whites in general rather than her own opinions. Her fascination is apparent when she describes the Indians clothes and appearance. "The costume was simply superb." (p.23) "The Indians feet are usually very small; sometimes their vanity induces them to put on women's shoes. The hands are slender and marvellously soft considering their life exposure. Their speech is full of gesture, and the flexible wrist makes their movements expressive." (p26.) When she describes the Indians and their ways her observations are always detailed, personal and focus on the emotions of the Indians. "The Indian kiss is not demonstrative; the lips are laid softly on the cheek and no sound is heard or motion made. It was only this grave occasion that induced the chief to show such feelings." (p.24) "No fear showed itself, but from the characteristically stolid face hate and revenge flashed out for an instant." (p.21) "the warrior understood the unusual sight of a smile from his people." "The orator saw that the faces of the Indians showed signs of humor." (p.27) "The prisoner dropped his head to hide the look in his eyes that he thought ill became a warrior as brave as he really was. The bitter, revengeful thoughts with witch I had entered the room were for a moment forgotten and I almost wished that he might be pardoned." "the suffering among the Indians was very great." (p.26) "The Indians all seemed a melancholy people." (p.31) These last quotes show that she has sympathy for the Indians. One par of eyes we see the Indians through are the ones of Graham. His texts are from the 1950s but it contains an interview from 1877. He has perspective on the conflicts between Indians and whites and he writes much more about how the Indians have been mistreated, which has become more common as time has gone by. "those who had already bowed their necks to the white man's yoke had been cheated abused and made captives de facto whatever may have been their status de jure." (p.10) He also acknowledges it here: To Moon was brave enough he says, but a great liar, who held that it was not wrong to lie to the white men, In view of the white man's record of mendacity when dealing with Indians, the old chief had something there!" (p.9) He does not agree with the old terms used to describe Indians and Indian related matters. "The so-called hostile camp" (p.10) One thing that is different in this text compared to Walkers, is that there is more interest in the Indians story and their side of the conflict. Now, lets move on to the interview I mentioned. In order to get an interview with Sitting Bull, a Major named Walsh told him that the news reporter was a "great paper chief who talked with a million tongs to all the people in the world... This is a man of wonderful medicine; he speaks and the people on this side and across the great water open their ears and hear him." (p.11). It shows that they try to imitate the Indians way of speaking and reasoning to reach an agreement. The news reporter has a lot of respect for the Indian Chief. "After gracefully shaking hands ... I bade him adieu." (p.19) "He leaned back and resumed his attitude and expression of barbaric grandeur." (p.14) As I stated the attitudes towards Indians vary a lot. This depends on by whom and when they are expressed. A dominating opinion is that they are violent. Otherwise the views span from aversion to annoyance to fascination and respect. A visible tendency is that the distance to Indians changes to interest in them, as time progresses.
EE591	0	﻿I think I am quite fluent in English. If a conversation is going on, the fact that that is the language in which it is being held certainly does not keep me from entering it - regardless whether it's a large number of people in the discussion or only a few. Nor does it impose any serious restrictions on what nuances I can express, even though of course I am not as exact in them as when I use my maternal language. What does bother me, though, is my accent. All too often I hear myself sounding like a "Swedish politician", which is not exactly my idea of the perfect accent. Especially when I give speeches (which, by the way, makes me very nervous, but that does not have very much to do with my English, as I have the same problem using Swedish), this detestable accent creeps up. Definitely something to work on during the self-labs... Writing, naturally, does not bring this problem of accent, but here instead I get the related problem of style. As you already may have noticed, I tend to get a bit verbose, and mix different levels of formality - faults not too uncommon, I guess. This shows when I try to write formal letters and realize that I have used far too informal language. Generally, both in speaking and writing, I often mix British and American ways of expression, which is something I would like to avoid as far as possible, or at least avoid mixing distinctively American and British phrases. In writing, as well as anywhere else, I would like to extend my vocabulary, make it more varied yet still natural. Reading, on the other hand, I do quite badly. Not only do I read English at merely half my "normal" speed, but worse is that I do not penetrate the text as deeply as I do with Swedish. This probably has to do with my relatively small practise of reading fiction in English, and will hopefully be a lot better after this term. Fortunately this does not mean I don't understand what the text says, but rather that I don't see what is going on below the surface in the same way as I do with Swedish texts. Not that I haven't read much of English text, but most of the reading I do is actually non-fiction, which doesn't require any deeper penetration of the text and it's style. And finally, let's say something about my listening abilities. As a matter of fact, the only native English-speaking environment I have visited, is south Wales, where I stayed in a family for a couple of weeks. Their accent is not the most clear and easiest to understand, I think you can agree with me on that. Thus I didn't understand a word of what they said when they were talking to each other, though when they wanted me to understand they let go of all that Welsh they mixed into their English, and suddenly understanding was as easy as anything! It's a pity I don't understand odd accents, but when does one even get to hear them? But since this is my only experience of an English-speaking society, nearly all my "live" experience of spoken English comes from communicating with non-native speakers, or teachers at school (I went to the Stockholm Secondary School of Music, which also gives International Baccalaureates and has programmes taught in English, though I took all subjects in Swedish, except for mathematics). But what I really like listening to, is BBC Radio. Here one can find accents and voices worth listening to, just for the sake of themselves! Well, I think this was all I wanted to say about my English, give or take half of the text. I hope it shows at least soemthing about where my strengths and weaknesses are, and what of them I see as most interesting to improve. Though what I wanted to say may be covered in a great deal of drivel.$$$﻿ Girls and boys in separate classes? During the last couple of years there have been discussions concerning separate classes for boys and girls in junior high school. This means that there would be one class for girls and one class for boys at each level. Despite this separation they will work according to the same curriculum and have the same subjects. Is this a good or a bad idea? Will this give them a true picture of what today's society look like? I believe that separate classes take away many important things from the students. One of these things is different experiences and with that I mean different ways of looking at things. Boys and girls have various experiences due to the way they have been brought up and the way they have been treated by the people around them. Some children have good memories and some have bad memories but the thing is that the memories, or experiences, are not the same. Why is this so important then? Well, I believe that this divergence gives the lessons a bit of nuance. Boys and girls can contribute with their own views and thoughts, their own peculiarities. The teacher can use these differences during the lessons as examples or maybe as a good basis in a class discussion where the students learn that there are differences between boys and girls but they also learn that they are all equally important in the classroom and also in our society. For many years we have been striving for an equal society and we are on our way towards this goal. To join in on this journey you have to be able to co-operate with both males and females without any prejudice. Do you think this is possible if you have been attending a school in which boys and girls are separated thus taking away your chances to learn how to function in a situation which requires that kind of social competence? I would not think so. I think that a school like this teaches the students that it is right to separate girls from boys, that there are differences between the sexes in the way they learn things. Maybe the students get the idea that, for example, boys are better than girls, that this is the reason why they are separated. Thoughts like these would only take us back in time and not forward towards the equal society that we are working so hard to achieve. So why do some people advocate for this separation? They say that there are a lot of advantages with this kind of class. We all know that boys and girls are not the same. There is no point in denying that. The spokesman for this type of school says that the students are given more time to develop and find themselves. The boys do not have to "show off" in front of the girls. Instead they can put all of their time and effort into the schoolwork. The girls are also looked upon as winners in this system. They do not have to compete with the boys for the teacher's attention and they are given more room. What I have to say about the arguments for this kind of school is that I do not believe all of them. You develop into one person in the all-girls class and then, when you go out into the society, you have to change into another person who can work with both sexes. And who says that a little competition between boys and girls is bad? I believe that competition is necessary for everyone in order to turn them into strong human beings. If I were to give my opinion today on this question about separate classes for boys and girls at junior high school I would be against it. I feel that mixed classes have more to offer and teach students. They give them the opportunity to learn how to co-operate with people of the opposite sex. There is also a competition in the mixed classes that encourages students to develop and improve themselves and that is what school is all about, I believe.
EE590	0	﻿At the age of 20, I now look back at my English studies and it seems unreal that ten years have gone by since I was in the 4th grade, which was my first year of English. I can still remember how we sang "John Brown" and practiced the colors by writing a book. Everybody also had to choose a name from an English speaking country. Most of my classmates had a name from the American soap opera "Dallas", such as Pamela, Bobby, and Jenna. I was called Patricia, a name, which my mom came up with. These are my first memories from studying English. In elementary school, English was more a game than a subject and I loved it. In middle school I started with German and I felt that my English was neglected, which really worried me. German was hard but very logical and I knew and understood the grammar. I could tell the German prepositions in my sleep, whereas I did not know anything about the English prepositions. After middle school I began to dream of a school year abroad. I made up my mind as I started high school, not only because I was worried about my English skills, but also because I longed for adventure. Thanks to my parents this dream became true in 1996. After my second year of high school I left for Indiana, U.S.A. My question for this paper is: what have I learned during these ten years of studying English? Which are my strengths and weaknesses in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing? As a result of my school year in the U.S. my ears have become very familiar with the sound of the English language at an everyday level, especially American English. My time abroad forced me to really listen and pay attention to what people said. Since everything was in English I learned just by living there. I do not have a problem understanding spoken English at an everyday level, but I am very aware of the differences in levels and I know that I still have a long way to go. When it comes to reading the school in Sweden spent quite some time on that, at least at the high school level. Studying in the U.S.A. I also had to do a lot of reading, which I sometimes found difficult, especially in classes such as government and economics, since there were so many terms that I was not familiar with. I do fine reading novels and I have learned to use the context when there are words that I do not know. I enjoy reading novels in English, but I find it harder to understand shorter texts. Perhaps I need more information to really get it. A time limit stresses me and I tend to read too fast; that is probably why I have a problem with short stories, and I never did as good as I wanted to on reading and comprehension tests in high school. Due to my time in the U.S.A. with the Americans my spoken English developed tremendously. I did not realize how much my school English had changed until my sisters came to see me; I had then been in the U.S.A. for one semester. Listening to their English I understood that my English had been given an American touch. I learned to use new words and speak although I was not sure that it was correct. I came to the point where I allowed myself to make mistakes and I let people laugh at me. Sometimes my tongue really got twisted and I said the craziest things, yet my mistakes taught me more than I would ever have learned if I had been quiet. Speaking English sometimes makes me nervous, and in a strange way I feel more relaxed speaking English with, or in front of, English native speakers than I do with my countrymen. Writing is the skill in which I have not had very much practice, not even in the U.S.A. since the tests were always made up of matching or multiple choice questions. My third, and last, year of high school in Sweden I took a class called "English C" and there we actually practiced writing. We wrote formal letters, personal notes, leaflets, and book reviews. I get a lot of practice by my own since I have so many friends in the U.S.A. to whom I frequently write letters and e-mail messages. A big problem that I have when I write is that I neither feel comfortable with my spelling, nor my grammar. In other words: I really need more writing exercises. Finally, I want to point out that I have learned a lot during these ten years but still ten years is a long time and I feel that I could have learned more than I did. My year in the U.S.A. has given my English an American touch and it also gave me the willingness to study English at the university. I can listen, read, speak, and write English at an everyday level. I can survive and live a normal life in an English speaking country. However, I want more that that and I know that the way is long!$$$﻿ NUCLEAR POWER vs. NATURAL SOURCES OF POWER. The ongoing debate, on nuclear power vs. natural sources of power has never been such a burning issue as today. This question concerns all of us and it is our responsibility to raise people's awareness of this topic. Is nuclear power really the only and the safest way to get power (electricity) to the homes and industries of Sweden? Should we, in the 21th century rely on such an insecure source of power? Are we ready to risk our children's life getting electricity? Are the Swedish nuclear power stations really as secure as we are told? While presenting the pros and cons of different sources of power, I will state my side in the debate and try to answer these burning questions. In this essay I will argue against the use of nuclear power, in all-current methods of using. It might have been the best alternative at the time it was introduced, and voted for, but today we have developed more modern and environment-friendly ways of providing for Sweden's, and other countries, need for electricity. We are told that nuclear power is the most safe, cheap and reliable way of keeping Sweden running. But is it really so? If you see to the side effects, nuclear power is very much a defective source of power. First of all, nuclear fission in itself is a very insecure and inadequate method of gaining power (electricity); every single fission is indeed an uncontrolled explosion. For example, a computer programmer agency got commissioned to investigate the weaknesses of the safety system at a nuclear power station in Sweden and after some research they came up with some five-hundred different situations were the safety system would be inadequate and brake down. Secondly, there is the contaminated nuclear waste to take care of and store for hundreds of years in the bedrock. Everything that has contact with the toxic waste must be stored and kept safe form leakage. The thought of what could happen if the toxic waste got into our ground water or spread in the nature is disastrous, not to mention that the staff working with nuclear waste is at constant risk of nuclear radiation, which is a source of diseases and health problems. Finally, the economic issue is indeed important, and the price of electricity needs to be questioned. Nuclear power is a very expensive way of getting power; nuclear power stations are expensive to built, the Uranium that is most commonly used for nuclear fission is expensive, and you can only use it once. A way of financing this expensive source of power could be for Sweden to raise the price for electricity, as we are one of, not to say the, cheapest country for electric support. With a way of choosing the source from which the electricity to your home came, it is likely that many Swedes would be ready to pay a little more (that means a little more than 0.20-0.50kr/kWh) to be able to dismantle some nuclear power stations. I would, that's for sure, and I'm sure many with me. However, rather than raising electricity prices, an important step would be to investigate our need for electricity. If every sixth Swede turned off one lamp in every room he/she did not use at the moment, we could be able to shut down two of four nuclear reactors at Oskarshamn nuclear power station. The consumers' money could then be used to build up alternative power stations. For as the situation is today, Sweden is not ready to just shut down the nuclear power stations. Our alternatives are not good enough yet. The time of transmission will probably take many years, but the sooner we begin, the sooner we can turn to a totally changed system. Besides considering saving electricity, we need to develop alternative energy sources. Natural sources of power like wind, water and sun, are good alternatives. At first, water power does to some extent disturb the natural balance of a river, but it can naturally never be compared with the destruction that might be caused by nuclear power. The supply of hydroelectric power depends on the annual precipitation - rain or snow, and to be depending on the capricious weather is always a risk, and therefor an argument against the use of hydro power. But it is time introduce the best part of nature power recourses; they are all a complement to each other. That is to say, you need rain to get electricity from water power, but when it doesn't rain, it will, probably and hopefully, be sunshine, which means that we can gain power (and electricity) from the sun, which is indeed an inexhaustible source of power. To just rely on sun power is nothing that we should consider in Sweden, because of the cold and mostly rainy summers, but as a complement, it is both environmentally friendly and costly effective. Wind power is also an inexhaustible source of power. A common argument against the introduction of wind power is that the tall pylons destroy the landscape, but we have to ask ourselves if not that is a reasonable price compared to the shape and condition the landscape would be in if there were a nuclear power station brake down. Moreover, none of those natural sources of power; water, sun and wind, is one by one an alternative to nuclear power, but if we complemented, and developed, all those three together, would more or less cover the energy that we today gain from nuclear power. To sum up, while we cannot just dismantle all the nuclear reactors at once, we have to gradually decrease the use of nuclear energy. We have to be ready to work and pay for a future without nuclear power stations, even if the work just might be turning off lamps, TV sets, and toasters, knowing that the extra money saved is for building an alternative power future.
EE592	0	﻿ My life, my choice It is forbidden in Swedish law for doctors as well as other people to end a patient's life by purpose. What the patient feels is apparently not important. If someone helps a patient to die he is guilty of manslaughter. It makes no difference if the patient is suffering and wants to die. There is no such thing as "mercy killing" in Swedish law. In this case even pets get better and a more human treatment. If your pet picks up a disease that is impossible or still difficult to cure, you bring him to the vet to give him a shot so the pet falls asleep. It makes me start thinking, why cannot we have the possibility to decide what to do with our own lives. Many people are lying motionless in beds in our hospitals every day, where they are kept alive by machines. Don't you think it is right that a person in that situation, a person who only is waiting to die, should have the opportunity to ask his doctor for a lethal injection? I think the answer is obvious. Who would like to lay there just waiting? If I see myself in this position, I would not be able to think about anything else then the fact that death actually came closer every day. There would be too many things reminding me all the time, when the relatives come to visit with tears in their eyes looking extremely sad. I reckon that a human being who does not feel as if he has no purpose left in life and does not have any dignity left would be able to take his life, with some help by the doctor. Note that no one but the patient should be able to decide such a ting. No relative or close friend shall make the decision. In our society suicide is not accepted, it is immoral. That is one of the reasons that some people are against euthanasia, but I do not think one can compare euthanasia and suicide in a fair way, it is two separate things. I see it as a natural thing to help shortening a painful life in bed. Religious people are often against euthanasia. They claim that life is something God gave us and he is the one who is going to take it back when it is time. But in my opinion that does not make sense. I mean, if God decides when to end my life he has not really given it to me, just lent it. If I receive a gift from someone, I decide what to do with it and if I borrow something from someone may I not say thank you and return it whenever I want to? The persons who are in the situation where euthanasia is needed are often not able to commit suicide on their own. (In practical terms) By this I do not mean that only those persons should have the rights to do this. Everyone who has some kind of incurable disease where the treatment is incredible painful should have the right to decide what to do with his life. Cancer, AIDS or any other lethal disease, it makes no difference. Because of the prohibition of euthanasia, the patients still get drugged but not by the purpose to help them die, even though the doctors are aware that it could lead to that. All that sneaking to avoid the rules could be stopped if we changed the law and active euthanasia possible to choose. Make the active euthanasia legal to make the dying people less suffering!$$$﻿ English, My English! Introduction: I must say that I am a little confused, having to evaluate my own English. There have been times when I have been (according to myself, that is) very good at it, speaking and writing mostly. And other times when my self confidence has been very bad. Nowadays I see myself somewhere in between extremely good and not so good at all. There are, in English, things I enjoy more though, thus I am better at it. y knowledge of English dates back to when I was six-seven years old and learned how to count to ten in English. Very soon I advanced to counting to one hundred, and eventually, my interest for the language increased. Result: I will structure my work in the way the task was given; comparing skills of reading, writing, speaking and listening. I will also write about the relation between enjoying something and being good at it. Roughly, I can divide the four areas into Reading and Listening as one thing and Writing and Speaking as another. This division is made only after what I find fun within a language, and what I don't. Writing: Usually, I am quite an impatient person. There are exceptions though. Like writing for ex. When I write, it can be essays, letters, made up stories or what ever, I go so much into it that I almost forget about time. I suddenly change from being a person with no patience at all, to this very ambitious writer, eager to learn more. I look up new words in dictionaries to get synonyms of my old repeated vocabulary, I usually spend a lot of time working out sly and clever conclusions and I put down much work to make it appear as a fine piece of work written by someone very intelligent. A weakness in my writing is connected to reading. I simply don't read enough. My best essays have been ones that I have more or less figured out myself, with my common sense and logical reasoning. I just hate ploughing my way through some book even though it might be a great source for me to use. Anyway, I am getting better at that too. After I have realised that my writing could be so much better, I am trying my utmost to go through sources about a subject before writing my own ideas about it. Nevertheless, this essay ought to be a favourite task for me, since the only source I have is myself. Reading: As I mentioned above, I have a slight difficulty concentrating on a text for a longer time. Especially if I don't find anything of interest in the novel or article, or whatever it is, that I am reading. I can get so bored that my eyes just move and my brain is left to do whatever it fancies for the moment. It is not only the subject of a text that can bore me to death. Also, if I don't understand the words in a text I have difficulties to go on reading. Not understanding the vocabulary makes me feel ignorant and, more or less, left out. As if I was not supposed to be within the target group. Even though it might be silly, I feel a bit ashamed and actually insulted. In spite of this highly "defensive" attitude of mine I understand that it is self-evident not knowing all words in a language I was not even born speak. After just having read the 400 page book "Nice Work" by David Lodge I notice that I feel much more updated on my English. Without even noticing it, the language gets stuck in your brain. Reading is probably the most efficient way to get to know a language, as a first step, and then in combination with speaking, listening and writing. Speaking: To speak is one of my stronger sides in the matter of English. Mostly because it's fun, and it is used in many natural situation. When you go to a English speaking country, you need to know how to communicate, and speaking is the simplest way to do that. I find it fun in the same way as I enjoy writing. I myself is the one producing something, and I am allowed to experiment with my language. I can try new words and expressions and hopefully there will be some kind of feedback, that I can interpret and through that realise if I have said something wrongly and ought to keep my mouth shut, or if the listener actually bought what I had to say. If the latter is the fact, then I can go on using that certain word. When speaking, I pretty much talk over my own head. I use words that I am not even sure the meaning of. But I believe that that is my own way of improving my English, and I have no intention of starting to write and speak on levels that are below the one that I am actually on. Speaking and writing is fun because I am the one saying things, but it can also be of use when discussing and analyse information you have obtained by reading and listening. The area of speaking also includes pronunciation, and I can only say that I have never ever had any troubles with it. I guess that is something that you're born with, since I have no difficulties to pronounce French or imitate dialects. Listening: The talent of listening is also quite related to ones interest of the subject. Again, if something appears not to be interesting to me, I might not even try to listen, and that makes it hard to be comprehensive about the context. But mostly, when I take part in a conversation, I understand the most of it. Then there is a clear difference in vocabulary used if two young people are chatting about nothing of greater importance, than if for ex. Tony Blair is giving a political speech. Then there might be many words that go beyond my understanding, but I can still, hopefully, understand the main issue. What can be even more difficult to understand than politics or "business talk" is a conversation between two native English people who use their own slang and a, for me, strange dialect. Concerning my studies here at the university, I have no problems in understanding what is said on lectures. Even though I guess that the language is being adjusted to an agreeable level. Conclusions: After being forced to evaluate my own English, I have found out the following: y strengths in English lie in the areas of speaking and writing. This is mostly because I enjoy it more, and therefor it is practised more frequently. I realise that when I try to fool others that my essays are good by using difficult words and as many "new" expressions possible, still trying to make the text credible, I am not fooling anyone else than myself. The thing is that the essays I try to make look good, actually must be good. When putting down so much work in trying to improve the text, vocabulary and content, I practice without really being aware of it. Since they are the main components in a text: content and language, there couldn't be so much more to it, right?
EE353	1	﻿ Abortion - a question of human freedom To have the freedom to decide for your self, over your own body and life. Not all people have the "right" to do so. This is depending on where you live and/or what religion you belong to. Unfortunately this leads to people having abortions illegally, or in some cases they give birth to the baby and then abandon it. All people must have the right to chose for them self if they should have an abortion or not. Though it should be under control and not be used as a contraceptive. Abortion is not accepted all over the world. In the United States of America there have been wild discussions between Republicans and Democrats if abortion should be allowed or not ( right now it is allowed in the States). I think it is a human right to decide over your own life, if you want to have the baby or not. There should be no such thing as becoming pregnant and then have an abortion just because you do not care about using some kind of protection. But accidents happen; some see it as a great opportunity to keep the baby with the excuse it just happened. But there are also those who do not want a baby, are unable to care for a child, feel that there is not enough money to give the child a proper life. Most important though is that both persons involved agree on whatever decision they make. Here in Sweden we are lucky that it is fairly accepted and legal to have an abortion. It provides a freedom to the people, especially women. Lately there have been, in Sweden, many women who have an abortion because of their economic situation. Of course that is a very important aspect, it is very important to know that you are able to give the baby the support it needs. No one should be forced to bring a baby to the world if they feel they are not able to take care of it. Abortion can help a lot of people. Pregnancy, as I mentioned above, is not always planned. You really have to consider the consequences, taking the responsibility. If it was not legal to have an abortion there would be many cases of illegal abortion, and also unwanted children brought to life. No child should be brought to the world "without" parents. There have to be an agreement between the two, no woman should be forced to have a baby if she really don't want to, but she can't neither force the man to support the child if he really don't want to have a baby. There are not only these things as mentioned above that can be the reason for wanting to have an abortion. Today we have modern medical equipment that makes it easier to, in a rather early stage, examine the foetus and discover if there are any problems. Some babies are born with major heart failures, CP-injuries etc. Many of these problems we have medicines and equipment to handle. Though sometimes some are more serious than other, some incurable. In these cases parents also have a good opportunity to choose if they want to keep the baby. As mentioned, abortion is not legal everywhere. There are many countries that according to law it is forbidden to have an abortion and in many religions too. Even though you are carrying the baby of a rapist... Some people consider it murder to have an abortion. I would say it is not murder but common sense. In many parts of the world we have overpopulation, which is not always due to restrictions about abortion. But I think it can be more regulated if abortion was allowed in some countries. Unfortunately, as mentioned, it happens that women accidentally become pregnant. Although we have so many different kinds of protections to chose from. Abortions should of course never be considered as a contraceptive, but has to be accepted to help out in certain situations. Finally, abortion should be something that every person, all over the world, should be able to consider. No matter what country or religion, there always have to be the possibility to control your own life. There should be no children brought to the world "without" parents.$$$﻿ The entertaining and persuasive television Television serves as a good entertainment form. Unfortunately it sometimes might not be that good for us since it can affect our health. We use the television for many good purposes, to spread news, educate, inform and amuse people. But there is also the abuse of television e.g. in programs where they try to fob on things on people. I think television is useful, there are just as many interesting programs as there are junk programs. The news programs are always very interesting, there are also many other interesting programs. But as mentioned above, there's a lot of junk. All these soapopra's, docusoap's, Ricky Lake talk shows (those where people discuss their problems with their loved ones and lovers etc.). I think these programs are so pathetic. All these desperate people, they seem to do almost anything to be on television. Lately there have popped up so many new talk shows and docusoap's etc. I think it is starting to get crowded among these kinds of programs but some people like watching them and of course there has to be a program for everyone. Today people watch much more television than some years ago. People exercise less nowadays. If you have been working all day or been in school many prefer to sit down in front of the television set when they are tired instead of going out exercising. And with all the series on television some get addicted. Of course I can understand people getting addicted to some series, I have also been there. This extended watching of television has had effects on people. In our society people are growing fatter, of course what we eat matters, but also the combination of watching too much television and not exercising enough can have negative effects. Mentally you can get affected from what you watch on television, not all people are affected but it happens. Though as mentioned earlier it is a good form of entertainment, because there is a lot to choose from, I think there is something for everyone (even dogs, my dog loves watching TV). When it comes to education, television has a lot to provide. News programs are of course very educational. But there are a lot of other programs with educational purposes, there are the children's programs which can be both educational and entertaining. There are different kinds of programs where you can learn and practise a language, how to do woodwork or cooking. Cooking, has become very popular on television over the past years. They have a lot of recipes and suggestions on dinner. This is very useful if you are out of ideas on what to eat or simply are not that good in cooking. A couple of years ago the commercials entered Swedish television. The Swedish channels 1 and 2 would not accept the commercials but TV4 and some other Swedish channels did. I liked the commercials in the beginning but nowadays I get annoyed when watching a movie and there is a commercial break every twenty minutes, though some might be fun but it gets repetitive when they run the same commercials over and over again. We use television mostly for good purposes but there is also an abuse of television. I think the abuse of television is when someone is trying to fool people to buy something as in commercials but particularly in TV shop. These programs, where they show e.g. a belt that will give you a muscular stomach in only one week. Everybody should be informed that it doesn't work that way. It takes at least six months. This is really abuse of television, actors are often used (probably to make it more convincing) to tell how wonderful this product is. Anyway the point is that many things they want people to buy are often just crap. This is abuse of television. Neil Postman writes in Amusing Ourselves to Death: "Television, as I have implied earlier, serves us most usefully when presenting junk entertainment; it serves us most ill when it co-opts serious modes of discourse-news, politics, science, education, commerce, religion-and turns them into entertainment packages. We would all be better off if television got worse, not better." There are many ways to judge television and all the different programs. There is a point to what Neil Postman writes but everyone has their own opinion on what is good entertainment and how it should be formed. Maybe that is why we have such a wide range on programs, so everyone will be pleased.
EE198	0	﻿I've always been interested in different sorts of languages, but I think that english is the language that has been the most fun during my years in school. I must also say that all the teachers that I've had, have affected me in a very positive way. That might be the big reason to why I want to become an english teacher. I've always had enjoyable english lessons and I want my students to get the same experience as I've got. When I think of it, I don't think it is mainly the teachers that has affected me, wanting to learn some more about the language and how to use it. Through the years I've done some travelling, and I think its the excitement in wanting to get to know other people and cultures that has made me curious. Also when I look at all the yars that has passed, I find myself among all the other students, sitting listening to a lecture as it has been on swedish. I mean...its just such a feeling to know that the brain or whatever there is inside, can just switch from one langage to the other and we still respond in the same way. Maybe it sounds a bit fussy in the way I describe my feeling about it, but I think, or at least hope, that I have made myself understandable. That is by the way one of the things that I want to develop about myself. The way in how to make the right expressions. I think it is hard to find the right words when I'm talking, I often put myself in a position when I just simply loose the words. The thing is that it doesn't have to be very hard words, and that both annoys me at the same time as it makes me very frustrated because I feel in a way that I can't make myself heard in the way that I want to. Also I sometimes find myself a bit insecure wether I should make a point of view or not when I think something is wrong, just because I'm afraid that I can't find the words. Don't get me wrong when I say this, because I don't look at myself as a shy person. But maybe the explanation about this can be that It's easier to get into a new language just to listen, than to begin to speak. In one way I think that I learn something new everytime I speak english with someone else, but also everytime I go to a lecture or an english lesson. There's always a couple of words that are new to my ears. One of the best things that I've done, was to live in an english environment, where I was more or less forced to speak english every day, (if I didn't set up a meeting with a couple of my swedish friends of course). Then what did I do? Well, like many swedish girls do, I went abroad as an au pair. I fell for an advert in a swedish newspaper. And just for fun I answered it without expecting to get any response. Anyway, a couple of weeks after the family had responded, I found myself sitting in an aeroplane, heading for London, to where I had never been before. My stay in this wonderful city ended for six months, and I learned a lot about myself, english people, the culture and of course a lot about the language. This was a couple of yars ago, but since I was there I have tried more or less to keep the english langage alive with reading english books, newspapers and magazines, something which is very good practise. I've never had so much difficulties when it comes to writing, and I find grammar quite fun, but that is always something that I have to "dust off a bit". Nowadays we get so much free through all television, (and soap-operas unfortunately...) but I can't say anything bad about it, because when we live in such a country as we do, we have to get to know at least one more language to communicate with, and then I find english to be the most important, as it is spoken all over the world.$$$﻿Reader, my reader! I wish to invite you to follow my thoughts, when I try to put something down about the English language. I have studied this language for nine years, and now I have come to a point in my life, when I for different reasons have to ask myself: "How competent do I feel about my English?" The first thought that turns up to answer this question, is that I feel a lot more confident in reading and listening, than I do in writing and talking. (Even after second thoughts, I am sure that this is a correct and comprehensive answer.) To answer the follow up questions: "Why is this so?" and "Exactly what is it that makes me feel unconfident in talking and writing?" I now decide to make an assessment of my weaknesses and strengths in these four communicative skills. A good thing that will hopefully come out of this analysis, is that it might help me achieve a personal goal set up for this spring. The goal is simply to improve my English as much as possible. The analysis might be helpful, as I do not really know what is wrong; only that I often stumble when I speak, and that I apparently have overestimated my grammar skills. (The latter struck me when I got back a grammar test the other day.) I start with my most untrained skill - talking. Two things that I am aware of, and that I would like to change, are that I use a lot of "Swenglish" expressions, and that I often speak in a stumbling and monotonous mode. The first thing is a linguistic problem, and the second is a matter of fluency. (If you speak fluently, then by definition you do not stumble and then you may feel secure enough to speak in a more melodic way.) I have found out that my main linguistic problems are two: my sentence construction, which is influenced by my way of expressioning myself in Swedish, and pronunciation of certain sounds and words, especially the sounding s, which I often leave unsounded. I have also found two main problems concerning fluency. The first is my active vocabulary; I understand a lot of words when I read, which would never occur to me while talking. The second problem is the pronunciation of certain sounds meeting each other where two words meet, e.g. Changed to, catch the, realised that this etc. After these insights, I go on to the skill of writing. There are much of the same problems in my writing as in my speech. Word order is an example. All errors I ever do in writing, I most certainly even do in talking, although the reverse may not hold. The problem with active and passive vocabulary is not so serious when I write, because I then have a chance to look for words in a dictionary (a fact which should be immensely manifested in this survey of somewhat introspective thoughts). I am happy to say that I have also found a strength in my writing, namely spelling. I wish to conclude my assessment of the two extrovert skills by noting another problem that is present in my writing as well as in my speech: choosing the appropriate word. The difficulty is to feel the spirit of the word. In Swedish I have a very clear idea of how different synonyms are apprehended (or at least of how I apprehend them myself), e.g. if a word or a phrase sounds comic, sarcastic, snobbish, silly, childish, ambiguous, scientific, boring, negative, positive, demanding, romantic, poetic etc. But in English I have a very faint idea of such things, especially since I do not know many synonyms. Maybe this is evident in this essay, where I, on purpose, try to use a formal and a bit intricate way of writing; more advanced than I would normally write. However, I cannot decide whether it rather sounds affected. I now go on to list listening skills. I have no difficulties in following lectures, but it is a bit harder to understand a movie or, even worse, a song in English. How much I understand depends very much on the speed, the subject, the dialect etc. Proceeding to reading, this analysis draws to an end, since I can happily say that I have no problems in reading English, maybe except for some unknown words that might appear. So, finally I come to the conclusion that I should put most effort in writing and talking. Unfortunately this means that I have to offer part of the attention I pay to the great thoughts of authors and teachers, in favour of the expression of my own primitive single-tracked thoughts about food, sleep and the propagation of human race.
EE351	1	﻿ Raise the teachers' salaries! It is common known that today's Sweden, to a great extent, lacks qualified teachers. All too few teachers are being educated, and many who are certificated teachers choose to work elsewhere than in school. This should not be a surprise though, as both their status and salaries are low in comparison with other academics. If you in addition to this, consider how rough the teachers' working conditions are today, it is obvious that something has to be done to change their situation. It is absolutely necessary to raise the teachers' wages, in order to give them a salary that corresponds with their assignments, and make the profession attractive again. But is it then so hard to be a teacher? I claim that it is, and in this essay I'm going to try to convince you, that the teachers' salaries are much too low in addition to their contemporary working conditions. The teaching profession has always been demanding. Teachers have always been expected to do a lot of extra work that not has been included in their scheduled working hours; lessons have had to be prepared and written tests and essays corrected. And today the working burden has become even heavier. A teacher's job is not any more only to make sure that its pupils pass their examinations and keep calm in class. Humanity and individualism have become a part of the Swedish schools, and even though this of course is positive, it has increased the pressure on the teachers. Today, evaluation of the individual pupil's development and progress is a part of the learning process. The teacher has to organize conversations between teacher, parents and child regularly. This is not only taking a lot of the teacher's time with a lot of planning required and meetings have to be taken place in the evenings, but the closer contact with the parents also puts psychological pressure on the teacher. It is supposed to make all parts comfortable in the delicate situations that can arise when children's skills are being discussed. However, the teacher's role as a psychologist doesn't stop at these specific situations. In its daily work, the teacher are supposed to catch all pupils' interest at the same time, and be able to handle all their different needs. Many pupils require extra attention and help and make this a difficult task. The teacher feels that it is not enough. Assisting teachers for pupils with special needs are rare and the teacher can't be there for everybody all the time. In a time when the classes are growing bigger this is getting even harder. Politicians seem to think that teachers are magicians. With less money, fewer lessons and more students, they are supposed to be doing miracles and reach a higher ambition level. The teachers' responsibilities do not either end with education in the form of school subjects as math and English. The teacher is an adult with whom the pupils spend their whole day, to which the small children look up to and imitate. It becomes a part of its students' upbringing, whether it likes it or not. The school is a social community, where children learn to act among other people than their family. And the school of today is not an easy world to live in. The teacher is supposed to guide the pupils through the jungle of social and emotional problems that can arise in school. It is supposed to discover if a child is feeling bad, if it is being treated badly in school or at home. The lack of welfare officers makes this task even harder. But it is not only a question of children being treated badly and feeling bad at school. Today the school is not a safe place to be, for teachers as well as for pupils. An increasing number of students bear guns and bully their teachers. In many schools the pupils are "taking over the classrooms" and teachers are afraid of going to their jobs. As you can see the teachers' working conditions are hard. They are supposed to act both as mentors and psychologists, but do only get paid for teaching. They have great responsibilities and it is time that they are being rewarded for that. They must feel that they are appreciated, so that they will have the strength to improve the Swedish schools. It is time that we invest in the teachers and raise their salaries, before we do not have any left. An investment in our teachers is an investment in our children, and thus an investment in our future.$$$﻿ Entertainment Television - Good or Bad? Television is now a part of almost everyone's daily life. It has existed for more than fifty years and most of us cannot imagine life without it. But still the role TV plays in society is being wildly discussed, and especially its function as an entertainer. In this essay I am going to reflect upon TV entertainment, what is good and bad about it and what part it plays in our lives. People watch a lot of TV just to be entertained. There are soap operas, talk shows, comedy series, docu-soaps, game shows and movies. TV can take you to different times and places you otherwise only can reach in your imagination or it can just make you laugh. But this kind of entertainment is not really considered to be a good way to amuse yourself. That is especially the case when it comes to junk-entertainment as soap operas and talk shows. Society condemns people who watch these programmes, although a huge part of the population in industrialized countries do watch them. Even though you are being entertained, entertainment TV is seen as a waste of time. But who can decide what is a waste for every individual and how much watching that is too much? Of course it is not good for your health to lay in front of the TV all day, but besides the health factor I personally think it is up to every single person to decide how much TV-watching that is too much. There are people who get addicted to soap operas and of course then it has gone out of hand, then it is not entertainment anymore then it is a must, but that does not make soap operas a bad thing in general. The important thing is in my opinion that you feel comfortable with your watching. Entertainment is never a waste; entertainment makes life worth living. No one knows why we live on this earth but entertainment surely makes life more fun. But although entertainment TV is amusing there are unfortunately some negative aspects of it. Soap operas are filled with beautiful people who live glamorous lives, in music videos the looks are nowadays almost as important as the music, and beauty pageants like "Miss Universe" make little girls believe that you have to be at least 1,75 meters tall to be beautiful. Although entertainment TV does not exactly reduce the fixation on looks, it is not its fault that we have this view on the human being. Beauty is what people want to see and that is what they get. Entertainment TV reflects this way our culture. And although television is not really accepted as "culture" in the same way as theater or literature, of course it today is a part of our culture. The TV has a given place in our homes and those who do not have one are actually seen as a bit peculiar. The fact is that it is hard to follow the public debate and act in society today without any knowledge of what is on TV at the moment. Many programmes have even become tradition. A good example in Sweden is the animated show "Kalle Ankas Jul" on Christmas Eve. For many Swedes this show is almost as important as Christmas presents. TV programmes can sometimes also be even more important to the viewers than that; many long-running TV series have for example their own fan clubs. An example of such a series is the drama series "The Prisoner", which is about the life of women prisoners at an Australian prison. However I believe that the importance of TV is changing because of the new world of computers and other advanced technology. Children play computer games or surf on the Internet instead of watching TV, and a lot of information that TV provides can today be found on the Internet. You can for example watch the participants in docu-soaps as for instant "Baren", telecast by the Swedish channel TV3, throughout the twenty-four hours. I think that TV will, for a long time yet, play an important part as an entertainer, but that it will develop in other directions than now, the docu-soaps is an example of that. We can just wait and see what TV and its entertainment section will have to offer in the future, and see or watch I think is just what the whole world will.
EE516	0	﻿ Sweden, just say No to the EU! In this essay I will present two of the main reasons why Sweden ought to leave the European Union. There are, as I see it, more reasons than those two that I'm going to deal with. But I'll concentrate on the two that I've considered to be the most important. Namely that, first of all the EU isn't a democratic union and second of all the countries that are supposed to work together have to little in common for them to be able to work effectively with governing the union. Both reasons are strong reasons not to continue being part of the union although the first is the strongest reason you could ever think of. The threats against democracy today are many, not all of them having to do with right winged fanatics with shaved heads and kickerboots. No, I believe that the biggest threat today is the EU. Because, if we examine the word, democracy stands for government by the people and/or social equality. Now people may say a lot of good things about the EU but it is not governed by the people although I might go so far as to say that when it comes to social equality, no country that I know of has ever been equal in every sense of the word. Therefor I will not complain about the EU not being equal. I will instead concentrate on the government by the people part. The EU today is a maze of red tape and do not enter signs, how will the public ever get an insight into the decisions if the people running the EU continue trying to keep much of what they do as secret as possible. For example, when an official in the EU leaked information to the newspapers about corruption in the European parliament. The people he worked for didn't exactly congratulate him on being so honest, no, they demoted him, he got a job as a cleaner in the European parliament, needless to say he soon thereafter quit his job. When this question was debated many argued that the decision to replace him was the right one, because he had gone to the press and not to the parliament. He went to the people living in the EU and not to the people who ruled the EU because he felt that the people had a right to know first. That is illegal. But so is, I fell, corruption. Therefor, I fell, he should have been rewarded not demoted in the way that he was. This is a very frightening example, and I would believe it scares a lot of people working in the European parliament and a lot of people living in the EU. I mean who wants to start sweeping floors just because someone else on his/hers job is being dishonest and he/she can't look the other way? And who wants to be governed by people that demotes honesty? I certainly do not want either of it, and I can't believe that anyone else wants that to happen. Now, some might argue that if you don't like the people making the decisions, you could choose not to vote for them the next time. But if you do not know what is going on in the parliament, How can you decide who is honest and who is not? And if you got demoted for telling the public the truth about some of your colleagues and what they did with the publics money. Who would dare to tell the truth? y second reason why I think Sweden ought to leave the EU is that the counties in the EU has to little in common with each other to be able to work effectively together. I'll try to be as brief as possible when explaining this. I'm not saying that because we have our differences we cannot work together at all in the EU, what I'm trying to say is that we cannot work the way we are doing it now. I mean how can someone who has been living in Spain or Italy all his life fully understand the problems facing the farmers in the north of Sweden or Finland, to take one example. The information they get is from the Swedish/Finnish representatives and they might not know or care enough about the subject to give the full picture. I would have liked to develop that thought further but the essay would become altogether to long if I did so I'll try to wrap this up now. The two reasons I have presented are to me strong reasons for Sweden to leave the EU, but of course I'm not impossible. If the problems that I have addressed are solved then I see no reason for us not to stay in the union, just as long as we don't join the EMU.$$$﻿As a child I would torment my environment, especially my parents, with questions, much as any other youngster. I am very grateful to them all for putting up with me. On discovering that there were in fact more languages out in the world than Swedish, a whole new world of knowledge opened up to me, still unexplored but exciting and tempting. That I primarily turned to English is no surprise, since I had heard it practically daily on radio and television and for some reason the fascination I felt for the English tongue has never faded. But how much do I really know? How well do I master English? In this essay I intend to give my account on what I think I do know in terms of reading, speaking, listening and writing. It was in ninth grade that I first ventured to read an English book in my spare time. It was a science-fiction novel and just to make it through the first page took me half an hour. In time, though, I got sick of looking up every single word I did not fully comprehend and concentrated on understanding the contents of a sentence rather than the individual words. Since then I have continued reading books in English on a regular basis and nowadays it does not take me longer to read an American or British book in its original language than a translation to Swedish. My greatest problem in this area is that my vocabulary is not extensive enough and thus I occasionally still have to be content with understanding a sentence and not strive to know every word. When speaking, I pride myself on my fluency, which is acceptable at least, and that I - to the best of my knowledge - do not make too many grammatical mistakes. However, I do not want to give you a false picture of me as some perfect English speaker. Since English is not my native tongue, I could probably never be. I sometimes stutter, have trouble finding the right words, use strange and old fashioned expressions, et cetera. I am also hopelessly bad at slang and modern phrases. Furthermore, I intend to work on my pronunciation and, hopefully, lose my Swedish accent. I have no real troubles when it comes to listening. This is, after all, the area in which I have had most practise. Since childhood I have been subjected to English in music, on children's programs and in movies. It was inevitable that I would pick up a few phrases here and there. Today, listening comprehension poses no real difficulty. As long as the person I listen to does not have too heavy an accent or slurs his/her words beyond recognition I can normally follow a conversation or lecture. Again, my greatest disadvantage lies in a vocabulary understanding that is too small. Considering the number of words in the English language, though, I could study all my life without learning them all - as could pretty much anyone. But I will make an effort to extend my vocabulary while studying at the English department of the University of Uppsala. We now come to the interesting question of my writing abilities. I would say that, along with my unfamiliarity with grammar terminology, writing is definitely going to be my Achilles heel on this course. My difficulties lie not in composition nor word order (I hope I am not proving myself wrong here). The problem for me is spelling. It is not a great problem, but it is annoying and... slightly embarrassing. Very often I know how to pronounce a word, but find myself unable to spell it. I make quite a few small, silly mistakes. I will try to improve, though. On the positive side, I write in a fluent way that - according to others - does not feel forced. As you might understand, it is very hard for me to judge my own writing in that way, since everything that I have written is very clear to me. So I am afraid that relating to you the opinions of others will have to suffice.
EE468	1	﻿ CHANGE THE AGE LIMIT FOR BUYING ALCOHOL Have you ever thought about, just like I have, why we in Sweden have the odd legislation that people are allowed to buy alcohol in a bar the day they are 18 years old but they have to wait until they are 20 to go to "Systembolaget"? it is very difficult for me to see the reasons why there should not be a change in the law in order to let people from the age of 18 buy alcohol at "Systembolaget". To obtain alcohol is not a problem when you are 18 years old. Almost everyone knows someone who is 20 and, even though it is unlawful to peddle liquor, it is not seen as a big crime if the one you peddle to is over the age of 18. Many of my friends had parents who acted like peddlers after the day their sons and daughters were 18 years old, some of them even before that. The parents did this because they in this way thought they had control over how much their children drank. I also think they tried to tell their children that they trusted them and show them that they, in the eyes of the parents, had came a piece of the way to the life as an adult. Another reason for parents buying alcohol to their children is the fear of illicitly distilled liquor. This is another motive for me to say that the age limit for buying alcohol at "Systembolaget" should be lowered. It is easy to get hold of home distilled liquor and if the youths can not obtain alcohol from "Systembolaget", which most of them prefer even though it is more expensive, they turn to the dangerous illicitly distilled liquor. I return to what I mentioned in the beginning of the essay; that people in the ages between 18 and 20 are permitted to go to a bar and have a drink, but are not allowed to go to the state liquor shop to buy a few beers. I think the main reason to why we have not already got a change in the law is the fear that youths will easier be able to obtain alcohol if the age limit would be lower. This might be true, to get alcohol is already quite easy for many youths. Nevertheless, I do not think a change in the law would make any major differences in the possibilities for the young people to obtain alcohol. Furthermore I do not think that youths will drink more than they do today. Look at France and Great Britain, for example. The age limit for buying alcohol is lower there than in Sweden, but young people do not drink more because of that. Can the reason be that a part of the excitement is taken away when it is legal? In Sweden, the youths tend to take every given possibility to get drunk, partly because it is unlawful. According to one of my friends who just came back from one year as an au pair in the United States is the situation much worse there than here in Sweden. In most states, it is illegal to drink alcohol before you are 21 years old, but many people drink before that age anyway. She says that the sad thing in the United States is that the youths are not sufficiently informed about the dangers that follows alcohol consumption. There are not many countries with so many car accidents involving drunk drivers as there are in the United States. Whereas the opposition argues that the reason for having different age limits in bars and at "Systembolaget" is that the consumption is under control when you are in a bar, the people who want a change in the law maintain that this is not the case. I have asked a few friends and they, just like me, had to admit that you rarely notice a bartender or a guard telling a guest not to drink more because he or she is too drunk. Not only would an age limit lowering for buying alcohol at "Systembolaget" make things easier for the young people between age 18 and 20, it would also make much more sense. I think we have to face the fact that young people will always drink, in Sweden as well as in other countries, even if we legislate against it or not. More information about the dangers may help, but I think that a part of the fun with drinking when you are young is that it is illegal...$$$﻿ TELEVISION IN OUR TIME Even though it is not more than fifty years ago since the television was officially introduced in Sweden, it is, for many people, impossible to imagine life without their television set. Since I, here in Uppsala, have not got any television set I have during the last few months thought much about whether it is important to own one or not. The introduction of television in our homes made remarkable changes in our lives and today, according to statistics, an average Swedish person spends approximately seven years of his or her life watching television. One can wonder what I do with all time gained when not having a television set. Unfortunately, the time is not spent for any good purposes. While I was watching television before, I am now talking on the phone or surfing the Internet. One thing I have realised though is that I do not have to own a television set. Honestly, I only miss the news and the relaxing evenings I sometimes had seated on the couch watching soap operas. Still I am aware that once I get a television, I will soon be addicted to some of the television programmes I used to be watching. Furthermore, I have also noticed to which extent people around me are discussing television programmes. The discussions, as well as the topics of the discussions, seem endless. For someone in my situation, it is almost impossible to follow and be active in those. However, my grandfather once told me that in the beginning, when there was only one television channel, everyone was watching every programme and all discussions in his office the following day were about television. When my mother grew up, she was looking forward to the Saturdays when the whole family went to their neighbour to watch "Hylands herna" on their black and white television. Not many families owned a television then and the neighbours were one of the first to buy one. Today, the situation is completely reversed. A living room without a television set is like a relationship not built on love. In fact, exactly the same thing is happening with the computer phenomenon today. There are hardly any families, at least not families consisting of teenagers, without a computer connected to the Internet. The time spent in front of the television set today was the time spent on social activities fifty years ago. Nowadays, people claiming they can not go to the leisure centre or a dinner party is often heard. To miss only one episode of one of the several serial stories they use to watch feels unbearable. In addition, the way of socialising has changed radically in recent years. To have a night with the friends seated in silence with a huge bowl of sweets in front of a box with a screen does not sound odd at all. On page 165 in the book "Amusing ourselves to death" Neil Postman writes: " The problem, in any case, does not reside in what people watch. The problem is in that we watch. The solution must be found in how we watch". This statement, I would argue, suggests that we should use a critical eye and not swallow everything seen on television. In my opinion, television is a good information resource if we are able to select among the information and form our own opinion. People have to start thinking about what they watch and if what they see makes sense and reflects real life. Whereas Postman writes "we would all be better off if television got worse, not better" (page 164) I would argue that it is enough if people are taught to be critical and selective when watching television. To conclude, the television has definitely changed our lives completely. Slowly, almost unnoticeable, have people got used and addicted to life with television. People arguing that there have been radical changes in the ways of watching are right. The number of television channels has increased and the programmes are not about the same topics as they were fifty years ago. Some of those television programmes are notorious for not being serious or giving a sufficient reflection of real life. However, there are also numerous good ones as well. Still, in my opinion, seven years of our lives could be spent on something better...
EE355	1	﻿ Television, Entertainment or a Substitute for Absent Parents? Today it is very common that both parents in a family have to work in order to keep a roof over their heads, food on the table and clothes to wear. The idea of mothers staying home with their children is no longer just out of fashion, but rather impracticable, families can not afford it. Everything cost and many parents either have to work two jobs or a lot overtime. Then there are families where the parents are unemployed, and their economy is even more strained than that of the average Swedish working class family. The result of all this is a form of absent parenting, children who spend more time in front of the television than socialising with their families. Television is a great tool to educate, entertain and spread news. What I find less satisfying, is the way it makes people passive. Children who are sitting on their bottoms and watching for say five six hours without interruption do not get much exercise. In combination with a fat diet, mainly fast food, the result is overweight. It has become a people's disease. The amount of people with weight problems is on the increase. I really think this problem should be taken seriously. It is not out of malice that parents are using television as a baby sitter for their children. There are always exceptions to the rule, but most parents find no better alternative. At a curtain age children are too old to attend after- school-activities but often too young to be left home alone. Unfortunately some children do not like being home with only television as his or her companion. Television has a tendency to alienate children from interact with others, but also keep those who do not have many friends from seeking contact with other children outside their homes. Instead these loners find it more comfortable to remain inside and avoid potential rejection. Sometimes television can be scary. Even I as an adult am effected by what I see on it. I have learnt how to select what I am going to watch in order to feel good. I no longer watch horror films. If I did, I would probably be afraid of the dark, but since I do not I am not. When I think of all the children who are home alone watching God knows what, it makes me very sad inside. Maybe they are in need of explanations or comforting words, and have nobody to turn to. I am concerned about these reruns aired all the time. Some programs are not suitable for children to see. They are not mature enough. Usually these shows are aired in the evenings because of the rate violence, blood and sex in them. I can not find any reason why it is all of a sudden appropriate to air them during daytime just because it is a rerun. The violence is not any less violent and the scenes are not any less provocative to a child's imagination than from it was first aired. I can take shows as ER and Melrose Place as examples. I would not want my ten-year-old to watch them, especially not by herself. Another thing about television is that it ruins communication. I know that whenever I sit and watch, and somebody wants to talk to me, it is almost impossible to draw my attention to him or her. The television sort of absorbs me. Many families suffer from lack of communication. The dialogue is gone. By the time parents come home from work, their children have already eaten and are as for a couple of hours sitting in front of the television. Very often the parents are too tired to ask them about their day of school. In some cases the children have developed resentment towards the parents. Interpreting the lack of conversation as a lack of interest of their well being. Children's self-confidence is at risk. Too many children are feeling insecure and unloved. As a future parent I will try to let my children to be children for as long as possible. Playing outside with friends as I did when I was little will be encouraged. If they then when they come inside would want to watch something I find questionable, I will try to watch it with them. I would not want television to take my place in my children's life. At the same time I hope I will not stand in their way of growing up.$$$﻿ Why the selling of JAS to South Africa is such a step back for humanity I am going to discuss the Swedish government's policies concerning war materiel export and demonstrate why it is not morally defensible of Sweden to export to a country like South Africa. Sweden is the country with the most restricted export policy concerning war materiel in the world but is still exporting like there were no regulations. The war materiel in question is the aircraft fighter JAS 39 Gripen. The Swedish government hopes to sell fifteen of them to South Africa. In return, several Swedish companies will invest in the country, build new factories and employ lots of people According to Swedish and European law, export of war materiel is not recommended to a country in which human rights are being violated. In South Africa, during 1997, many cases of police violence were reported. Among accusations, were alleged torture, abuse and rapes inside prison walls. As many as one hundred and thirty four suspicious deaths were investigated, and one hundred and fifty guards were arrested for assaulting 155 internees so severely that they needed medical care. Unfortunately, the prison doctor denied them their right of medical attention. I would call this situation a clear violation against human rights. Another guideline to either sell or not sell war materiel is if a country suffers with internal armed disturbances, or not. Everybody knows that South Africa is politically unstable, with high criminal density, and with wide spread access to weapons. More than nine hundred people died between 1996 and 1998 because of armed conflicts. The third reason when not to export war materiel, has to do with if the recipients economic- and social development is at risk, by going through with a deal of this dignity. South Africa is a recipient of Swedish financial aid, and should not according to Swedish regulations be financially strong enough to buy JAS 39 Gripen, without jeopardising the economic and social growth in the country. As a fourth argument restraining Swedish export, is if a purchase could effect regional peace and security. It does not take a genius to realise what it would mean to the African continent, if South Africa were to buy JAS 39 Gripen. South Africa's defence is the biggest and most advanced in the entire Africa. Their military expenditure, 2,506 million US dollars, is second only to Egypt. There are no immediate threats, but the neighbouring countries could take offence, and a regional rearmament would be a fact. It makes me think of last summer and the tension between the countries of China, India and Pakistan. Tension caused by nuclear tests. I have to admit I was a little frightened for a while. I know those nuclear missals serve as means to keep the super powers in the world in balance, but I do not trust the men in charge of such powers. Men have a history of making bad decisions. I got really upset when I heard that Sweden is telling the South African side, that a purchase of the fighter aircraft would benefit the South African democratic development. I think it is outrageous that the Swedish government can talk about exporting war materiel and democracy in the same sentence. Money should be better spent by investments in food, medicine, housing and job opportunities. When I explained my standpoint to a friend of mine, he said that if we did not sell JAS to South Africa, some other country would and Sweden would lose a profitable deal. I am sure he is right, but I do not think we should go a head and do something so profoundly wrong as to sell JAS and thereby risk a peaceful future for Africa. I do not care if South Africa would buy a fighter from another country if Sweden would back out of the deal. At least our conscious would be clear. Two wrongs do not necessarily make a right. Sweden should instead serve as a role model. I hate to think I live in a country where profits are more important than human rights, values and quality of life. Sweden has in the last three decades, in spite of its restrictive export policy, sold a lot of war materiel to countries in war like Singapore, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Yugoslavia among others. The Swedish export of war materiel 1994 fetched 3,2 billion Swedish crowns. I think the signals we are sending out from Europe to the third world, as well as the fourth, are terrifying. We are making it harder for refugees and immigrants to enter any country in the EU and at the same time lessen our financial aids to their countries. It is a terrible double standard on the Swedish part. We used to work for solidarity. Where is that solidarity now? My fear is that the men in charge in Europe might have some devious plan to eliminate the third and fourth world by letting them kill themselves in war with each other, with weapons bought from Europe for a lot of money. Call me paranoid but these racist tendencies are frightening me. Sweden should instead work for disarmament support human rights.
EE512	0	﻿ Smoking ban in restaurants, cafés and bars Smoking is no longer a smokers own business. It has shown after several researches that passive smoking is almost as unhealthy as smoking a cigarette. Everyone should have the possibility to enjoy a smoke-free environment. Most places which are exposed to a lot of smoke are restaurants, cafés and bars where innocent non-smokers inhale the smoke. Jobs in the food and beverage industry includes late hours and a smoky environment. If one could prevent the smoky working environment jobs in restaurants, cafés and bars would become more attractive. This would be favouring the catering trade. The food and beverage sector have always had a high turnover rate. This change could lead to an improvement in the restaurant's recruiting-problem. Since they could offer healthier working conditions. The furniture in restaurants would last longer if they were not reeking with smoke and full of burn-marks from cigarettes. Restaurants could cut costs for new furniture purchases or having the furniture frequently re-covered. In regards to the cleaning issues the catering trade will save plenty of time when cleaning the floors which normally are covered in butts. The washing-up would also be easier if there are no ashtrays and butts in glasses and on plates. The restaurants, cafés and bars would increase the sale of snacks since the smokers can not light a cigarette after dinner and have to order snacks or perhaps a dessert to prevent their restlessness. Purchases of ashtrays are not necessary. The guests of the restaurants would be more satisfied when they are walking home with lovely smelling clothes, and not as the present situation, when clothes are reeking from cigarettes. A smoking ban would not only favour the catering trade but also the society. For many people smoking is an activity they do when they are socialising with other smokers in restaurants and bars. The prohibition of smoking would decrease the "social smoking" in public places and could also result in an increasing number of non-smokers. The society would be able to save costs spent on smoke related diseases. The allergy sufferers would perhaps not have any symptoms of the allergy if they were not exposed to smoke in public places and therefor many hospital visits could be avoided. Of course it exists counter arguments. The government receives a lot of taxes from the cigarette sales and a prohibition of smoking in restaurants, cafés and bar could decrease the sale and would therefore decrease the amount of taxes to the government. But the money the government spends on medical cost related to smoke disease would probably exceed the money collected from taxes. Some smokers argue that it is their right to smoke if they want to. But when it is proved that passive-smokers also run the risk of getting diseases related to smoke, it is no longer the smokers own decision. The present situation makes it difficult for certain people. Instead of having a smoke ban in restaurants and letting the smokers go outside when they feel tempted to smoke, they keep out allergy sufferer, pregnant women and people who can not put up with smoke. Restaurants make small attempts to have smoke-free areas for the people who can not stand smoke. But it is difficult to shut out smoke from one room/corner to another. The smoke still bother the people in the designated non-smoking areas. The city of Vancouver in Canada initiated the ban of smoking in western Canada three years ago. It is still an issue under debate, since the people have not gotten used to it yet. Spending two weeks in Vancouver gave a deeper insight of the smoking ban. Barowners argue that they have lost sales because people visits the bar less, since they can not enjoy a cigarette while having a drink. However, in the long run people will become used to the idea of smoke-free bars. Since Sweden is such a health conscious country the idea to ban smoking in restaurants, bars and cafés should come as no surprise to the Swedish population.$$$﻿I have lived one year in an English-speaking country and during that period of time I learned many new things about the English language. But I'm not yet satisfied with what I know, there are still many aspects of English that I can and wish to improve. I regret that I don't have a chance to listen to English being spoken more often. Since I don't have cable-TV at my house I don't get the chance to watch American or British TV-channels like CNN, BBC and such, which I believe would be a very valuable asset for anyone who wishes to improve their English. There are always subtitles on Swedish television, and it is almost impossible to both read the text and have full attention for the listening-part. I have once or twice borrowed some audio books narrated in English at the library, just to hear the language, but I found it rather dull and prefer to read the book instead. I have no problems understanding spoken English and I think this might be a natural effect from having spent a long period of time in an English-speaking country in which you hear the language around you all the time. When I first came back from the United States I found it easy to speak English. But as time went by and as I spoke less English I discovered that my fluency and security about speaking English did in some sense decrease. And now after being back in Sweden for three years I have noticed that when speaking to somebody in English it takes me a while to get my accent and fluency back. I have discovered that it doesn't matter how much I read or how much I watch American TV-shows, but to improve and retain the American accent I once had I have to practice talking. It's certainly not fun to talk to yourself, but I think it could be practice enough to just read something out loud every once in a while. Sometimes when I speak English I realize that I don't have the exact words for a specific thing I want to say. I know I have a very limited vocabulary and this can be a problem at times, even though I suffer from this mostly when I'm writing. It seems that even though I do read a lot in English, I don't learn that many new words that I wish I was. I know I need to put more time and effort into learning new words, but when I read a book I don't want to put it down to look a strange word up all the time, even though I know this is a good way of learning new words. But the effort that this demands takes away the amusement about reading the book. I really wish that I had a better vocabulary, and regret that it is so difficult for me to expand it. I don't come across that many situations where knowledge of English is required in my everyday-life. I have been writing letters in English for many years and started writing to some American people when I was around twelve. I think this was a good way for me to get to know another side of the English language from the one I heard on TV or learned in school. I still write to some of them and this is, apart from reading some novels in English once in a while, the most active contact I get with the English language in my everyday life. Since writing includes so many different kinds of areas e.g. spelling, grammar, vocabulary etc. this is where I think you can discover whether a person is good in English or not. At times I find it very difficult to write in English, it might be hard to now the exact expression for a certain thing or uncertainty about grammar and spelling. Even though I'm not satisfied with my knowledge in English as it is today I know that my spending a year in the United States has helped me quite a lot, in the sense of fluency and vocabulary. And some of the words I learned there might not be of any valuable use in an everyday conversation in any other country but the United States. But it's fun to know these words and different kinds of American brands or makes when they are mentioned on TV or in a context of any other kind.
EE212	0	﻿ Monarchy- an archaic tradition Sweden has been a democracy since the 1920s but I believe one cannot consider Sweden to be truly democratically governed until the head of state is elected by the people. The time has now come to shed the archaic tradition of monarchy and realise the importance of democratic values. Democracy is a cornerstone in today's society and most people would not want their country governed in any other way. Yet the people in Sweden are not allowed to elect the head of state, a person who represents our country in various situations. That fact violates the right of the people and to some extent also weakens our democracy. Today the Monarch merely serves as a symbol for our realm, a role that an elected head of state could play with equal or more success. If one also take into account the enormous amount of money the royal family cost the Swedish society, one have to agree that all taxpayers should be granted the ability to influence which person to spend that money on. Furthermore, one have to consider the burden forced upon the royal family.. To begin with, the firstborn, destined to be king or queen, have basically no other option than to accept the decision made for him or her while still in the uterus. Taking away someone's free will in that manner, cannot be considered otherwise than completely immoral and must be thought of as an abomination. Of course, one might argue that Victoria might very well grow up to be an excellent queen, who enjoys her job, but who can tell what path she would have chosen in life, if given the opportunity. Secondly, it is not only the monarch himself or herself who carries the heavy burden of not having the liberty to choose. It is, unfortunately, inflicted upon the whole royal family,. who are all being scrupulously exploited by tabloid media. The media examines every word the royalties utter and pays no respect to privacy. Surely one must agree, that the decision of being such a public person must be made of choice. Moreover, one can ponder about another duty forced upon royalties, namely the duty of producing heirs to the realm. In today's society it is not an uncommon choice to not have children, would it be possible for the monarch to make such decision. And consider a scenario where the monarch is unable to have biological children or if the firstborn child suffers a handicap. What would happen to the succession? Today the crown would probably be handed over to some other poor soul, who happens to share genetic patterns with the monarch. Having read all the arguments above, one might argue that the monarch of today has no real power, he or she does not rule the country. To a certain extent, however, there is some power conserved within monarch. The views and opinions of the royal family still influence the, luckily enough, decreasing number of royalists. The argument mostly used in this debate seem to be that we should not abandon our tradition, but since both good and bad tradition exists in the world today, it cannot be regarded as a good argument. After all, the main argument the people who opposed to democracy used, was that it was not the tradition. It might take some time to introduce a new system. One have to give much thought to what kind of responsibilities an elected head of state should have. Should it be the same ones as the former monarch or is it better if the person has more power? Finding a satisfactory election system will take time and effort as well, but even so I am certain that in a few decades Sweden will be a republic. To conclude, the process of democratisation is enormously important and should stand, by itself, as a reason to abolish monarchy. The arguments for keeping it are far to weak and a inherited post of head of state must be recognised as a thing of the past.. Let us remove the heavy load placed upon the royal family and unite the Swedish people in a republic!$$$﻿ Unemployment jobs Unemployment is an enormous problem in our society. But its not just a problem to society; above all its a problem of utmost importance to those affected by unemployment. Unemployment affects thousands of our citizens, not just the people who are unemployed, but their families and friends as well. The time has come to do something about this problem. There is a solution that is as simple as it is ingenious: unemployment jobs. It seems appropriate to begin this report on unemployment jobs with a definition of what they are. An unemployment job is a job in the public sector that is created to give work to an unemployed person. A person who has a job of this kind is called unemployment worker. There are several reasons why we should create unemployment jobs. First of all, unemployment benefits arent of benefit to anyone. They are a burden to society. We spend a large amount of the taxpayers money on unemployment benefits, but we dont get anything in return. At the same time they are a burden to the unemployed who become passive by receiving money without being expected to do anything at all. They often feel betrayed and rejected by society and cant see any possible way to change their situation. Secondly, unemployment jobs will be an effective means of reintroducing people into society. They will get used to get up in the morning and go to work. The feeling of doing something important will make them proud of their achievements and will boost their self-esteem. This will help them to find employment elsewhere, which is of course the main aim of this reform. Furthermore, society will benefit from the unemployment jobs. The previously unemployed are going to give something back to society; thus everyone will gain something as a result of the unemployment jobs. Its a well-known fact that the public sector is suffering from a great lack of manpower at present. This shortage is particularly acute in schools and old peoples homes. Unemployment workers will be of great assistance in these fields even if they havent got any formal education. For instance, an educated teacher will of course have the main responsibility for teaching his or her class, but an unemployment worker can help the pupils with their assignments. He or she can also help the teacher with keeping discipline in the classroom. Pupils will benefit from more adult help and a calmer school environment, more suited to effective learning. In order to make a success of this reform, introductory instruction will be available to unemployment workers and they will of course not get tasks they are incompetent to execute. They will also be given the opportunity to choose where they want to work when this is possible. Unemployment workers will be given time off to go to job interviews as well. To encourage the unemployed to participate, the salary for an unemployment job will be higher than the unemployment benefit is today while the unemployment benefit will be somewhat lowered. There are critics saying that we are going to create unnecessary jobs just to keep everyone occupied and that the unemployment jobs are the kind of jobs that no one would take if he or she had a choice. As mentioned above, these jobs are very important. It is true that the unemployment jobs arent the most prestigious and popular jobs available, but we must remember that these jobs are supposed to be temporary. The reform is aimed at helping the unemployed back into the ordinary labour market, not to create a second one just to fill the need of the public sector. An added bonus to this reform is that there will be a number of ordinary jobs created in addition to the unemployment jobs since the unemployment jobs has to be administered and supervised. Finally, the need for unemployment jobs has to be emphasized. They are going to fill an important gap in the workforce of the public sector. But whats most important is that they will make the unemployed feel useful and facilitate their re-entry into the ordinary labour market. The unemployment jobs are going to be of benefit to both society and the unemployed.
EE467	1	﻿ CENSORSHIP- FRIEND OR FOE? Very few issues brought up to discussion cause so strong feelings as the issue of censorship. This is not surprising at all, since the censorship mostly has been used as a sophisticated and useful weapon by oppressors. However, in modern democracies censorship can be used for the sake of the good, mainly to protect people, children in particular, from visual impressions that are considered to be bad for them. Sweden for example has had the National Board of Film Censors since 1911, which has authority to select which films will be shown in cinemas, and to which age group they are advisable. The big question though, is if this at all is necessary. Are not people intelligent enough to choose themselves which films to see and not to see and intelligent enough to tell the difference between fiction and reality? After all, we all know that films like Die Hard and E.T. are fiction because this is the very nature of film, and we are grown up with that knowledge. Today's film could be said to correspond to the old story-telling by the fire, with the difference that in those days people made up their own pictures of what they were told. In view of this, maybe the fact that others produce the pictures is the reason why we would need censorship. When we create them ourselves our brain uses images that we have gathered piece by piece over a long time, which makes them easier to deal with, whereas the image we are exposed to which does not origin from our own imagination may be a visual shock hard to handle. Children are of course more receptive while they have less experience of life than adults, and I think there are few who cannot recall at least one occasion in their childhood when a frightening film scene or TV programme resulted in nightmares. Me myself had parents who firstly gave me comfort and secondly helped me to relate to what I had seen by explaining it. Moreover, they did not let me watch films and programs they did not think I could handle. Probably, Government censorship would not be needed if all parents took their responsibility and protected their children like mine did, but sadly all of them do not. This considered, I believe in censorship, at least in theory. In practice, on the other hand, the question is if censorship works like we would like it to work. The National Board of Film Censors may do a great job when selecting which films are suitable to which age groups, but what is the point when no one checks the ages of the cinema visitors? I have not heard of one single person who has been requested to prove his/her age when entering. Personally, I believe that the cinema owners are more interested in their profit than in the citizens' well-being. At home, which ought to be the place in need of censorship more than any other place because of the endless amount of channels, we do not have one. As mentioned in the article by Ginia Bellafante, the situation in the US is the same. According to Bellafante, the suggestion to introduce a computer chip which could be programmed to delete programs with a high level of violence was met with scepticism from people who see the chip as a threat to the freedom of choice. I prefer to think of it as an increasing opportunity for parents of choosing. To sum up, although the current situation in terms of censorship, neither here nor in the US, is ideal, there is no evidence that a society totally without censorship would be any better. For the same reason as we have a social welfare service, namely because we are striving for equality and justice, we should have censorship to protect those who cannot protect themselves. However, the mode of procedure must be improved, or it is useless. Ultimately, this is an issue of politics.$$$﻿ The Characteristics of Normality I will here try to describe one of the main characters in Ken Kesey's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest": Randle Patrick McMurphy. This energetic, happy-go-lucky, stereotypical man whose zest for life caused his tragic death, definitely makes a strong impression on the reader. However, I believe that a description of his personality requires more than one feature, namely three. Apart from the loud and macho McMurphy you find both a man who is intelligent and calculating, and one who is sensitive and careful. The most distinctive features of McMurphy; the boisterousness and the humour, are obvious to the reader the first time we meet him i.e. the morning when he arrives at the ward. He talks with a loud voice, laughs a lot and does not give the attendants one single opportunity to worry him. The style of language he uses is very informal and full of sexual allusions, and has always got a jocular undertone. This vivacious and gregarious style shows clearly when he introduces himself to the patients: "My name is McMurphy, buddies, R.P. McMurphy, and I'm a gambling fool" He winks and sings a little piece of a song: "and whenever I meet with a deck of cards I lay... my money... down" and laughs again. The fact that he takes up so much space indicates that he is self-confident and used to being in the centre with people listening to him. On the other hand it would be possible that he gets that confident only when he is surrounded by nervous and stammering mental patients. However, the situation at the gas station on their way to the fishing tour proves this to be wrong. Although you expect the doctor (who, together with Candy, is the only one in the group considered healthy), to be the one putting an end to the service-station men's attempt to take advantage of the patients, McMurphy is the one who does it, in a truly convincing way. The respect McMurphy commands brings with it power, and the fact that he does not take advantage of his natural position as a leader on the ward is a sign of him being a caring fellow creature. In several situations, for example the one where one of the black boys is forcing soap upon George in the shower, McMurphy takes the risk to get punished just to protect his friend from being humiliated. He also shows talants as a psychologist when he with sophisticated methods, not unlike those you use on children, makes the most insecure patients feel confident and strong. Chief Bromden, for instance, get promised" McMurphy's special body-buildin'course" and on Bromden's question how McMurphy is going to get him big again, he gets the answer: "[...] Hoo boy, blowin' a man back up to full size is a secret you can't share with everybody, be dangerous in the hands of an enemy. You won't even know it's happening most of the time yourself." Another example can be found in the passage on p. 103; during a Monopoly game it is implied that McMurphy has been cheating on behalf on Martini, just to make him equal in the game thus give him some confidence. Moreover, McMurphy seems genuinely happy at the sight of his fellow patients getting better. This shows clearly when they are out on the fishing tour, and McMurphy is standing at the cabin door just looking at the others and laughing. In both characteristics mentioned above, his intelligence is clearly evident; to be as quick-witted as he is you definitely need to be clever. Equally, gambling, which seem to be his main hobby, requires a great deal of thinking. Undoubtedly, you have to take into consideration the fact that he lives on a mental ward, among people whom anyone easily could fool. However, we know that his former life was quite a hard one, and he probably would not have made it if he had not got brains. One example of his calculating mind is given to the reader on p. 17, when he tells the others that he did not argue with the court when they told him he was a psychopath, because he thought a stay in a mental hospital would be much more comfortable than going back to the work farm. To sum up, the reason why Randy McMurphy's personality so clearly sticks out from the others' on the ward, nurses and attendants included, is that he has all the characteristics of a perfectly healthy human being. As one of the doctors muttered in the staff meeting where they were discussing McMurphy's "planned violent acts"; "Of course, the very nature of this plan could indicate that he is simply a shrewd con man, and not a lunatic at all."
EE466	0	﻿ Gay parents are as good as any parents! In this essay I would like to discuss a very burning issue in today's political debate, the issue of gay adoptions. The most common argument as to why we should keep the legislation of today, which prohibits gay adoptions, is that it is in the children's best interest. Growing up with gay parents is considered harmful to a child. I am of the opinion that this is wrong. To show why I find it wrong I would like to take two examples of often used arguments as to why gay parents is a bad thing and discuss them. The two arguments I have chosen are the ones that I've found are most commonly used in the debate. The first is that a child needs parents of both sexes, so that it will have both a male and a female role model. The other argument is that a child with gay parents runs a much larger risk of getting bullied in school. I will begin with the argument which most people consider to be the strongest: a child needs both a female and a male parent, since it needs role models of both sexes. I will not deny that a child is better off if it can find a role model of each sex, but I can't see why these role models necessarily have to be the child's parents. If a gay couple with a normal social network adopts a child it is true that the child will only find role models of one sex in it's parents, but then you have to consider that the parents are not the only adults in a child's environment. Almost every child has at least some uncles, aunts, grandparents and/or maybe godparents, not to mention teachers, friends, neighbours, etc. If I take my own childhood as an example I find that my female teachers in compulsory school were much bigger role models for me than my mother was. So what's actually important is that the parents have a normal social network, and of course that they give the child the love, care and attention that it needs. If the parents live up to that I don't think it will have any importance for the child's well-being if the parents are gay or heterosexual. An interesting thing in this context is that the Swedish government already have acknowledged the fact that a child does not need parents of both sexes, as singles are actually allowed to adopt. As to the other argument I can't agree to that a child with gay parents necessarily will be bullied in school. Children are actually much more broadminded than we think. If only the adults in school are open-minded, talk to the children, inform them and allow them to ask questions about it, I think that they will accept that some children has two mums or two dads. But when I say that children are broadminded I don't mean to say that bullying isn't a great problem in school. But what I don't think is that the real reason as to a child getting bullied is that it differs from other children. Instead I think that a bully chooses a victim which is easy to bully, i.e. a child that is shy, quiet, lonely and won't cause the bully any trouble. If this child differs from the others in any way, maybe by wearing glasses, having differently coloured skin, or having gay parents, this is often used by the bully as a excuse to make this child an outcast. But that doesn't mean that this is the actual cause for bullying. I would say that a very shy and lonely white boy with married heterosexual parents runs a much larger risk of being bullied than a talkative black boy that finds it easy to make friends and has gay parents. My conclusion is that a child won't take any harm from growing up with gay parents. As you have seen the two main arguments as to why the law against gay adoptions is in the children's main interest are very easy to dismiss, and therefore I hope that you will understand why I'm of the opinion that this law is an act of discrimination. It is a scandal that a law which is based only on prejudices and misunderstandings can exist in a modern and enlightened country like Sweden.$$$﻿I have not spent a lot of time in English-speaking countries - in fact, two weeks in Michigan is my only experience of that kind. Nevertheless, I feel rather competent about my English at this point. This is mostly due to the fact that I went to a bilingual upper secondary school class, a so-called English Class, where most subjects were taught in English. Still, I can't say that I feel completely unconstrained when using the four skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. First, I would like to turn to the skill I enjoy the most: reading. I was about fifteen when I started reading novels in English, and since then I have been doing it on a regular basis. I wouldn't say that I understand every word in the books I read, but I understand the main content and I enjoy reading them. As for concentration, pace and so on, reading in Swedish and reading in English isn't all that different any longer. When reading for example the social studies books of this course, I appreciate the fact that words concerning government, education etc. are almost all familiar to me. Since I studied social studies in English for three years, I have managed to pick up most of the useful concepts. When it comes to writing, I am a bit ambivalent. I have always liked writing in Swedish, and it is something I have done throughout my school years just for fun as well as in class. Of course, this makes the fact that I by no means can express myself in English as good as I can in Swedish even more evident. I still catch myself thinking "Oh, this would be so much easier to write in Swedish!" every now and then. Still, I must say that writing in English has its advantages as well - it is so much classier than Swedish for example, sounds much more fancy. Turning to the skills that I don't appreciate all that much, I start with listening. I can assess by ability to listen like this: Sometimes I understand everything very well, and sometimes I feel like I'm not able to pick up more than a word here and there. Swedes speaking English are easy to understand, and the general American accent isn't difficult either. I have a much harder time with British English, however. There was a boy in my upper secondary class who was from a suburb just north of London. Not only did he use funny British words, like "snooker"; he also had a way of swallowing the last syllable of every word. Sometimes I just had to nod and smile, pretending I understood. More than three "Pardon?" in a row is a bit embarrassing. I guess the fact that American English is easier to understand than British English is mostly due to the fact that American culture surround the average Swede in another way than British does. Music, television, movies... Finally, the skill I consider my worst - speaking. If I was to speak English in an empty room with only myself around to hear, I would do it so much better than I generally do. In my case, it all comes down to nervousness. Not that I speak absolutely perfect English when there's no one around to hear, but at least then I would never say "both houses has...", "she were" and so on. For some reason I get so nervous when I speak English that I tend to get even the simplest concepts wrong, even though I know them well. I also get a tongue-tie that makes some words and sounds extremely hard to pronounce. Still, I do have my moments of relaxed conversation in English. When I notice that the person I'm speaking with speaks even worse than I do, I tend to relax and my English improves remarkably rapidly. And under the influence of alcohol, my tongue-tie disappears without a trace. So, as a final conclusion I would like to say that I would be very glad if my reading, writing and listening abilities improve, but that is nothing compared to the great relief I would feel if my tongue-tie could disappear once and for all after this course.
EE195	1	﻿ Should it be against the law to be a Nazi? Hatred of foreigners (xenophobia) has always excisted. People have always been afraid of the unknown, afraid of people and things they do not know. One of the big dictatorships during the twentieth century was Nazi Germany which was most powerful during the second world war (1933-1945). During this time millions of people were persecuted and killed. Those who managed to escape from the Nazis and the horrors of the war tried to find a secure place in the world where they could feel safe from antisemitism. Nazism is nowadays considered by most people to be an upsetting ideology that led to horrible violations against minorities and people of different ethnic origin. However nazism has not always been the prime subject of discussion and it has not always been clearly visible, but during the past few years the discussions about rasism and antisemitism have again been raised due to the violence and threats made by the neonazis of our society. The latest debate has been about the question of whether or not nazi organisations and their activities can and should be forbidden. My opinion is that nazi organisations should not be forbidden since banning these organisations would mean that not everybody would be allowed to have an ideology, an opinion or views of one's own and that is one of the human rights. Everybody should have the right to their own opinion, conviction and belief and they should also have the right to express them, irrespective of nationality, colour of the skin and religion. To ban an organisation would mean banning all their activities, such as demonstrations, meetings, concerts, distribution of music, magazines and information and thereby also the ability to express opinions. This would be a threat to democracy and human rights since we believe that everyone has the right to demonstrate and state one's opinion as long as one does not brake any laws by using force or offending anyone. According to our laws nobody is allowed to violate other peoples rights, and even if rasists have horrible views, they still have the same rights as long as they do not commit any crimes. Valid legislation must be used and interpreted so that society, people and their rights are protected. Legislation is for protection and therefore I believe that we should have a strict policy and not be afraid of using laws. These laws should protect everyone, except the criminals. Instead of banning the organisations and their activities it is up to all of us to show that nazism and antisemitism is not acceptable. Everybody has to follow the rules that are set up by society and the people in it. We all have the choice to listen to or to dissociate from nazi propaganda and information is the only way to enlighten people. Communication between "us" and "them", together with teaching history are tools for reducing xenophobia. If the organisations were to be banned there would be a big risk that they would go underground. They would grow under the surface. They would find ways to spread their ideology in illegal ways and authorities would not have any kind of control over them. Banning organisations does not make the problem of xenophobia and rasism disappear. Is banning nazi organisations the best solution for the society? I do not think so. If we use the argument that these organisations are not democratic we must remember that neither are we, if we prevent a particular organisation from expressing their opinion. Who gives us the right to decide which groups have the right to give their view. Even if these views can be horrible and disgusting, you still should have the right to state them. I become angry and frustrated when I hear nazi propaganda, but I still think they have the right to think and feel any way they want. If we were to decide that extreme nationalsocialism is forbidden, the next question would be: Are there any more groups that do not agree with "our" views? In conclusion I believe that these arguments are reasons enough for allowing any groups of people to gather and think/discuss/propagate their opinion, even if this opinion disagrees with that of the majority.$$$﻿ Fear of the uncontrollable I will in my essay describe what I see as the main theme of Doris Lessing's novel The fifth child and I will also discuss the setting in which the story takes place. The main theme of the book is fear. Fear for the unknown, the unusual, the things you do not understand and fear of the things you can not explain or controll. Also the fear of loosing what you have been building up. The story takes place in a small town outside London in the 1960's and in the following 25 years. The story of the Lovatt family and their relatives and friends takes place in David and Harriet's large victorian house in a small town outside London, where all friends and family are invited to celebrate births, big holidays and to just enjoy the family life. The atmosphere is warm and friendly. Love and happiness is filling the house and the people in it, but there is always a sence of fear present. David and Harriet's dream is considered to be an odd idea. Family and friends are not very supportive, criticizing them and calling them old-fashioned, wrong-headed and mad for buying the house of their dreams. (Flamingo/Paladin pp 18) The lack of understanding and support can be interpreted as everybody feeling threathened, maybe by the self-confidence and determination David and Harriet are radiating or, maybe by the fact that this young couple is not like everybody else. We are all through the book reminded of the perfect family life where there is only love and happiness, but we are also introduced to unhappiness and fear of the unusual. We are given examples of different ways of handling and reacting to fear. Amy, Harriet's niece, is born with Down's syndrome. People react in very different ways to this child. Sarah, the mother tries to hide her: "But the poor baby was in Sarah's arms, covered up so as not to upset everyone...". (Flamingo/Paladin pp 33) We are given the impression that Sarah is ashamed of her and that there is something wrong with her. William, Amys father is keeping distance: "..... William, was not at all at the table, but lounging against the wall; and the little distance expressed what he felt his relation to the family was.......and his new daughter, the Down's syndrome baby, appalled him". (Flamingo/Paladin pp 32) I see him keeping distance as a reaction of him being afraid. Amy is not like the other children and he does not know how to take care of her, so he turns away. Harriet is looking for an explanation for Amy being different: "Harriet says to David, privately, that she did not think it was bad luck: Sarah and William's unhappiness, their quarreling, had probably attracted the mongol child.......". (Flamingo/Paladin pp 29) Harriet is afraid. There must be an explanation for why Amy is born with Down's syndrome. If there isn't one it could mean that it could happen to them aswell. We get a picture of Harriet convincing herself that their happiness will protect them. Then Ben is born. David and Harriet's fifth child. The mood in the book changes. All the happiness and joy disappears and the happy family life is destroyed. Everything is replaced with fear, uneasiness and distance between people. Everybody is afraid of Ben. Harriet is coming up with different explanations to what Ben is. He is considered to be something out of this world, "he is like a troll, or a gobbling or something" (Flamingo/Paladin pp 61) Nobody is able to connect with him, he is not one of them and the fear for Ben destroying the family or hurting someone is growing stronger, "'But he is normal', said Harriet, grim. 'The doctor says he is'. 'He maybe normal for what he is. But he is not normal for what we are'". (Flamingo/Paladin pp 79) Ben did not fit into the picture of the happy family, so he is sent away. When the dream that David and Harriet were trying to fulfill was about to be destroyed they were ready to protect it with just about anything, even sending their child away. Feelings of guilt makes Harriet bring him back. They try to make him fit in, but it never works, maybe because the fear and uneainess they are feeling. The fear of the different and the fear of not being able to control or explain everything in life is what The fifth child is about. The characters are reacting to fear in various ways and they are trying to protect themselves from unhappiness by hiding, keeping distance to and by sending away the people that are making them feel uneasy. Fear is always present but also the desire to preserve the happiness and your dreams.
EE194	1	﻿ Television - Friend or Enemy Do you let your children watch television rather than participate in a more useful activity, simply because it's so convenient to place them in front of the box? Without exaggeration I would like to say that television and the electronic media in a whole, has taken over our lives. In this essay I'm going to put forward my opinions and views, when it comes to the importance of the television in modern society, and in the family of today, and I will also look at some points and comparements of the present and the past influence that television has had on us. In my considered opinion there are both good and bad sides to the television media today. There is absolutely no doubt that television has defracted from the traditional family values that my parents know and love. In not too distant time the opinions of the older people in the community were listened too, valued and acted upon, due to the fact that these people were respected. Nowadays so little time is actually spent by parents educating there young in traditional values, that the message has been lost, the message to respect and listen to what your parents have to say and think. In many ways the advent of television could be blamed for this. It is now long ago, since the television was considered to be an amusement box only. The development has gone quickly, and on the way we have lost a lot of important values. I do not have to think long to be able to give an example, as my own family is a perfect one. I remember as a child, I was never allowed to watch much television at all, and now a decade later my twelve year younger sister is growing up, with only a few minor restrictions within the area. I do not think that the big difference in our upbringings in this particular matter, has been a specific intention of my parents, it has been more of a result of the changes in society and in particularly the impact of television as a media. Ten years ago it was still the parents who had the "power" to decide what the child was allowed to see on television and not. Today it is harder to be a parent, as the spectra of programs that have children as their target group is getting bigger and bigger. In addition to what I just mentioned, I also would like to point out what an extremely important role television plays in the early years of a child. When you think about how much information children of today take in from watching television, you realise the importance of the actual content of the programs. They are no longer there only to amuse but also to be a good, trustworthy and educating media, seeing as children do spend a lot of their time in front of the box. It is not easy though when you think about the hard competition there is in most modern countries between television channels today, to catch the eyes of watchers with an educating program and on the same time be interesting, funny and extraordinary. That is what the hard concurrence that rules nowadays is all about. If you have this in your mind that programs for children actually do get more and more educating and interesting you soon realise that there is not only a bad side of the story. Of course it's not good at all if parents use the television as a stand in baby sitter, but if the different channels follows the development in society and adjust their programs to the new target group, it can also be good. To sum up this discussion I would like to point out the enormous change that television has gone through over the last ten years. I believe that the development will go on, even if in a slower tempo during coming years. This fact should not only be looked on as being a bad development but we should also realise that the new technology brings us a lot of information that we never would have got hold on without it.$$$﻿ BOY SHOT DOWN IN SCHOOL! When did Sweden become a country like any other country in the world? When did we first start to worry about locking our doors while going away to the shop? When did we for the first time feel that we had to take an extra look over our shoulder while walking the dog, to make sure that their would be no one behind us? How did this happen to us in this country that used to be known as one of the greatest and safest countries in the world, and why did this happen? These are questions that one can ask himself when it's over and too late, but yet we have time to change things, it's not all over. My belief is that we have to start this process by looking closer into the school system, after all that is where it all starts. Recently we've been given shocking news about the situation in Swedish schools, both from media, like newspapers and television, but also locally through neighbours and local authorities. It's when it comes down to this level that people starts to wake up and realise that something isn't right. What is wrong with schools in Sweden today, and what can be done about the problems? Some people believe that the solution is to upgrade the laws that involves the way schools are ran today. To increase the personal safety people are suggesting to have metal detectors be installed in certain schools or let guards patrol the school area to make sure that everyone is safe within the premises. I don't think that is the right way to handle the problem. We have to believe that it's possible to go back in time and find an explanation to when and why things started to drift out of hand. I believe that we make an enormous mistake if we go down the same road as they have done in the US to solve problems, a system where peoples integrity is more or less gone and where the school has given up it's responsibilities to policemen, who now are responsible for the safety and well-being of the students. I do understand that school-boards in schools with difficulties do have to put up with an enormous amount of criticisms from parents and society. They are more or less forced to do something radical about the problems, as quick as possible. I also think that now is the time to stop and think not only one time but twice, before we make a mistake that will leave scars in our nation for ever. So now I've said that the easy solution is not always the best one. That was very easily said, but to give examples to what could be done instead is not as an easy task. I'm not saying that I know the best way to tackle the problem, but what I do know and what I think is the elementary answer to all the questions that are related to this problem, is that we have to start believing in the goodness of people again. Once we start trusting each other we can start solving the problems we have. To do something like installing metal detectors to make sure that no one goes to school carrying a gun or a knife might solve an indirect problem, that some students for different reasons, actually pass the school entrance with some kind of weapon on them. On the other hand it certainly will not treat the heart of the problem. If you can't trust, you will not be trusted, in this case only held back. To sum up the content of my message I would like to emphasise upon how important I think it is to not be influenced to much by other countries. We who live together in this country have to build up the kind of trust that we used to hold for each other, starting with that we have to feel good about ourselves. Tell me, who would feel good about themselves if they weren't trusted?
EE197	1	﻿ The Swedish purchase of Gripen fighter planes. Introduction Sweden is right now in a process of upgrading the airforce with new Gripen fighter planes, which eventually will replace the old Viggen system. The idea of a new aircraft, to modernize the Swedish Airforce and later take over after Viggen, came in the late 70's. But it would take several years before the first prototype stood ready. The criteria was that it had to be smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter, harder to detect, with a better range and load capacity than Viggen. Another criteria was that it had to be nicer to the environment. After a lot of discussions and pie throwing, the contract for these new fighter planes to the Swedish Airforce were signed in 1982. The amount of aircraft in the order have been modified a few times and finally ended up at about 220 planes. The first operative division were placed at F7 in 1993. I think we needed this new Gripen system to replace the old Viggen, and to keep a modern airforce. Since Gripen is an instable aircraft it can turn in a smaller radii than most other aircrafts. And by instable I mean that it takes many cooperating computers just to keep the plane in the air, flying straight. In the future we might be able to use it in peacekeeping missions, maybe under the UN flag. In that case I think it would be reconnaissance missions, such as photographing strategic locations and troop movement. Since 220 planes are to many for the new military organization, we might be able to export the Gripen system to other countries and in that way make some money for the Swedish defense. South Africa have already bought a couple of fighters, and wemight have some other potential buyers in Austria and Chile, were we have been showing our new system. Austria have bought Swedish fighters before and they say that they are very pleased so far with the service and social contacts. As an answer to a possible counter-question I would say: -No, I don't think that every country who buy Gripen will use it for peacekeeping missions. But I still don't think that we, by exporting the Gripen system, encourage warfare and invasions. We only sell an airplane, not any special weapons, missiles or bombs for example. Those things they have to buy from other countries, just like we do, and that would be their job to stop unauthorized countries from buying these kind of weapons. I don't know if this is such a smart expression by the Swedish minister Goran Persson, but this is roughly what he said during a press conference: "If we don't sell fighter planes to them, they will get it somewhere else". That might be true. And in this case Sweden doesn't have anything to lose; we have to many Gripen planes, so why not sell them instead of having them standing useless in a hangar. This plane will last for many, many years to come, since you just have to maintain the body of the plane and then simply upgrade the software in it, such as the guidance system and flight system as a whole. This is pretty easily done since the Gripen planes consists of about 40 computers. Since this is such an advanced aircraft it must be limited not to do more than 9 G:s, because the pilots can't handle so much more and certainly they can not take as much G:s as the plane can. Due to all the crashes and delays many people think this whole project has become much more expensive than it was budget for, but they are so wrong. In reality, it became cheaper than expected. And since there have been a couple of crashes, people have had doubt about how good it really is. But, I say but again, almost every new airplane in the stage of development have crashed once or twice, because of so called teething troubles. You learn by you mistakes. Just look at the last Swedish system during development, Viggen, which made even more crashes than Gripen during it's first years. The first crash with the Gripen came when the pilot were going in for landing during the sixth flight. Another example is the American F-16 and the stealth fighter F-117, which have gone down a couple of times and still does. Despite of the cost for the Gripen project, we still have a fairly modern defense in the army and navy. The navy has just got a new ship called YS2000 and a lot of new material have been bought in for the army. This might show the rest of the world that "little Sweden" can do it on our own.$$$﻿ Today on TV This essay is supposed to show my reflections on the uses and abuses of television in society. I think that both television and computers have had quite a similar evolution through history. When TV first came, it was made for the wealthier families that could afford this new technology. This was also the case with the computer technology when it did break through. Today these kinds of technologies exist in almost every household and are a part of our daily life. The problem with TV today is that there are so many programs and news broadcasts to watch, almost twenty-four hours a day. For some people this is very devastating, because they might have problem getting their work done, for example schoolwork, preparing lessons etc. It's so easy just to sit down in the couch, to relax, flip through the TV-channels and simply get caught in front of the TV, instead of doing the things you should do. I know, because I've been there myself during the high-school years. Because of the fact that the selection of available TV-channels have increased, there is now at least one channel for all kinds of people, music, news, education programs, science programs etc, something for everyone to like. Because of this, TV has a big influence on our lives. Personally I think it's quite relaxing to study to the sound/music played on both MTV and ZTV. Because of the fact that these channels play a lot better and more various music than the radio does, my TV is on during the time I'm at home. TV is a great communication medium to reach a lot of people, with news, current events, science breakthroughs and a lot of other important information. But, unfortunately there are great deals of bad commercials shown too, some of them meant to trick people in buying worthless things. And many people do, maybe because it's so easy. It's just a phone call away. Lately, I think that Internet has gained ground against TV in several areas. You can see videos, moving pictures, read updated news, sports and learn about science in quite a funny way, purchase food, computers and so on. As with TV and computers in their early days, there was only a small part of the population that had access to the Internet a few years ago. Today almost every computer owner has access to the Internet in some way. I think that Internet will keep growing and affect our lives even more in the future. But still, TV isn't to be forgotten in the future. I think that TV programs and commercials influence children today more easily than it did ten or fifteen years ago. This may be because society today is more cruel and tougher. Some children programs show a lot of beating and violence in general, and they do it in a funny way. What kinds of impression do these programs give young children? They might think that it's OK to beat up their friends, just like the do on TV. And then they are surprised that he/she starts to cry or get hurt. It doesn't seem to hurt on TV. I think you have to teach your children that it's only a program, not real life, or don't let them see these kinds of programs at all until they are ready for it. At this point I'm just guessing, I can't speak from my own experiences because I'm not a parent, so please don't take it in the wrong way. Today there are a lot of soap/documentary programs, such as Big Brother, Villa Medusa, Mullvaden and many more. I don't know why these programs are so popular; maybe because todays stressed society don't allow ordinary people to do these kinds of things. Another possible cause may be that the viewers like to see other people in a worse situation than they are in by themselves. (I don't know, just guessing.) Anyway these programs have a very big audience that continuously follow the competitors "progress" on TV. As a conclusion I think that TV has affected our lives for as long as we have had access to it, and I think it will keep doing that for quite some time, even though Internet and computers will affect us more and more, whether we like it or not.
EE196	1	﻿ A three-course dinner Violent behaviour and teenagers committing criminal acts against other teenagers have increased rapidly in the last few years. This development has a source somewhere and the blame has been set upon television. This is according to me to take a shortcut because it isn't the real source of the problem. Locking out the violence, as it is described in the article, is a step in the right direction but maybe not the correct way to approach this problem. It has been shown that things we forbid our teens from participating in are actually the things most exciting to participate in. News has become more of a shorted Hollywood-picture rather than ordinary news. If you are to be somebody important in contemporary society you have to make something really astonishing. This forces the criminals to commit more fearsome crimes than they used to. This development should be blamed within media. Teenagers can still be turned around earlier and I think that we are not focusing on the problem properly. The root of the problems lies within what sort of role models we feed our teens with. Stallone and Schwarznegger-pictures don't make blockbusters any more. People are fed up with the ordinary. A blockbuster today is something out of the ordinary, something really shocking. That development can also be seen in news reporting. Local news has become more of a shorted Hollywood picture rather than ordinary news. Today's main topics seem to be more towards disasters, violence, and crime rather than politics and other social issues. You can't make high ratings today by having the head of state saying something about the economic situation in the country, for example. If you want the highest ratings he, the head of state, has to be involved in something fishy. That makes people watch. This development has made a substantial effect on society. If you want to be somebody, so to speak, you have to make something out of the ordinary to be acknowledged as someone important. Rapists are nowadays more or less, I'm sorry to say, a part of society. We are not shocked if a young girl is raped and this development towards a sort of acceptance is extremely alarming and absolutely dreadful. Culprits who want to make big headlines have therefor been forced, I would say, to take their criminal activities up to a higher level. Maybe the rapist needs to commit manslaughter if his criminal act is to be on the front page of the morning paper. If you were to ask a group of teenagers in the 1970's who their biggest role models were you would certainly get many pop-gurus or politicians as first priority. Ask the same category today and the answer might be more shocking. My guess is that many criminals are in the top 10. If you look at Sweden you will see that things like gang activity and muggings made by teenagers against other teenagers have increased rapidly in the last few years. These types of muggings, especially, are criminal acts that have spread like wild fire in the last year, within schools. This criminal behaviour originates in what sort of role models we give our teenagers. Giving our teenagers more believable role models is a solution that will last in the long run that's my opinion at least. The places to start with are the schools. I can give you a personal experience. I had, in 8th grade, a teacher who was very inspiring. He didn't give up until everybody in the class understood what he meant. This made the whole class like his subject, maths, and he made everybody pass the course. You could see that he really enjoyed teaching, not something that you can say about many teachers today. He is still today one of my role models and a real source for inspiration, that I can tell you. If every teacher where more like him more kids would be interested in doing their homework rather than going out in evenings. Teenagers have no proper role models to rely upon in contemporary society. Take a trip back to the 1970's and look a top ten of role models. Pop-gurus and politicians are likely to be found in the top spots. In contemporary society this list is more alarming, as it probably would consist of criminals and other bad role models for our teens. Today's focusing, in media, are more towards crime, violence, and disasters. This makes the teens to subconsciously receive a picture that this is the way to live if I want to be somebody. This also makes criminals commit more fearsome crimes than they used to. Locking out the violence is not the solution to teen criminals and violent behaviour. It has been shown that things that are forbidden are the things that are the most exciting. The V-chip, discussed in the article, would probably get the reversed effect rather than stopping the violence from increasing. It certainly is a step in the right direction, but I think we're forced to reconsider this alternative and focusing on the real problem here. Forming the proper type of role models could certainly begin within the schools. Making teachers more involved in their pupils is the right way start of with. Teachers can make a big influence on their pupils if they want to. Teachers that enjoy their work can easily turn around pupils that are going off in the wrong direction, but you have to see this development early if there is to be a chance for recovery. Teachers are substitute parents as well as teacher during the early years of school and this might easily be forgotten.$$$﻿ "Why spoil a good mother to make an ordinary grammarian?" Nineteenth century attitudes to female education During the later part of the 19th century British feminists and other groups in society began to question whether British women were entitled to education in the same extent as men or not. A young woman's teens was nevertheless only a preparation for motherhood, at least that was the main opinion during this period in time. Schooling was considered a way for a young girl to get social rather than intellectual skills, and that was something that she could get at home. What these reformists didn't consider was the fact that in order to make female education possible they would have to change the common way people thought of women, as mothers. And let's be honest, there were more arguments against than for educating the British woman. Opponents used everything from medical conditions, such as brain capacity, to economic disadvantages to make their point. What came to be a turning point in female education was the question regarding the British woman's role as a mother for future Englishmen. In order for Britain to remain a role model for other countries the British woman had to be educated in skills other than needlework and music to be a satisfactory mother for the future sons of Britain, at least that was the arguments used by the reformists. Opponents nevertheless continued to claim that women couldn't study the same subjects as men and certainly not in the same pace because men simply were more intelligent than women were. Differences between women and men regarding intellectual skills were constantly debated when trying to reform women's right for education. What seemed to be a typical woman attribute was that she was insightful and sensitive, hence quick to catch a point. On the other hand she had no ability to concentrate or weigh evidence in making a judgement, hence she had no stamina for studying in higher institutions. Opponents to female education claimed that the world had not produced any women counterparts to great men like Mozart, Shakespeare or Raphael. There were two other arguments that the opponents used against female education. First, as education was very costly, only those with the highest potential should receive education. Men had higher status and thought to have higher potential than women and should therefor be prioritized to receive education. The second argument used was that the higher up one went the educational ladder the less value was there in educating women since they were not capable of great creative work and had less concentration skills. What opponents used, as an argument for this, was the medical condition that men had bigger brains than women did and therefor women were unable to comprehend, let alone share, the great creative powers of men. There was therefor no point in trying to make girls study the same subjects as boys; it was a waste of time and money. Those few women who possessed the necessary skills for higher education were said to be a poor example of womanhood. As Miss Becker puts it, "They could hardly be considered well-developed specimens of womanhood". Education for girls were, as mentioned before, seen merely was a preparation for marriage for young girls. They were taught only accomplishments suitable for their roles as good wives and mothers. Feminists claimed that women needed skills similar to men's if they were to remain unmarried. This argument was unfortunately not one that made much effect on the debate. What instead became the turning point in the discussion about female education was just the question about motherhood. What people (mostly men) began to understand that educating the women of Britain was important because "they were to be the mothers of Englishmen" (Sally Mitchell) and needed domestic skills in order to perform satisfactory in this situation. The reformists used the opponents' arguments about motherhood against them and tried to scare them into think that the British women were unable to perform satisfactory in their role, as mothers, if they hadn't received the proper education required for the situation. Women's colleges were put up as a result of this reform and it soon was acknowledged that women actually could study the same subjects and at the same level as men did. So what made female education in Britain possible was the fact that the British became scared that they were gonna lose their position as role model country in Europe. Female education was during the later part of the 19th century considered as a waste of time and money partly because women were only seen as mothers and not people. They had less potential than men did to perform great creative skills, because of their lack of concentration. This assumption proved to be wrong when women finally got access to the institutions of higher education. As mentioned before, women had no trouble studying the same subjects and at the same pace as men. So the British population reconsidered their attitudes to female education, you actually can make a grammarian out of an ordinary mother.
EE490	1	﻿ McMurphy - a heroic rebel and a saviour One flew over the cuckoo's nest is a novel about a psychiatric ward in an Oregon mental hospital in the early 1960's. The ward is efficiently directed by Nurse Ratched. She controls the inmates by subtle humiliations, punitive shock treatment and lobotomy. Everything is neatly organised and programmed in this grey and oppressive world. But one day a new patient arrives and breaks the monotony. His name is Patrick Randle McMurphy. This man is outraged to see how Nurse Ratched has reduced the inmates to passive and lifeless puppets. In this essay I will give a detailed description of McMurphy. I will also try to indicate in what ways his characteristics are conveyed to the reader. The story is told by Chief Bromden, a half-Indian of immense stature who has pretended to be deaf and dumb for the last twenty years. His version of things is the only one to which we have access. Bromden's first impression of McMurphy is that of a very vital and strong figure. At first, the narrator is not able to see the new inmate, he can only hear his footsteps: "He sounds big. I hear him coming down the hall, and he sounds big in the way he walks, and he sure don't slide; he's got iron on his heels and he rings it on the floor like horseshoes" (p. 15). Even before Bromden has actually seen McMurphy, he knows that this man is "no ordinary Admission" (p. 14). It is above all his remarkable self-confidence that distinguishes him from the other patients on the ward. McMurphy is a redheaded, loud and laughing Irishman who has had himself transferred to the hospital from a prison in order to avoid work. He is a crude, vulgar and humorous gambler. Furthermore he is also a very good observer. As a matter of fact, McMurphy is the only one who understands that Chief Bromden is only pretending to be deaf and dumb. Many of McMurphy's characteristics are actually suggested by his actions. One of his most significant acts is to persuade some of the inmates to accompany him on a one-day fishing expedition. They all have a wonderful day on the sea, drinking an laughing. During this trip he restores the men's happiness and joy of living. Throughout the story McMurphy serves as an energy source and an inspiration to the other patients on the ward. Bit by bit he restores some self-esteem in these men and finally he breaks the hypnotic spell which Nurse Ratched has over them. He challenges the sadistic authority and the rigid routine that she represents. It is quite obvious that McMurphy is a man who refuses to adjust. Consequently, he disrupts the neatly organised system and creates chaos on the ward. From this point of view, he is a true rebel. McMurphy and the Head Nurse are truly each others opposites. She is a real monster, a devil in the shape of a woman, who slyly hides her anger and frustration over the new patient's rebellion beneath the sweet face of an angel. He, on the other hand, is a good, warm and loving person. Eventually, the brutal struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched become a struggle between life and lifelessness, between good and evil. In the end Nurse Ratched finds an excuse to quieten McMurphy by repeated shock treatments an a lobotomy. After this he becomes a lifeless "vegetable". Chief Bromden cannot stand to see him like this. As an act of mercy, he smothers McMurphy with a pillow and then he escapes by throwing the massive control panel (a symbol of Nurse Ratched's power) through the window. It is McMurphy who has taught him to regain the use of his enormous strength. At this point, the entire ward has changed radically. All the patients have become able and willing to struggle. Many of the "Acutes" have signed themselves out or otherwise taken control over their lives. Nurse Ratched is beaten. Her authority is finally broken. McMurphy embodies the belief that people are able to change, that everyone shapes his or her own life. But at the same time McMurphy himself cannot determine his own destiny. His destiny is to sacrifice himself for the other patients on the ward. He has to perform this hard duty whether he likes it or not. This is pointed out very clearly by the narrator when McMurphy is about to attack Nurse Ratched in the end of the book: "We couldn't stop him because we were the ones making him do it. It wasn't the nurse that was forcing him, it was our need that was making him push himself slowly up from sitting, his big hands driving down on the leather chair arms, pushing him up, rising and standing like one of those moving-picture zombies, obeying orders beamed at him from forty masters" (p. 250). I see McMurphy as some kind of a Christ-symbol. He commit himself to the other patients on the ward and assumes their burdens. He succumbs while the others survive. By teaching the patients to laugh and to believe in themselves he leads them out into the real world, into the world of the living. It is obvious that McMurphy is their saviour.$$$﻿It is generally agreed that English is our second language in Sweden. Almost any Swede is able to communicate in English. As a matter of fact, we are highly dependent on English for communicating with the rest of the world. However, I think it is important to stress that there is a big difference between the younger and the elder generation. I have been studying and using the English language for a long time, more exactly since the fourth grade of elementary school. In this essay I will try to evaluate my own strengths and weaknesses in the four skills of speaking, writing, listening and reading. Although I have been studying English for such a long time, I still do not feel comfortable when I speak it. There are several reasons why I feel this way. Firstly, I am not a natural speaker. I have always been quite a silent person in bigger groups. To give a speech in front of an audience is not easy. Secondly, after two years of French at the university it seems to me like my head is all filled with French grammar, French words and French pronunciation. Finally, I have not spent much time in English-speaking countries. I am well aware that I need more practise if I want my English to become fluid. Therefore I am planning a trip to England this summer. On the other hand I feel that I write English better than I speak it. When you write you can take all the time that you need and besides you can always rely on dictionaries and grammars when you find it necessary. That suits me perfectly. After four years at the university, I am also quite familiar with the process of creating and structuring thoughts and ideas on paper. One thing that I find difficult when I write English is to find the adequate words and phrases. Though the problem is easily solved by having a good dictionary within reach while writing. Another thing that often bothers me is the English spelling, but maybe it is only a question of practice. In our everyday life we listen to English all the time without even thinking about it. We watch English and American programs on television and we listen to music with English lyrics. When we go to the cinema it is often to see an American movie. My opinion is that this is the reason why listening to English seems so easy to me. In other words, it has been a part of my everyday life for such a long time that I do not even think about it any more. Since I started this semester I have noticed that I listen more carefully when I hear English. Nowadays I am more focused and concentrated while listening. I pay much more attention to what they actually say, what expressions and words they use and how they pronounce it. One of my main interests is literature. During my spare time I like to read novels and short stories. I consider reading very important, and I think that children should be encouraged to read fiction at an early stage. What is important is not what kind of literature you read. On the contrary, everyone should be allowed to choose according to his or her own taste. The important thing is that you read instead of spending all your time in front of the television or the computer. The only thing that troubles me when I read an English text is that I do not understand all the words. It is clear that my vocabulary is not sufficient. The English language seems to be so rich in words! I come across new ones all the time. In most cases I understand the approximate meaning of the word by looking at the context. But most of the time I am eager to find out the exact definition. Therefore I try to look up all new words in the dictionary. It is not easy to evaluate your own strengths and weaknesses in an objective way. At least, I made an attempt. During this semester I hope that I will improve my capacity in the four skills of speaking, writing, listening and reading in order to become a better communicator in English.
EE101	0	﻿ The flying trend I have no figures on it, but I think you will agree with me when I say that travelling has increased the last few decades. Swedish families fly to The Canary Islands like never before and young people take trips around the world just like that. Older couples go on charter trips and teenagers go on travels in the purpose of language-learning. I bet that you know one or two who really enjoys travelling and for whom it is almost a necessity to go somewhere every year. What are the causes to this increased frequency in Swedes travelling abroad? First of all it has become easier in different aspects. The development of communication has gone very fast the last decades. Planes can almost take you anywhere with their frequent take-offs. The time it takes to reach the different places is decreasing and so the world has come closer. I'm aware of the delays in air traffic, but they are not in any way a matter that would in itself argue against travelling. It is also easier to book your ticket. You can either go to an agency and they will arrange everything for you or book the trip yourself on the internet. Everything is arranged in advance as long as you want and can pay for it. There are however horrible things that speak against the increased travelling. Plane crashes have become more frequent, or at least are given more attention on the news. There are few or no survivers at all from such an occurrance. Still you take a greater risk by driving the car to the airport than when you are sitting in the airplane. Because of the many travelers the tickets have become cheaper and therefore more people can afford to travel. It has been an up going cycle. Travel agencies have established themselves on the market and increased the competition and lowered the prices. Of course it is not really cheap to travel, but if we compare prices over the last five to ten years they are less expensive today. Even less expensive than travelling within Sweden in some cases. People today have also more money to spend that they had only two decades ago. An example here are my parents. They have not traveled much abroad before because they did not have the money. In the last ten years they have been to Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the US. I know that not all families have got the same possibility like a middleaged couple, but we do things in certain times in our lives. It is naturally also a question of priority. A friend of mine counts money in how many trips she can take, while other's first priority is to buy a new car. Has travelling then become a higher priority over the last years? I believe so. The different experiences are today of higher value than that of material things. Maybe it is through commercials and TV-programs about travelling. There is also the climate of internationalization that I think have effected the travelling. Employees for international companies travel a lot and even national companies does when trying to build up new communications and cooperations. There are furthermore many students who choose to go to school abroad for some period in their education or they take a brake for one year and do some travelling. In today's society it is almost looked upon as a sort of status to have been abroad. By that I don't mean the Canaries, but more exotic places like Sumatra or Japan. Someplace that no one else in your social environment has "discovered". It gives a sort of satisfaction to be able to say where you have been and done. A pretty immature way of boasting but still a fact of life. We also have different motives for going abroad and what we like to achieve with it. For somebody it is only the experience of a new environment in stead of the gray ordinary everyday life that is tempting. For someone else it is a specifically warm or cold climate. You can go for the purpose of learning a new language or for satisfying your curiosity. You maybe want to meet people who have an other lifestyle and mentality. The newest thing is the adventure travels which turn to those who want experiences of the unusual sort and sometimes even of the dangerous sort. Thanks to the great supply of different kinds of travel it can attract very different sorts of people, even those who did not go before. It can be a sort of drug, at least for me. When I have been to one place and come home, it doesn't take long before I have an other place that I dream of going. A place I haven't been. This is of course nothing that happens for all but I have spoken to people who often feel the same way. Surely there are other ways than travel to get satisfaction but in order to experience faraway places, there are not so many other things to do. In short, travelling has increased for a number of different reasons. It is today cheaper, easier, and has a bigger variety of destinations to offer. People have got more money to spend and are giving priority to travels in a new way. It is also sometimes seen as a sort of status to have been somewhere special. The internationalization has also done a lot in the field of increasing travelling. So no wonder that people are travelling more!$$$﻿ It is OK to be religious When I was a teenager some ten years ago, it was still not absolutely socially accepted in Sweden to talk about religious matters. If you had a belief, you kept it to yourself. In recent years, however, the attitude towards questions about religious issues, such as the meaning of life and the existence of some kind of God, has become more open. Something that I believe is of somewhat greater importance to the development I am describing, I think is the commonly discussed separation between the Swedish Church and the state. This separation, which took place when we entered the new millennium, was prepared for and frequently debated in media during the 1990s. It was feared by some that many people would choose to resign their church membership when it was no longer something compulsory for every citizen. Some people even argued that there would be a great economic advantage involved in resigning which would appeal to the Swedes. In spite of this, time has shown so far, that people in general tend to keep their memberships and statistic figures even show that more people than ever, both children and adults, are being baptised into the Swedish Church and thus making a new and free commitment to this old religious institution. In addition to this widespread participation in religious activities, all kinds of media nowadays surround us with advertisments and discussions about an old religious document, namely the Bible. Only a few weeks before we entered the new millennium, a new translation of this ancient text was launched on the market. Actors read parts from it out loud on the radio as well as on the television and newspapers published series of articles about the Bible and the difficult task of translation, along with advertisements from churches and bookstores. The Bible 2000 was appointed Christmas Gift of the Year almost before the stores started selling it. All over the country, people of all kinds started talking about the Bible. Of course, not everyone is interested in its religious message, but the fact that the Bible is now open for discussion at all, makes it easier to be religious in Sweden today. Today, it is just as accepted to talk about the Bible when there is a coffee break at work, as it is to talk about a television soap opera or last night's game of hockey. As a result, this new openness makes it easier for those who do believe in something beyond this world to gain respect from others for the standpoint they are taking. However, although more people are being baptised than ever before, there are still those who claim that religious activities are boring and that the church service has not been adjusted to fit the needs of the modern human being. Nevertheless, near the end of 1999, the Professor of Religious Sociology at Uppsala University, Thorleif Pettersson, could show statistics that proved something completely different. According to his survey, more Swedish people take part in some kind of religious activity every weekend than those who go to watch some game of sports or even those who go to the cinema in the same weekend. Indeed, this is a sign of the trend I am investigating. The more people participate in religious activities, the more socially accepted it will be to be religious. Immigration might be one cause of this rise in interest in religious matters. Alongside with the growing number of immigrants in Sweden, the need for education about religions has increased to make a deeper understanding of the new Swedes possible. It is only natural that we wonder about those who look differently or dress in a different way from ourselves. Many of the differences between old and new Swedes' way of living have their grounds in religion, for example the fact that muslims do not eat pork. We need knowledge of religious issues in order to be able to reach an understanding of that which is different. However, I doubt that this is the main reason for the average Swedes' growing interest in discussing religious dilemmas Finally, one may ask oneself, if this new openness is only a fling of millennarian nervousness, a concern for the continued existence and wellbeing of the world in a new century? I hope not. I think that what has now become commonly accepted, to talk about different religious issues, would be a good thing for all of us to remember and to keep alive. It is no longer odd to be a believer in Sweden and it is not strange to confess to something which is on everybody's lips. It is okay to be religious in Sweden today.
EE105	1	﻿ Everyone Will Benefit from a Shorter Working Week. In an article in the Dagens Nyheter 00 03 01 representatives of the National Agency for Government Employers argue that a legislation concerning a shortening of the working hours will harm the state economy. I believe that they are wrong. In modern society, more and more people are becoming overworked and consequently, sick leave and early retirement related to stress are increasing. I argue that a shortening of the working week to 35 hours would help decrease these problems. In this essay, I will show that this legislation has the ability to pay for itself. I will start by showing how it will affect the working population and continue by showing how the state will benefit from it. I will also show how it can be financed without harming the state or the individuals concerned. Sweden's unstable economy with increasing unemployment and major cuts on welfare has made the workload heavier for many people. Fewer people are supposed to do the same amount of work as before and they feel that they have to accomplish even more to be sure of keeping their jobs. This has been a strong contributor to the increase of stress-related-illnesses during the last few years. Today, more than 250.000 people are on psychopharmacological drugs2 and people take sick leave due to stress. I am not suggesting that shorter working days would solve these problems but it would surely lower the pressure. People will get more time to spend with family and friends and more time to relax, they will not feel as stressed out and can thereby be more effective at work. Furthermore, many presently unemployed can get jobs and through that, more stimulating lives. However, I do not think that the National Agency for Government Employers disagree with me on these points. Their main concern is the financing i.e. how much this law would cost the state and the employers. In the article they claim that it would be vary expensive and that it has to be paid either by lowering or by making major cuts in the public sector. I argue that this will not be necessary. The initial costs can be financed by the state using the current budget surplus. However, in the long run I am convinced that a general shortening of the working hours will pay for itself, both by decreasing the state's expenses and by increasing its income. The state will not have to spend as much money on healthcare and medicine for overworked people. Furthermore, fewer people would depend on state benefits, such as sickness-, unemployment- and supplementary benefit. The fact that people are employed has a positive effect on the national economy in several ways. Firstly it saves money otherwise spent on benefits and secondly people who work pay taxes and they also tend to spend more money, which is important in order to keep the economy in good shape. Furthermore I argue that everyone; employers, employees and the state, will benefit from shorter working weeks, since the employees will have more energy and consequently be more effective the hours they do work.  Summary of the article: The National Agency for Government Employers1 in Sweden says no to legislation about a 35-hour working week. They argue that such a law would hurt the state as well as the population and say that this is a question that should be solved within the individual workplaces. According to them a general shortening of the working-hours would be very expensive and would have to be financed either by lower salaries or by major cuts in the public sector. They also believe that shorter workdays would lead to recruitment problems, especially within the public sector where there is already a shortage of staff. Their conclusion is that there is no way that this legislation could come through without severe damages to the state economy.$$$﻿ Lily Bart- Destroyed by Society Lily Bart is a woman whose primary goals in life are marriage and money. She has reached the age of 29 and can no longer afford to be choosy, she has to marry for money and not for love. In this essay I will discuss the reasons behind her goals and I will also look at why she fails to reach them. If we want to find explanations of Lily's behaviour we can start by looking at the setting. The House of Mirth is set in and around New York at the beginning of the 20th century and Lily is in many ways a product of this milieu. This was a time when money and prestige were very important features and when a woman's role was to be her husband's most precious jewel. Lily has been brought up as an upper-class girl but when she is nineteen her family goes bankrupt and soon after she looses both her parents. The fact that she has no money of her own and therefore has to depend on allowances from her aunt does not change her way of life, but it does change her prerequisites. In order to continue to be a part of the upper-class society she has to marry for money. Her upbringing makes it impossible for her to change her habits and live simpler than she is used to, her mother has thought her that there is something heroic in living as though you are richer than you actually are. Lily's worst fear is to be forced to "live like a pig" (p 30) and she would rather marry someone that she does not love than to submit to the fate of the poor: She had been bored all the afternoon by Percy Gryce-the mere thought seemed to waken an echo of his droning voice-but she could not ignore him on the morrow, she had to follow up her success, must submit to more boredom,...and all on bare chance that he might ultimately decide to do her the honour of boring her for life. It was a hateful fate-but how escape from it? What choice had she? To be herself or a Gerty Farish.... No; she was not made for mean and shabby surroundings,... Her whole being dilated in an atmosphere of luxury; it was the background she required, the only climate she could breathe in. Lily spends her time amongst upper class people and sees them as an image of what she will become once she is married. In their society it is important to have money and to show that you are rich through your clothes and your jewellery. At first Lily longs to be as them but after a while she sees them with new eyes: "they had symbolized what she was gaining, now they stood for what she was giving up" (p 53). Although Lily sometimes feels that she would be better of somewhere else, perhaps in a life with Selden, she is incapable of breaking free, incapable of a life without the luxuries she is used to. She cannot escape the life she has been created for. She has no training to survive in another form of existence: Inherited tendencies had combined with early training to make her the highly specialized product she was: an organism as helpless out of its narrow range as a sea-anemone torn from the rock. She had been fashioned to adorn and delight; to what other end does nature round the rose-leaf and paint the hummingbird's breast. (p 301) However, sometimes Lily is carried away by her emotions and when she does it upsets her plans. At one instance her emotions lead her to take a walk with Selden instead of going to church with Percy Gryce, and during this walk Selden presents a different kind of life to her, a life with him, with independence instead of money. However, Lily is way to conscious and planning to let her emotions carry her away to such lengths, she still intends to marry Mr Gryce although she has more feelings for Selden. However, this incident makes Mr Gryce change his mind about Lily. She has unconsciously destroyed her chances of marriage. Lily is tempted by the thought of a life with Selden at several occasions but always realises that "in the world as it was, such a privilege was likely to cost more than it was worth" (p 88). Lily's problem is that she is neither controlled by her emotions nor able to completely resist them. She lets herself be carried away by them at the worst possible times and this has more than once destroyed her chances of marriage. Maybe she does this because, as Mrs Fisher suggests, "at heart, she despises the things she's trying for." This is an interesting and possible thought. Deep inside Lily wants something else but she does not have the strength to consciously break free so she does it unconsciously, hoping that something better will present itself to her. Selden, who represents this other kind of life, works to trigger her emotions and to make her see the society she keeps in another light. He works as a contrast to Percy Gryce and as a window out of her secluded circle. The things that Selden says have a great impact on Lily, but not because she loves him or because of the fact that he is a man but because he strikes a nerve in her. Lily is the kind of woman that makes her own decisions; she is not controlled by men and has never had any strong male role models. Her father was very suppressed by her mother, in fact all the married men in The House of Mirth seem to be more or less ruled by their wives. In my view, Lily sees men as something necessary, a provider of money and status, but nothing more. The only man that has control over her is Gus Trenor during the period when she owes him money otherwise the men rather seem to be under her control. However, she lives in a world ruled by men, where women should be beautiful and decorative and this affects everything she is. She has been brought up to please men in order to get married because there is no other solution to live respectably. Furthermore, the fact that she cannot speculate with her own money makes her loose control over her debt to Mr Trenor. In my opinion Lily is a woman that controls her own life. She is very conscious of what she does and what she wants; everything she does is part of a bigger plan. However, she is what she is because of her upbringing, the time in which she lives and the society which she is part of. She has been taught that money and beauty are the most important things in life and that her role in life is to be ornamental. The problem is that she, somewhere deep inside, longs for something else, another kind of life. When she looses her self-control and lets her emotions carry her away, even if only for a moment, she unconsciously upset her own plans. She does it when she takes the walk with Selden, that I have mentioned earlier and when she borrows money from Mr Trenor that is also a decision made on an impulse. It is those impulsive emotion based decisions that make her fail in reaching her goals and finally destroys her but above all she is a victim of the corrupted society which she is part of.
EE223	1	﻿ Monarchy- an archaic tradition Sweden has been a democracy since the 1920s but I believe one cannot consider Sweden to be truly democratically governed until the head of state is elected by the people. The time has now come to shed the archaic tradition of monarchy and realise the importance of democratic values. Democracy is a cornerstone in today's society and most people would not want their country governed in any other way. Yet the people in Sweden are not allowed to elect the head of state, a person who represents our country in various situations. That fact violates the right of the people and to some extent also weakens our democracy. Today the Monarch merely serves as a symbol for our realm, a role that an elected head of state could play with equal or more success. If one also take into account the enormous amount of money the royal family cost the Swedish society, one have to agree that all taxpayers should be granted the ability to influence which person to spend that money on. Furthermore, one have to consider the burden forced upon the royal family.. To begin with, the firstborn, destined to be king or queen, have basically no other option than to accept the decision made for him or her while still in the uterus. Taking away someone's free will in that manner, cannot be considered otherwise than completely immoral and must be thought of as an abomination. Of course, one might argue that Victoria might very well grow up to be an excellent queen, who enjoys her job, but who can tell what path she would have chosen in life, if given the opportunity. Secondly, it is not only the monarch himself or herself who carries the heavy burden of not having the liberty to choose. It is, unfortunately, inflicted upon the whole royal family,. who are all being scrupulously exploited by tabloid media. The media examines every word the royalties utter and pays no respect to privacy. Surely one must agree, that the decision of being such a public person must be made of choice. Moreover, one can ponder about another duty forced upon royalties, namely the duty of producing heirs to the realm. In today's society it is not an uncommon choice to not have children, would it be possible for the monarch to make such decision. And consider a scenario where the monarch is unable to have biological children or if the firstborn child suffers a handicap. What would happen to the succession? Today the crown would probably be handed over to some other poor soul, who happens to share genetic patterns with the monarch. Having read all the arguments above, one might argue that the monarch of today has no real power, he or she does not rule the country. To a certain extent, however, there is some power conserved within monarch. The views and opinions of the royal family still influence the, luckily enough, decreasing number of royalists. The argument mostly used in this debate seem to be that we should not abandon our tradition, but since both good and bad tradition exists in the world today, it cannot be regarded as a good argument. After all, the main argument the people who opposed to democracy used, was that it was not the tradition. It might take some time to introduce a new system. One have to give much thought to what kind of responsibilities an elected head of state should have. Should it be the same ones as the former monarch or is it better if the person has more power? Finding a satisfactory election system will take time and effort as well, but even so I am certain that in a few decades Sweden will be a republic. To conclude, the process of democratisation is enormously important and should stand, by itself, as a reason to abolish monarchy. The arguments for keeping it are far to weak and a inherited post of head of state must be recognised as a thing of the past.. Let us remove the heavy load placed upon the royal family and unite the Swedish people in a republic!$$$﻿ Fantasy- an endangered species. In today's society, television is a great part of people's lives, mostly used for entertainment but also for civic information. However, as people, and especially children, spend an increasing amount of time in front of the television instead of turning to books or storytelling, it is time to be concerned. It is my belief that television endangers our imagination and that children of today, therefore, might grow up to have a somewhat poorer capability of fantasizing than we do now. About a hundred years ago, I spent every Monday evening baby-sitting my youngest neighbour, a four- year-old boy who loved watching television. When I arrived, he usually sat in front of it already but since I found Ducktales extremely dull, I grabbed every opportunity trying to persuade him to play any sort of game. One evening I got him engaged in a game of make-believe and we were pretending to be Robin Hood and Little John on a mission to free the lovely Lady Marion (need I mention that he was Robin). As the skilful sword-fighters we were, the villains were overpowered with ease and we were able to break into the dungeon (the bathroom) where the fair maiden was imprisoned. We entered and I stretched out my hand: "Come Marion, let us leave". The boy instantly let go of his fantasy sword, starred at me and said: "Karin, that's a bathtub." I was astounded and completely dumb-struck for a while, suddenly realising that the boy were not able to see the fantasy-world in his head, the way I did. I think of this episode with amusement but also great sadness. I believe it to reflect a matter of considerable concern for our entire society, namely, the risk of losing the ability to fantasize as a result of replacing reading and story-telling with television. When we read or get told a story, we are able to create an inner image around the events that take place. Thus, we can partially decide for ourselves what the characters in the fairy-tales look like, what the setting is like and, using our imagination, we are able to paint a vivid picture of this in our own minds. This process contributes greatly to the ability of creating fantasies. When we watch television, on the other hand, we do not get the opportunity to process the information the same way, using our imagination. All images are pre-made, not leaving much room for the valuable interpretation. In the end, this might lead to a decreasing need for imagination but also to damage on the gift of being able to fantisize. Obviously, all television programs cannot be considered harmful and maybe it is the amount of time spent on television, instead of creative activities, that constitutes the problem. However, much of the content on today's children's shows is violent. This might well be one reason why my neighbour was able to battle the villains, yet finding it difficult to visualize the "dungeon" and "Marion". I do not believe in vague explanations like little boys are born with an innate desire to fight. I believe they learn from society (as do little girls, in fact), and if so, violence on television should be avoided. Children are very impressionable and if they rely on television for giving them truths and facts about life, this might lead to less knowledge about human nature and an escalation of violence. To sum up, I believe it would be fantastic if the children's programs were filled with sensible messages with the intention of bringing up children to be intelligent and imaginative adults. Unfortunately, that is not case and the amount of time children spend watching television will probably turn out to be unhealthy for forming fantasies. Hopefully, the danger with television is just a figment of my imagination, but if the signs keep coming, we need to wise up and prevent this from happening. After all, fantasy is an amazing and powerful tool for keeping our existence vibrant and meaningful.
EE221	1	﻿ Europe: Co-operation or every one for themselves? It is the 7'Th of May 1945, Hitler has committed suicide one month ago and today Germany surrenders, the Second World War is over. The European continent is destroyed by the war that took the lives of around 50 million people. Today, a little more then fifty years later the former enemies are sitting side by side in Brussels and Strasbourg trying to steer Europe into the 21'st century. Since the start with the Coal and Steel Union the European Union has been guaranteeing a stable and strong platform for peace and democracy in Europe. During it's short history the Union has kept evolving as the bonds between its members have become stronger and stronger. The European Union should be allowed to keep developing and it should be allowed to handle the things that are of common interest for the entire continent such as the Environment, fighting Crime as well as the Defence and Foreign Policies. The union should be given more powers in these areas, not less. The protection of the environment is one of the most important issues of modern society. It is widely recognised by scientists that environmental issues can not be solved by any nation on it's own. The problem of air-pollution is a good example of this. Air pollution can travel great distances, thus affecting countries other then the one it originated from. It is financially very costly for companies to adapt factories etc. to become more environmental- friendly. National governments may therefore be reluctant to impose hard environmental legislation, since this might scare away investments. However, if all the countries in a region enforce the same legislation, then this problem is greatly reduced. The same argument can be used on almost all environment related issues. Another area in witch the European Union has a lot to do is fighting crime. Researchers claim that organised crime is growing every day. This type of criminality rarely operates in just one country, but rather over large parts of the Union. If we were to introduce a federal court system with common laws to fight narcotics offences, smuggling, financial crimes etc. over all of the EU, assisted by a federal police force, it would be much easier to map out these organisations. Today the local police forces try to assist each others (with varying success) but the difference in the police organisations, laws and bureaucracies of the countries causes many problems when it comes to quickly arranging police operations between two countries. A federal police force that could perform these tasks would be very useful to fight crime and co-ordinate the national police forces. The European Union of today is a Union of sovereign states, but states with common values and goals. The differences in religion and culture are not large and this has, in my opinion paved the way for the success of the Union. It is only reasonable for these countries to have a common foreign policy and military forces. Currently each member is defending there own border, if we were to decide to have a common military structure the amount of boarder lines to defend would be just a fraction of the old ones, and we would be able to greatly reduce defence costs for the member countries. We would also virtually have taken away the last possibility for another war in Europe. Recently the European countries demonstrated their common values by protesting loudly when Austria elected Jorg Haider's extreme right party to the Austrian parliament. The values and political traditions are very similar in the different countries and a united European voice would have a much stronger effect then the many small ones of today. To conclude this brief argumentation for a stronger European Union, with more power to affect the questions that are important for the entire continent I want to stress that "The European Union of today is a Union of sovereign states, but states with common values and goals". This is very important to remember when discussing EU matters. We can decide to choose a path for Europe where everyone goes on their own (a way that would have it's benefits for some well developed states) or we can choose the path of co-operation, the path of working together, the path of a union with common human rights values that sets a good example to the rest of the global community. Together we can tackle the problems and issues of tomorrow, together we can build a strong, stable and prospering Europe.$$$﻿During almost my entire life i have been hearing lots of different languages. I was raised in Geneva, Switzerland witch is a very international city in a country with no less then three large official languages. Both my parents come from Sweden and thus i spoke both Swedish and French fluetly by the time i was six. Since Geneva is such an international city my friends came from a lot of different countries so apart from the French and Swedish i was "exposed" to a large number of languages like German, Italian, Portugese, Spanish etc. The summer I turned ten we moved back to Sweden (after 9 years) and settled in Uppsala. My english at the time was probably about as good as any Swedish child of the same age. After a few years in Sweden i finished the 9'th grade and went on a one month English-course in London. During this month i stayed in an English family together with two boys from Denmark, however since my Danish is far from great we usually spoke English with each other... After this I started senior school in a nature-science program. I kept on studying German (a subject I started to study during the 7'th grade) as well as English and graduated with good grades in the three English courses that i could choose (A,B and C) Then after a semester of French studies at the University of Uppsala i am now studing English. As mentioned above i have been listening to a large number of different languages for large parts of my life. Allthough i did not speak or understand several of these languages i am certain that this has given me a good base for my spoken English as well as my understanding of foreign languages. Geneva is as I mentioned a part of the French speaking region in Switzerland and thus I was mainly exposed to french TV and music contrary to Swedish children that are usually exposed to more English TV and music. However the differance was probably not that large since a large number of the TV-shows intended for children are translated in Sweden as well. One thing that has probably been very good for my english is the one month trip i made to London. During that time i was more or less forced to speak and listen to english at all times and this together with good teachers resulted in a great impovement in my spoken english as well as my abillity to listen to and understand english. My abillity to write has always been rated differentely depending on the teachers that i have had. My spelling in most languages has always been shall we say less then perfect... however my abillity to come up with ideas to write as well as getting these ideas down on a peice of paper has always been rather good. When it comes to vocabulary i have also always had a fairly large vocabulary in the languages that i have spoken (however as mentioned the spelling of these words was not always perfect...) During senior school i did start to improve my spelling and I intend to keep working with it during this course. Reading novels has never been any of my larger interests, i have usually not considered it as a form of toture either but i have been more interested in other things. I have however always liked to read magazines that took up issues that did interested me. During the past few years i have been having a subscription to at least one english magazine every month (Focus and Airliner World are the most recent ones) I have also been reading magazines like "Newsweek" or "Time magazine" that my father has subscribed to. I would not say that i am a fast reader but i guess i am rather average in that area. to summ this up i think that the childhood in a "multi-lingual" environement as well as my brief journey to London have been very good for my english and that my main strenghts lay in speaking as well as in my abillity to understand spoken english. What i will probably have to work the most with will probably be the written english and then particularly the spelling and different writing techniques.
EE220	1	﻿ Do our living standards require that the state looks after the elderly people? This essay is mainly going to discuss whether we can take care of elderly people at home or if the best solution is to keep them in institutions. Firstly, the main reason of keeping grandparents in institutions is that our family attitudes have changed because of our different way of living, compared to the old society. Have we forgotten the social aspect with close family relations including taking care of our parents when they become old. Is this the fact because of lack of moral responsibility or is it a financial problem? These are questions hard to answer but still there are problems that can be solved by financial aid to elderly care and change in attitudes. Maybe the best way for caring about many elderly people is to put them into institutions. This subject will be discussed with the mentioned questions as topics. If this will not help you to see which is the best way to take care of grandparents, this can anyway give you suggestions of what could be done about it. If we compare our attitude today towards elderly care with how it was in the fifties we notice that the attitude towards old people have changed. A question can be asked whether we care less or not about elderly people today when the individual person is more stressed by all the choices and demands in the society. This lead to a generation gap which is a huge expanse between parent, child and the grandparents. It is said that young people and adults do not know each other. They live under the same roof, but they rarely see one another because at least one of the parents go to work before the children are awake. In this kind of family where a generation gap exists, it can sometimes be good to have a grandmother at home, giving the children some of the attention the parents do not give. On the other hand, if the grandparents are too sick and can not manage without a lot of care it can make the relations worse for this type of family. How we treat our old grandparents and children can be related to how we define life quality and good relations. Life quality today is usually having a good employment, friends, family and be rich enough to buy all the capital goods that an average income earner is expected to use. If the aim is to consume then we generally do have a high living standard but what about family values? The society has developed the humans to be more individualistic and self-centered. We have forgotten which happiness close relations in a big family can produce. We want to live with our nuclear family or spend time with our step-children or step-father. With the mentioned family-development there is no room for taking care of elderly grandparents, specially if they are sick. The moral responsibility for the family and parents that we used to have in the fifties, is history today in the Western European countries. The problem of not having the possibility to keep elderly people at home today is more of a financial problem than a question of responsibility. Living on one salary can be hard for bigger families if for example three children go to school and the family expenses are high. Then there are no financial means to spare for taking care of a grandmother. Institutions are good from an financial point of view, because today it costs often too much to be at home from work or keeping nurses at home to take care of your older parents. However, high-income earners should not have a problem with financing their elderly care. As long as they spend a lot of time at work they do not have the energy to take care of their grandparents. Now, as we know these problems for taking care of elderly people at home it makes even more complicated to find solutions to them. We can not go back to the fifties and think that we can handle the elderly care like the farmers did. The home care of elderly in old days also had disadvantages like poverty, even though it often was more social for the grandparents. It is difficult to change peoples attitudes. One thing that could be done for both families with middle and high incomes is building blocks of service flats for elderly in the families neighbourhood which could improve the social relations with grandparents. This would give the children and parents the possibility to visit them more often and also notice if there is something wrong with the service quality, so they could do something about it. The grandparents would also enjoy not to live to far from their children. An answer to if we do not have any moral responsibility over our grandparents can be that we are used to live our life on our own with our children. Nobody expects us to have time for taking care of our grandparents as long as we have service institutions for elderly and disabled. One way to make it easier to take care of grandparents at home can be giving financial subsidies to the families. Another solution can be to lower the fees for families keeping their elderly at service flats in the neighbourhood and letting the grandparents visit their home in weekends, if possible. On the other hand, I believe that the children having no interest in taking care of the grandparents should put them into service institutions. Then there is a major concern that the service quality should be improved, because today there are too little activities for the old people, mainly because of the institutions financial problems.$$$﻿ To evaluate my own skills in reading, writing, speaking and listening to English For getting a perfection in the English language more than going for holidays to Great Britain is needed. When you have learned how to write, read, speak and listen to English, then you are much closer the goal to get perfection in the language. The difficulty in evaluating your own skills in English is not to think of what you do know but what you do not know. For instance, sometimes I do not know the tense of the verb in a sentence and if I am not aware of it then I can not correct it. One way of getting around the problem is to get aware by reading and learning the English grammer. 1 Read I started reading English at fourth class in compulsory school. At the time I was quite shy and did not talk much during class hour, except if I was asked a question. Much later in life after I had studied French in 1995, I did join a course in English at the Folkuniversitetet in Uppsala. The aim was to get a "First Certificate" in the English language. I managed the examination and got an average grade. The reading part of the exam included reading short stories and answering questions about the stories. I can not say that I have a problem with reading English. English and American literature is familiar from courses I have taken in business economics for 2 years now at the University. However, I could learn reading faster as I get to know more English words by looking more thoroughly in the dictionary. Another way to practice reading language is reading more English novels and quality newspapers. 2 Write The biggest problem for me when I translate from Swedish to English is that I think of how the sentence is written in Swedish. I consider the problem is that I translate the English sentence due to how I think in Swedish. I do sometimes have a problem with tense, mode and clause elements in the English grammer. For writing correct sentences it is essential to know the clause elements and other important grammer. The positive point is that technical terms in business economics have been enriched in my English language. One of my future goals is to be better in writing English. The main object is to have or take time for repetition of the English grammer and especially work with what I already mentioned having a problem with. 3 Speak I think I have improved speaking English since I took two business economics courses in Market System and International Marketing. I followed the International Marketing course before December and I had to talk English all the time. Most of the students could not speak Swedish so English was the only language the international exchange students could speak, except their mother tongue. Speaking English in a proper way need knowledge about sentence structure and the right English expressions that I am about to learn. Some years ago I bought a dictionary in a bookstore that helped to translate from English to French / French to English. Ever since I have thought that I some day will know how to translate without difficulty from one of the languages to the other. 4 Listen To understand a language other than your mother tongue is not so easy but it is easier to listen and understand than reading, writing and speaking it. y skills in listening to British English are good but my understanding of other English speaking languages varies due to the accent. In the Market System course that I mentioned earlier, we had a man from California as our lecturer. The problem was that most of the Swedish students including me did not understand every tenth world he said because of his particular accent. Listening to another language also need a lot of patience. In return you can get a very nice English accent, if you listen carefully to British English.
EE025	1	﻿ "MCMURPHY'S FLIGHT OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST ": A description of the protagonist character in Ken Kesey's One flew over the cuckoo's nest Ken Kesey's One flew over the cuckoo's nest takes place in the early 1960's, and most of the time in one ward of a mental hospital in Oregon, USA. For many years, life on the ward has been calm and predictable. But when McMurphy is admitted, everything changes. McMurphy is the protagonist of the novel and he is a round character. I will give a description of him as we see him through the eyes of the narrator, Chief Bromden. The Chief is one of the patients on the ward, a big Indian who acts death and dumb. Having the story told by the Chief gives us an unusual, insider's view into a troubled mind and into the forces that trouble it. It also makes it easy for the reader to see the McMurphy as the imperfect but heroic character that the other characters see him as. We see clues to McMurphy's character in the first sentence the Chief uses to describe him. "... I know he's no ordinary Admission." (p.14) He describes him in a way that shows how different he is from the other Admissions he has seen entered the hospital before. He is thinking that McMurphy talks too loud: "He sounds like he's way above them, talking down, like he's sailing fifty yards overhead, hollering at those below on the ground. He sounds big." (p.14-15) And then he shows up in the door, redheaded with long red sideburns, broad across the jaw, shoulders and chest. He has got a scare with the stitches still in it across his nose and one cheekbone. His face, neck and arms are the colour of oxblood leather from working long in the fields. He looks hard. At first he is making everybody feel uneasy, with all his kidding and joking and especially with his big wide open laugh. Through out the book laughter is something really important, a kind of measurement of sanity. The other patients are unable to do more than snicker but McMurphy's healthy laughter shakes the walls. When McMurphy is laughing hard on the boat trip the Chief says: "Because he knows you have to laugh at the things that hurt you just to keep yourself on balance, just to keep the world from running you plumb crazy." (p.194) After a while the other patients are all beginning to get a big kick out of going along with him. He tells everybody that his been sent to the hospital because: "... I got in a couple of hassles at the work farm... and the court ruled that I'm a psychopath." (p.16) And the reader can easily understand that he came to the hospital only to seek an easier life. And at first the battles he fights are fought only in pursuit of that easy life. They may benefit the other patients, but first they benefit him: it is McMurphy who wants to play cards in the tub room, who wants to watch the World Series and so on. McMurphy is a very dynamic character, he changes considerably during his time at the hospital. At first he just want to escape prison and hustle the other men in poker. But then he becomes their friend and starts to care about them. He demonstrates his humanity and kindness as he fathers and encourages the patients, such as when he allows Martini to stay in the monopoly game by always landing his game piece on his own property. His mere presence at the hospital has a therapeutic influence on the other patients. He supports them and absorbs the wrath of the head nurse while the men are building themselves up. cMurphy begins to see that, against his will, he has become a hero to men who desperately need a hero. And he starts to rise to that responsibility, teaching the other patients, through basketball games and fishing trips, not to let their fears paralyse them. He consistently places himself in jeopardy for the sake of the men, when he knows it will cost him. Like when he fight for George in the shower and when he doesn't want to flee before Billy had his date with Candy, and finally, suicidally, when he attacks the head nurse. When he realise that he is one of the few patients who are committed and that his destiny is in the hands of the head nurses, he also changes and seize the furious power struggle between him and the head nurse for a while. He starts to look tired and the only thing that keeps his worn out body and spirit going is the others patients need for him. Despite the tremendous journey McMurphy makes throughout the novel, he remains a consistent character because his changes are carefully developed. They are balanced between self-servience and selfless concern for his comrades. The Chief had to kill him out of mercy and respect but his short flight over the cuckoo's nest has made influences on almost everybody there, and it will keep on doing it even after his death.$$$﻿ THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS NEVER RIGHT! Since the beginning of time the strong ones has oppressed the weak ones. It has not always been considered a crime to kill or torture a human being. But the time changes and so do mankind. This barbarian way became less usual and the killing were considered illegal. The struggle against capital punishment have been successful but only 100 of the worlds 193 countries have abolished or ceased to carry out the punishment. Sweden abolished the capital punishment in the year 1921. But several surveys in the last couple of years have shocked me and I also believe many others. Because the surveys show that an increasing number of people, and especially young persons, can consider to reintroduce the capital punishment. I think this is terrible and very frightening, and I hope this essay will show you why. The right to life is the most fundamental part of the Human Rights Agenda. To claim the right to life for innocent people is not very difficult. It goes without saying. It is considerably harder to defend people with horrible crimes on their consciences; mass-murderers, war criminals, paedophiles etc. But that is how universal rights works. They applies to everyone, everywhere and during all circumstances. Argument from the point of view of usefulness, for example that one death of a mass-murderer is better than the future death of ten victims, ignores the most fundamental value - that killing is wrong. Since killing is wrong, the fact that some States' laws recommend public murders to prevent their citizens to commit murder, seems absurd and full of contradictions. How can you show that killing is wrong and try to administer justice by killing? It is totally impossible to achieve justice by killing another person. And there is nothing that indicates that the capital punishment prevents criminality. The crimes of violence follow a curve that is due to social and economical factors at a certain point of time. It is also independent of if the capital punishment exists or is abolished. Since the capital punishment was abolished in Canada has for example the brutal crimes decreased. But it has increased in the American states where it has been reintroduced. In all parts of the world this is a punishment that mostly affects the poor people, minorities and other oppressed or already outcasts of society. An execution of a human being is an act that is known to have a brutalising effect. The capital punishment has therefore a negative influence on the people in the society where it is used. If the State consider themselves capable of killing a person in their custody, other people can interpret the killing as something accepted and right in its connection. Another argument, which speaks for itself to abolish the capitol punishment, is that every year a number of totally innocent people are executed. That is mostly due to meagre and incorrect trials. My opinion is that this can never be aloud to happen. But it does, obviously, and an abolishment of the capital punishment is the only way to avoid it. The capital punishment is the ultimate form of torture. It gives the absolute power to a few men and women to decide if a person will live or not. That kind of power can not be accepted in a democracy. It is the same thing with the right to stop an execution. That power often lies in the hands of only one person that don't need to answer for the decision to anyone. The capital punishment is irreconcilable with the Human Rights. It is also unnecessary and totally unacceptable in a state governed by law, especially a democracy. To speak for abolishing the capital punishment is not to accept cruel crimes. It is to say no to deadly violence, even the killing that takes place in the name of the law. I think, as I hope this essay have shown, that the capital punishment violates every person's right to live. And I think it is an ancient way of punishment, I like to think that mankind has developed. The question is if I should have the same view of the matter if somebody would kill a member of my family or one of my close friends. I hope I will never find out.
EE087	1	﻿ Increased Quality of Life-Something for You? Are you one of those who work eight hours a day five days a week and come home almost exhausted in the evenings? More and more of working people are under stress at work and several even have to take psycho-drugs to cope with it. Not many are able to work until retirement age, our need of rest is not provided for. While many working people are suffering from burnout there are also about four hundred thousand people that are out of work. A solution to these problems could be to introduce a thirty hours' working week in Sweden. Thirty hours work a week would be six hours a day, which is two hours less than today. These two hours the employees could spend with their family or by themselves to rest. With shorter working-hours there would be more time to look after close relationships and families would have time to other things together than the usual everyday duties. Time is a commodity in short supply in many families, which affects the children above all. Less working hours would perhaps even contribute to prevent divorces when people have more time for each other. More spare time would give people opportunity to devote themselves to hobbies or to exercises as well. When people feel that they have time to do other things than duties they will become more positive in general and we would get a more harmonious and healthy people. Less working hours would also contribute to increased equality in society since it would even up the difference in working hours between men and women. Today women often voluntary work part time to have time to take care of the housework. Over eighty per cent of part time workers are women. If six hours' work a day will become standard in Sweden, men and women could do equal work at home and women would get better positions on the labour market. Labour market would also offer more jobs that form from shortening of work. If all three million working people would shorten their workweek with ten hours, seven hundred and fifty thousand new jobs would be available. Those who have been out of work could then get a job and lighten the work burden for the others. It is obvious that work shortening favours the individual, but what about the employers and the society? It might be difficult to count the gains of work shortening in money, but in the long run I think everybody will make a profit on it. Just think about the redundant twenty per cent of the population that are unemployed and would get a chance to get into the labour market. Another example is that less tired and healthier employees lead to fewer people being put on the sick-list. This would result less sickness benefits having to be paid by the company. The employees will presumably also find more pleasure in their jobs and work more efficiently. During the short day they would not have time to be so tired or bored. Working hours and occupational injuries are connected. Most occupational injuries take place in the later part of the day when people are most tired. Many occupational injuries never pass and result in high costs for society in form of medical treatment and rehabilitation. A shortening of working hours would very likely imply that accidents at places of work would reduce and fewer people would be absent due to long time illness. The environment would also benefit by work shortening. To transform Sweden into a more environment friendly country requires time and commitment from the individual citizen, time that would be gained from work shortening. People might consider they have time to take the bus instead of the car to work, or sort garbage at home. It is about time that shorter working weeks are introduced in Sweden, it would be a gain for society in general in form of reduced costs for unemployed, early retired and sick people. For the people less working hours would signify quality of life, time for the family, increased equality and a chance to contribute to a better environment.$$$﻿ English, my English For me, English is a language and a subject in school that always has been present. Like most of Swedish youth, I have daily been hearing English language since I was a child, on the television, the radio and in music. English has been a natural part of my everyday life. I have according to this not been considering it so much. Until now I have just done my homework in school (most of it at least), but I have never worked very hard or intensive with English. I guess I have to do that this semester. The first time I was in England, when I was fifteen, I felt very insecure of my capability of expressing myself in English. I was for example very nervous to speak at the dinner table at my host-family's. Today I feel much more confident in speaking but I find it much easier to speak in an informal situation than in a formal one. If I get nervous I can feel like all words just have blown away from my head and I can hardly say anything. I believe, though, that I have a pretty good pronunciation for someone who hasn't been staying in an English-speaking country for a long time. If I have had much contact with English during a couple of weeks, for example when I have visited England, it easily happens that I have a word in English, that I know exactly what it means, which I can't find the Swedish word for. I think that is to be due to that I even begun to think in English during these periods. Although I feel that I sometimes have problem to find the correct expression in English because there are a lot of words that I don't know and feel that I need. This problem with expressing myself is of course coming back in writing. Sometimes I have to write something in another way than I wanted from the beginning and sometimes I have to leave it out. During the process of writing I also have to check a lot of words in the dictionary and this makes me feel a bit limited in writing. Writing isn't something I do with pleasure, I really had to force myself to writing this essay for example. I never feel proud or satisfied with a piece I have written and I rather don't show it to anybody. Though, I think this depends more on writing itself than the English language. It easily happens that I slip from the subject and when using the computer for typing I easily go blind for my own writing mistakes because the text looks so proper on the screen. When it comes to listening to English it is something that I feel divided about. I enjoy listening to British English and I find it easy to understand. Even if there are words that I don't know I can guess what they mean from the context. If there is a person talking with a very uncommon and strange dialect, slurring his words or has a bad pronunciation I often find it very difficult to understand especially if the subject doesn't interest me. Also when I am reading I find it difficult to understand and keep my interest if the subject is boring. But otherwise I find pleasure in reading. I am very eager to learn new words while I am reading and I use to note them and look them up in dictionaries. This often tends to get me out of track and I easily loose the story line. Therefore I often have to force myself to ignore the words I don't understand and concentrate on the story. I sometimes have some problems to get started with a book, but once I have got into the story I think I am a pretty fast reader. In all I think I am an average Swedish English student and I can't say that I am better in one specific area than in another. I find it difficult to say what my good and bad sides of English are since I haven't been able to try my skills for a long period in an English speaking environment.
EE027	0	﻿ The Mandelbaum Gate The novel The Mandelbaum Gate, is a story about Freddy, who is working at the British foreign government office in Jerusalem in the early 1960's, and Barbara Vaughn, an English woman who wants to go on a pilgrimage in Jordan. We follow Freddy and Barbara before, during and after the pilgrimage and we learn to know both them and many of the characters they meet. It is from the interaction between people in the story and from what is going on in their minds that a theme in The Mandelbaum gate is revealed. The theme could be called "nothing is what it seems to be", but I have chosen to call it identity. Identity in terms of what and who we think we are, what and who others think we are in addition to what and who we think others are. Also, identity in terms of how we judge and label people because we want to place them in the right category (if they surprise us by not acting accordingly to their category we re-label them). Identity is also a question of how specific expectations may be raised upon someone, because others identify him as, for instance, an Arab. Who am I, what is my identity? is certainly the question when Barbara Vaughn realises that "her self-image was at variance with the image she presented to the world (p 39)" This became clear to her when her friends did not see the obvious; that she was having a love affair with a man. "She understood that, to them, she was a settled spinster of thirty-seven, by definition a woman [. . .], one who had embraced the Catholic Church instead of a husband . . .". With the insight of the existing gap between her self-image, and the image she presents to others, she takes a look at herself in the mirror and sees herself "almost through the eyes of others". Thinking her appearance in the mirror really to be "quite neat, prim and unnoticeable", she wonders: ". . .but who am I? (p 39)" Well, who is she? At a convent, where she later hides for a night, she thinks of how the nuns "estimated her type" on her arrival, how she passed their judgement and was welcomed. Barbara, knowing she is "a wolf in the raiment of a sheep (p153)", feels a little guilty because "there had been a decided element of false assumption in her reception at the convent the previous day. . .(p 152)" But, tired of being judged by her "face value (p 152)" she thinks that people "believe what they want to believe (p 152). When others might have their fixed ideas about Barbara, Freddy has a problem with how to label her. His first impression was of Barbara being a "pleasant English spinster (p 16)", three weeks later he senses her "dangerousness (p17)" and later on "it had begun to gnaw at Freddy's mind that, for all he knew, Miss Vaughan might be an Israeli spy". Freddy "knows", however, what type of person Miss Rickward (Ricky) is, and he "knows" what she would not do, as he says; "'Well, he wouldn't be sleeping with Miss Rickward, if she's the woman Barbara's trying to avoid. Miss Rickward is the head of an English school, if you know what that means.' 'Miss Rickward is in the bed with my father this moment, if you know what that means,' Suzi said (p 248)." Also Barbara has ideas of what kind of person Ricky is, and why. After having received a weird letter, in which Ricky expresses her "horror" over the prospect of Barbara getting married, Barbara is confused. The Ricky-person does not make sense anymore. For Ricky to make sense again, Barbara must re-label her, and thinks to herself; "Ricky must be a latent Lesbian. . . (p 158)". There are also examples in the novel of how some people do not identify themselves as a certain type of individual, belonging to a certain type of society. Accordingly, they act differently to what their society demands. There is Abdul, older then he says he is, who whenever the situation requires, is a Muslim or a catholic (". . . Abdul had found, too, that most people took a man, in all respects, for what he said he was. (p 92)"), who lives in Israel to be free from his fathers ideas of who he should be: "Are you a nationalist? 'Nationalist of what, Father? What territory, what people?' 'I don't understand you. Don't forget you're an Arab. Are you a monarchist?' 'Which monarch do you refer to Father? (p 89)'" Abdul and his friends are ". . . the young or the young at heart who belonged to nothing but themselves, for whose temperament no scope existed in any society open to them, and who by day enacted the requirements of their society. (p 101)". If his father knew, he probably would not call Abdul an Arab. Then there is Suzi, Abdul's sister, who is so unlike arab women spiritually that her father ". . . felt he might eventually lean on her, as on a son, in his old age. (p 209)" Obviously, Suzi does not make sense as a daughter, but as a son she does. However brilliant the theme is treated in The Mandelbaum Gate, I find Muriel Spark's way of using several styles in her writing just as fascinating. A phrase like, ". . . as Freddy pushed up the street towards modernity and his hotel (p 15).", contents a lot of information without being rich in details. It reveals that Freddy is returning (his hotel) and it gives an idea of how Freddy feels, (pushed up the streets). Finally, "towards modernity", tells as much about the place he left, as the place he is going to. The opposite to the uncomplicated and few worded style would be, for instance, the two paragraph description of Barbara's state of mind; "By constitution of mind she [. . .] and the evidence of things unseen (p23)", the last sentence of fifty-some words. Another example of complicated style is "In the year [. . .] remained in force" (p 92)." Then Spark uses a detailed but uncomplicated style when she both describes how Freddy flushes down some letters, and his thoughts as he is doing it; "Freddy tore up first the letter from his mother [. . .] The last of Harrogate relics disappeared (p 138)." Describing in detail both what is really going on, as well as the character's thoughts, creates a sensation of presence. More than that, Spark manage to create a thriller type atmosphere in her one and a half page description of Barbara and Freddy going down some stairs; "He lifted the case, whispered, 'We're off!' and opened the door. [. . .] the thought of being discovered [. . .] She glanced behind and upward, [. . .] They had got away (p152)." But for different styles, Spark also uses different structures and techniques in her writing. On page 51 and a bit forward, when Freddy is writing a letter, she (once again) creates a feeling of presence by going back and forth between the letter, and the description of Freddy's surroundings and his thoughts. The main characteristics of her structure, however, are the flashbacks (from the second last paragraph on page 31 till half down page 37, we meet Barbara as a 16 year old) and the telling of events yet to take place. On page 120 ("I am told very privately. . ."), Freddy is at Joanna's place in Jordan, but not until page 127 ". . . Joanna met him at the Jordan end of the Gate and drove him to the house." Spark is at her best when she describes a moment in the future in which Barbara remembers something that has not happened yet; "'What I remember most vividly of all,' Barbara told her cousins later on, [. . .] was when I went into the wrong room at the house at Jericho and found Ricky in bed with Joe Ramdez. . . (p 191*)". Spark's way of revealing events before they have happened keeps the reader is an almost constant state of surprise. But she also withholds information to give us the whole truth later on. We have "known" Suzi Ramdez (mainly through others perspective) for quite a while when we suddenly get to hear her own story; "Suzi Ramdez always said that the main thing about herself. . . (p 208)". Again we get surprised, because new and supposedly true information is added to Suzi's character. We thought we knew her. We did not. We thought we knew Abdul, waiting for him to get Freddy or Barbara in trouble, and at the same time prove himself to be an unreliable self-benefiting jerk of an Arab, and we did not. Abdul turned out to be a rock. As a matter of fact, we did not know anybody. The way Muriel Spark manipulates us, how she lets us know that we have been "wrong" about chatacters is the true brilliance of her novel. It makesus part of the story. We are there, judging and labelling people. "Listening" to others. All, with good use of our prejudice. At the same time, the structure of the novel, in which she is even telling of events as flashbacks in moments yet to come, becomes to much to handle, and you end up wondering when what happened to who, and where. I wonder. Nothing is what it seems to be. Maybe that is the theme after all. The Mandelbaum Gate itself, a giant beautiful gate of stone. Full of ancient inscriptions, full of memories. It had to be. All the years of people passing under it. All the secrets passing with them. The messages. The relief. The fear for something going wrong. Muslim? Catholic. . No. .? You! a S p y! ". . . he came to the Mandelbaum Gate, hardly a gate at all, but a piece of street between Jerusalem and Jerusalem, flanked by two huts, and called by that name because a house a the other end once belonged to a Mr Mandelbaum (p 304)." * see above, dialogue between Freddy and Suzi (p 248)$$$﻿ NEW AGE a Trend in Our Workplaces. The NEW AGE movement has become very popular in Sweden, during the 90s. Even trade and industry have interests in what the supporters of NEW AGE call "universal" old wisdom. Background. Any interested person can find the roots of the NEW AGE movement in nature religion and oriental tradition, according to Bra Bockers Lexikon, 1988. The explorer(ess) Helena Blavatsky established in the end of the 19 th century the Theosophy during a period when the Romanticism, with exotic strains and mysticism were prevalent. The Theosophy is a utopian, religious comprehensive faith with strains of esoteric Gnosticism, Buddhism and Hinduism. The Theosophy defines, according to Bra Bockers Lexikon, conceptions which are essential in today's NEW AGE movement: reincarnation, karma, aura, and the ego. Gabriella Ahlstrom writes in "NEW AGE Vetenskap eller bluff?", Akademiker 3-1999, that there arose two breakaway groups from the Theosophy in the 30s. It was the anthroposophy led by Rudolf Steiner and the Arcane school established by Alice Bailey. Bailey was the first person who talked about NEW AGE. After the Second World War the activities of the NEW AGE movement decreased. Science and technical progress were the most important items in society, according to Ahlstrom. On the other hand were peoples' interest in the 50s in California, USA, growing towards: Buddhism, gurus and human psychology. The NEW AGE movement caught the hippies' attention in the 60s. The hippies were seekers. They were interested in astrology, Zen Buddhism, tarot, mediums and alternative medicine. The NEW AGE movement reached Sweden in the beginning of the 70s and its signification has increased during the 90s. The NEW AGE movement is today more popular than ever. The central items in the NEW AGE movement are the personal experiences and emotions. Your feelings are always right. Likewise, another characterization of the NEW AGE is the item of spiritual guidance. The NEW AGE movement is not occupied with evil. According to Ahlstrom there is no devil or hell, there are only positive or negative vibrations. Mainly, women are supporters of the NEW AGE movement. NEW AGE in Our Workplaces. Trade and industry have, according to Ahlstrom, adopted the ideas of the NEW AGE movement about positively thinking. Your thoughts have influence on your life. Many employer proffer their staff courses which are developing personality. The Swedish banker Jacob Wallenberg says in Ahlstrom's article that his company proffers their staff a kind of "mentally training", something that already has been practising in the athletics. It can for instance be to walk on glowing coal, to split plank with help of mental energy, or to listen at an astrologer or to a witch. Trade and industry are interested in good leadership. They want to develop the individual ability to lead. Consequently, they see a connection between development in spiritual life and professional economic development. Ahlstrom writes further that Telia proffers their leaders retreat courses in Vadstena because they want to give them the opportunity to experience silence and communication among fundamental matters in life. The courses are arranged in beautiful surroundings where the staff has the opportunity to meditate and talk about ethics and philosophy of life. In Ahlstrom's article Wallenberg says that we all need a connection between body and soul. It is important with emotions in trade and industry. He also says that it is possible to strengthen individuals from the inside. Once upon a time NEW AGE was looked upon as a subculture. Nowadays it is better to call it a mass culture. From Subculture to High culture. Why are the banking and other profitable companies in Sweden interested in staking money and energy on lectures by witches or to let company leaders split plank with help of mental energy? Several factors, I believe, can be important when you try to get an answer to the question. However, there are, in my opinion, two main important items; -the companies want to strengthen the individuals from the inside. When your employer stakes energy on your personality it hopefully will make yourself do the uttermost back. -the companies want the staffs' thinking to be positive. Positive vibrations are good because they make all individuals efficient. The more efficient you are the better your concentration is on your work. We have during the 90s in Sweden acquired acquaintance with crises of economy. We have also heard a lot about fusion of companies. It seems as if we have harder times economically. We have nowadays a stiff competition and only the strongest survives. Whether your company is competitive or not depends sometimes on the human factor. Anyway you could say that if NEW AGE is good for General Motors it is good for mankind.
EE585	0	﻿This assignment, to write about and evaluate my English, I find very difficult and very different from anything I have ever done before. Now I really have to think about what it is in the English language that makes it so hard, but yet so interesting. I have thought a lot about it, but I can't come to any conclusion. Though, I will try to explain to you how I feel about my English (not the English language in general), and which my strengths and weaknesses are. The English I have been learning over the years can be divided into four units; listening, speaking, reading and writing. I begin by telling you about listening. I like listening to English. It is a beautiful language, with many different dialects. Most of the listening I have done watching television or listening to music. I think all songs are better when the lyrics are in English, than in any other language. That is because English is such a flowing, gentle language without any strange sounds. I think that listening and understanding the spoken word is my best skill in English, that is of course because listening is what I have done most. Of course there is a difference between the English that you hear in an English-class, the English they speak on soap-operas, English-lyrics and serious programs on for example the CNN. The English you hear in class is often adjusted to the purpose. In the soap-operas and song-lyrics they often use slang and special expressions that all kids in Sweden recognize because a lot of these words or expressions almost have been adapted to our language. The most difficult English (and probably the most correct) you hear when you watch newsprograms or serious debateprograms on the English-speaking channels, like CNN. There they use a lot of terminology, that can be difficult to understand. But most important I think is that you understand the mening in general of what's being said, and I'm quite sure I do that in every situation. y experience of speaking English is nothing compared to my listening-experience. I haven't been abroad in an English-speaking country for more than a week, unlike most of my fellow students in the English-class. They seem to have been abroad for at least a year, all of them. I am impressed with how "un-Swedish" they sound. I feel like my very Swedish accent is one of my weaknesses. Most difficult I think it is when I don't know what to say, for example when someone asks a question, and I am supposed to answer it fast and in correct English. It's easier to get it right and to get a better pronunciation, when I know what I'm talking about and when I have a lot to say, then the words just pop out of my mouth and it probably sounds almost like I have lived in an English-speaking country. In school we didn't get the chance to speak a lot and the only real-life experience I've had is ordering food in restaurants on holidays abroad. y experience of reading is limited to the reading we had to do in school. I like to read books in Swedish and I often do, but reading in English requires much more work and too much time. If I have choice, I always read the book in Swedish. That's a weakness. When I read in English I always get irritated because I don't understand all the words, and I lose much of the thrill and pleasure of reading when I have to look up each and every word in a dictionary. I have got the exact same feeling when I'm writing. When I have found something to write about I get excited and just want to get it out, I don't want the extra time of looking things up in grammar-books or dictionaries. But unfortunately I have to, to get it right. Though, I like writing, both in English and Swedish, and that is something we did do a lot in school. Unfortunately I haven't got the time to write as much as I want in my spare time, but in my younger years I wrote a lot of poems and some song-lyrics in English. I'm good at writing in Swedish, it's easy because I write almost the same as I speak, but in English it's not that easy. When I write a sentence that feels a little strange I always think; "is that how I would say it?" or " is that what they would say on TV?", and often I come to the conclusion that it is, but then I always seem to have some vague memory in the back of my head, about some grammar-rule that says that it is supposed to be in some other way. I get insecure, and it's driving me nuts! There you have another weakness. But as I said I do like to write in English, I like to speak English (as long as I don't make a fool of myself), I really like listening to English and I like reading English (even if I enjoy books more if I read them in Swedish). It's the satisfaction of understanding an be able to express myself in an other language that I think is the thrill of English. This satisfaction and the fact that I really want to learn English I think are my greatest strengths.$$$﻿ English, My English! This is the story about my English. It will take you all the way from an English class in Sweden to a hamburger restaurant in Scotland, the road to the English language, in my heart. After eight years of English studies I should be quite good I think but the reality is different. I was always good during English class but I never had the chance to try my skill in real life until this summer. My friend and I took off to London in a big plane and landed safe on Heathrow. I hardly opened my mouth during the first hours because I didn't know what to say. As the day went by I realized that I had nothing to lose, so I started talking. Not as much as my friend but no one we met did. I didn't understand everything they said but they didn't understand my Swedish so I didn't really mind. We travelled a lot by train and we met these nice people all the time. They liked to hear our oppinion about the country and we liked to practice our English. The accent makes big differences in how much I understand. In Scotland for example, it was really hard to understand, especially when they spoke fast. I couldn't even order a hamburger without problems! The Wales accent was easier because sometimes they had a hard time with the English language too, since many people mostly speak their own language (Welsh). But I must say that it's not too hard to understand English by listening and it's getting better all the time. Television is big help I must say. Even if you read the Swedish translation you always listen to the voices too, to see how bad they translated. It's kind of fun. Problem number one when I speak English is my vocabulary. It's too small. Mostly I can find other words to use but I can't always discuss everything I want. Problem number two is that my tongue sometimes makes a big knot out of itself and I can't speak at all. Not even in Swedish. Something is a trouble word and I often happen to say thomething. I think it's easier to speak English in England than in Sweden because you hear it all the time and it goes into your blood, you start to think in English. Back home when someone speaks, it's not always pronounced correctly and then you fall into bad habits. Sad but true. Reading in English is a lot of fun I think and I always understand more than I thought I would. Sometimes it doesn't matter if the book is boring. It can become a good one just because you understand so much of what you read. It often helps to read a text twice if you don't understand it. There are always some words that you get the second time, and there are always dictionaries to help you. It's difficult though to read about something you don't understand even in your own language. A subject you're not familiar with. Then you won't even notice if you miss one or two pages. Writing in English should be easy if you only have a dictionary beside you but it isn't. You need to "feel" the language and be able to write correct sentences. I'm both good and bad at writing, it depends on what I'm writing about. It's always easy with something you like and everybody has their good and bad days. Too bad the good days mostly are when you're sitting at home and just write for fun and nobody gets to read it. But that's life. The conclution of all this is that I'm not very good at English in any way but I manage pretty well I think. I can read a book and explain to you what it's all about, I can watch a tv show and understand what they say, I can write an essay in, hopefully, 700 words about the English language in my life and I can make a conversation with someone in an English speaking country, I hope. So I'm kind of happy with that.
EE021	1	﻿ Fifth child After having read the novel "The fifth child" by Doris Lessing, I am now to write an essay dealing with two aspects of literature: setting and theme. I will describe what I see as the main theme and the importance of the setting for that theme. I will try to make extra use of the section starting "A happy Family" and ending "She had intended to sound humorous". When referring to pages in the book they are from the Flamingo version. I think that the main theme in this novel is that if you are too naive and expect life to be perfect the consequences becomes harder, when life does not turn out the way you so strongly thought it would. The main characters in this novel, David and Harriet Lovatt think that they can handle everything and when Ben is born they realise that they cannot, which breaks their dreams. I think that the author want to tell us that every person must realise that he is only human and not think that if you only live well you will be protected from every bad thing. Connected to this I also think that, by listening to other peoples' advice and not only expect them to help when it is needed, you can avoid getting stuck in a bubble that makes you think that nothing will happen to you. There is simply no connection between wish to live well and avoidance of bad luck. Harriet even blames Sarah and William for causing their baby's syndrome. "Sarah said to David, privately, that she did not believe it was bad luck: Sarah and Williams's unhappiness, their quarrelling, had probably attracted the mongol child... /" (29) The story takes place in their house, which is very big and often filled with people they like. People come there to "immerse themselves in safety, comfort, kindness" (30) I see this as a symbol for the island they live on. They never have to face reality; they choose who they want to meet and they have them in their own house. "Outside this fortunate place, their family, battered the storms of the world" (29). They are not interested in what happens outside either; they want to bring the good things inside their house. "The young Lovatts made themselves read the papers, and watch the News on television, though their instinct was to do neither" (p30) They are not only mentally isolated from reality but in some way also physically isolated. After Ben's birth the setting really changes. Family members not come to visit to the same extent and the outside world (Ben problems and his criminal friends) comes into their house at the same time as their other children look for better places do stay. They started off as a happy family (a word that comes back all the time until Ben is born) but if they had been more realistic and "been outside" their house more they would probably have been more prepared for what could happen. I believe that the fact that this story is set in the sixties and the seventies is important for the theme. They live in "The greedy and selfish sixties" which could have condemned them but they had been stubborn and guarded their individuality and chosen the best of lives. They are really out of line with the fashion of the 60s; they still have the opinion that the family should help each other and that it is natural to have many children. They say themselves "Perhaps we ought to have been born in another country". But when Ben is born they realise that the "Ben problem" is nothing that the family really talks about. In the 70s let-go raising was the normal way to raise the children. Their problems are not taken seriously; nothing is done to change the situation. Instead the family, little by little, falls apart. Harriet struggles to love her baby but finds herself in the middle of a world she so strongly rejected. The family loves them but are not willing to help when it really is their own choice to have all those children. I think that their dreams of the perfect family stem from their backgrounds. David has divorced parents, and even though they both are married David wants to do better. Harriet knows what she wants after having seen and experienced David's family. "The Lovatts were a happy family. It was what they had chosen and what they deserved" (28) Even though he never really complains you can feel that he is a bit critical sometimes, for example on p 37 where he says "My room - that was home. I find the setting important in this story. The story would have been different if taken place in another country and in a different time. They live in a time when this way of thinking about the family has disappeared. They have experiences of families, which has made them aim at something better and this has definitely made them too narrow-minded and naive.$$$﻿ Stop women's right to an abortion- to save whom? It is a frightening thought that people around the world spend all their energy trying to stop one of the most important features of modern society, free abortion. I will here defend the right to decide over ones own body as not everyone is convinced about the importance of free abortion. Of course I would like to live in a time were women only got pregnant when wanting to, but as a matter of fact, women do get pregnant even if they are careful. Of course rules about abortion are necessary, it is only a possible option as long as you can be sure that the foetus does not feel any pain and does not have the brain capacity to know what is going on. Every born child should have the right to be a longed-for baby, but this is only possible if the parents are allowed to make that decision themselves. If they, or more often she as most abortions are done by young women without a boyfriend to be there for her, feel that there is no possibility to take care of the future child, it is better if she makes this decision. I think that many foetuses now aborted, if the had to be born, would live a life that nobody would wish it did. People with handicaps are as valuable as I am, but I understand those parents-to-be that make a non-selfish decision to do an abortion when receiving the news that their child will live a life full of pain. Abortion is never used as contraception but as the final way out. Women that have gone through an abortion are not bloodthirsty and they wish there had been a better expedient. It is not an easy decision to make so why should she have to fear other people's reactions, when she probably fears her own guilty feelings more? Abortion is a question of equality between men and women. It is a fact that many men are against abortion and I state that it is because they want to retake the power over their women, sometimes hidden under the opinion that it is against God's will. I am absolutely sure that if there is a heaven aborted foetuses will be let in. When an abortion is considered it is probably because the woman will face the parenthood alone, with or without a boyfriend, and therefor she should have the last say. Men's deciding over women is nothing that can be accepted in a modern society. Women are educated enough to know what is best for them, especially as the men trying to stop her seldom is her own boyfriend but men that really knows nothing about her and her situation. Of course, there are exceptions where women are ignorant and careless and do not understand the importance of avoiding getting pregnant when she by no means will be able to take care of the baby, but they are in a minority. Will she be a good mother? What would that woman have done if there were no abortions? A very important reason why abortion must be legal is that a lot of desperate women needing and wanting an abortion will do one anyway, history will tell us the truth in that statement. No one can discuss the fact that having an abortion done by a bungler is a huge threat to the health of both the woman and the foetus as this solution made in panic not often ends well. We will end up with a woman with a destroyed inside and with a still living baby in her womb who probably will suffer from sever injuries for the rest of its life. It is thus better that this minor operation is done by a professional, in a clean operation room where psychologists are available to take care of the woman afterwards. Abortion is a necessary right if you call your country a modern one. An abortion can not be compared to murder, as the foetus is not aware of the reality and do not feel any pain. I wish that opponents of abortion would care as much about those children already in life, as they do about those who, for one important reason or another, will not face the world.
EE229	1	﻿ What can be done to reduce violent behavior? The amount of violence in society has increased in the US, as well as in Sweden. Is there a connection between what we watch on television and how we behave? According to many psychologists, there is a connection between if one has seen models with aggressive behavior, and acted aggression. This does not mean that if one sees a violent movie, one automatically becomes aggressive. According to Bandura one has to go through four steps first: "They must attend to the aggressive action, remember the information, enact what they have seen, and expect that rewards will be forthcoming." I will not go into the steps any further; the principle is that not all people are affected of what they observe. However, there has been found a clear connection between aggressive behavior, after watching an aggressive model, in the circumstances mention above. This is not the only explanation of the escalation of violent behavior, though, and probably not the most important one. If one compares the US and Sweden for example, there is similarities with the amount of violence people watch, but there is much more acted violence in the US. One reason for this difference may be the accessibility of weapons in the US. Not all violence includes weapons, though, so there must be even more explanations to the difference. If one looks at the groups in Sweden, which have the most violent and criminal behavior, there is an overrepresentation of young, males, from poor circumstances; often immigrants. They feel that they are not fully integrated in the society. These boys usually have bad grades from school and they know that there is not much of a chance of them making a career; in the conventional way. This may be an important similarity between the people in the US, and in Sweden, who have a violent, and often a criminal behavior. They feel powerless, in a society where they never really have a fair chance. To start with, we must create a society where all people have a fair chance, and where people get the support they need. Even people who hates paying tax may notice it can be money well used, even for them. Even if one, hopefully, deals with the main cause of violent behavior; i.e. the segregation in the society, there are still more factors to deal with. There is a myth that we are not affected of what we see on television. As mentioned above, there is, under certain circumstances, a clear connection with what we see, and how we behave. Children are often at home without their parents. Research has shown that many youths watch a lot of violent movies, and also advanced pornographic films. The climate at some schools, in Sweden today, is very hard. The language mirrors this phenomena. Teenagers have a difficult period in life; they have to cut loose from the parents, and their friends play an important role in this phase in life. It is common with group pressure; teenagers usually conform to what they think is the prevailing ideal. I think many of their parents would be shocked and upset if they knew what their children are watching, how they talk and behave, and what they are going through. Parents, who hopefully know what is, and what is not, a good influence on their children, have little possibility to regulate what the children should watch on television, today. This does not only apply to violence, but also to pornography. There is almost unanimity, in most western countries, in the fear of censorship. The Freedom of Speech is the most "holy cow" we have. I do agree with that, what I suppose was its original meaning, it is the most important pillar in a democratic society: the right to freely express any political, religious, or any other views, as long as it does not hurt other people. Today, however, many people are getting hurt; by the influence of violence, and as a consequence; the rawness in our society. The opponents of censorship make parents impotent to control the influence on their own children. I think the V chip was an excellent proposal. I do not find any good arguments against it, and I hope it will come to Sweden as well. Not that I think the violence on films is the main reason to a violent society, but I think that, that too, affect people, and especially children and teenagers.$$$﻿ The Industrialization in Britain: Its effects on Women and Children In the 18th and the 19th century, during the Age of Enlightenment, applied science led to many inventions which in turn led to the evolution of the Industrial Revolution. Examples are the steam power and the mass exploitation of coal; energy sources necessary for the industrial mass production. Coal mining thus became an important industry in Britain. Another important invention was the spinning machine, the so-called spinning jenny, which led to the growth of the textile industry. Many people moved from the rural areas to the emerging cities in the 19th century. They hoped for a better life, but the living conditions of the working class was very bad and they usually ended up in the slums. Women and children had been working before the 19th century but rarely outside their homes. The new industries suffered from shortage of labor, though, and everybody was needed. Women and children were often preferred, since their salaries were way below men's salaries. Laissez-fair was the doctrine of this time, i.e. it was believed that it was best with as little state intervention and regulations as possible. This facilitated the exploitation of the working class. However, as there were many reports of the horrible conditions, and as socialism expanded and trade unions grew stronger, there were many economical and social reforms in order to improve the lives of the industrial labor (Ideas and Identities, chapter 3 and 6). In the beginning of the 19th century women were not supposed to work outside their homes (Culture Kit, p. 121). They usually got married quite young and were economically dependent on their men. Nevertheless, it was the women who were to take responsibility of the family's economy. They often kept their husbands in the dark about the actual poverty, since they struggled to keep their men content (p. 8f). Working women were at this time seen as a threat to the husband's manhood. This eventually changed, and the textile industry was first to hire women on a large scale. However, to start with most women workers were unmarried, wives of disabled men, or widows (p. 13). In the 1890s it was getting increasingly common for all women, from the working class, to be gainfully employed (p. 10f). It was a male dominated world, though, and women had much lower salaries than men. Although, many women often thought that the male supervisor's treatment was worse than the low salary (p. 11f). Because of women's lower salaries they were often preferred by employers, which could lead to the unemployment of men. Male-dominated trade unions organized strikes against women labor, and they wanted to achieve male monopoly on some trades. The trade unions did not accept women until the 1910s. Yet, there were special unions for women before this time, e.g. the Women's Trade Union League (p. 13, 21f). The so-called sweatshops where common during the 19th century. This was a complement to the more modern industry. Labor, usually women, was working under bad conditions; with low wages and in long hours. While industry workers gradually got better working conditions, some employers moved out their labor from the factories to the sweatshops where the unions still were weak. This continued until the early 20th century, when the legislation of minimum wage in Britain made sweatshop production unprofitable (p. 22). There were many advantages of women working, though. By earning their own money women got a feeling of self-esteem. They often acquired some education and got married later. They got fewer children and there was also a declination in childbirth mortality (p. 6, 9ff). The latter led to expectations of the survival of the children, and the parents dared to give more emotional investment in each child. This among other things changed the view of children in the society during this time (p. 8, 10). Children were working hard even before the Industrial revolution. Most people lived in rural areas, and everyone - including the children - had to contribute for the survival of the family (p. 24). During the 19th century, however, children were used as labor in a new manner. In the harsh realities of the Industrialization children from poor families were merely seen as a labor. Children were cheap to employ and easy to manipulate. They often worked very long hours under extremely bad conditions (p. 3f). In an interview one sweeper describes how young sweeper-boys were trained to inure the pain: No one knows the cruelty which they undergo in learning. The flesh must be hardened. This is done by rubbing it, chiefly on the elbows and knees with the strongest brine, as that got from a pork-shop, close by a hot fire. /... / At first they will come back from their work with their arms and knees streaming with blood /... / Then they must be rubbed with brine again, and perhaps go off at once to another chimney (The English Social History, p. 596). The workday for the children was usually 12 hours, and there was no chance of going to school. Children worked everywhere, e.g. in the mines, as chimney sweepers, as street hawkers, and in factories (p. 4, 25). Many children started to work when they were five, but some were even younger. When the children were about 16 years old they were usually not wanted anymore. The employers had chosen the young children because of their size, their low salary and because they were easy to handle. As teenagers they then had a hard time to find a new employment, since they did not have any education or training (p. 24). Many children did not survive at all. Fatal accidents and deaths were common, and it was not seen as something exceptional (p. 3f, 24). Children who had worked under these terrible conditions often suffered by crooked legs and humped backs as adults. They had to pay a high prize for the industrial development in Britain (p. 24). There were people who tried to change the hard working conditions for both children and adults, though. During the 1830s there were commissions which reported on the working conditions of the working class in the "Blue Books" (Ideas and Identities, p 141). There had been several factory acts before this time, but none of these had been effective. However, the 1833 Factory Act regulated the working hours for children to forty-eight hours per week (p. 23). This legislation was preceded by the ideas of the factory owner Robert Owen. He improved the working conditions for his workers in many ways, and specifically stressed the situation of the child labor (Ideas and Identities, p. 144). In 1947 there was a Ten Hour Act for some trades, but in the 1870s some other trades were still fighting for a ten hour day (p. 20, 25). The British government reduced the working hours for their employees in the 1890s. In 1909 there was legislation concerning the eight-hour workday and the minimum wage (p. 20, 22). Women and children suffered hard during the 19th century. They entered the labor market, which thus far had been a male-dominated world. They worked under extreme conditions and were paid very low salaries. When socialism and trade unions gained more power at the expense of the prevailing laissez-fair, the working conditions gradually improved. The view of children changed dramatically, they worked less and were eventually offered education. The family pattern had changed profoundly in the working-class families. Women often spent more time outside their homes, they were more educated and they made their own money. All this probably led to a better self-esteem and demands for more rights in society overall.

EE022	0	﻿ From Use to Abuse When it comes to television, the first thing that has to be said is that people all over the worldare constantly using and abusing it. And in most cases it is hard to tell the difference. We can get important information from our TV, but is this information always to trust? We can have a 30 minute escape from reality, but shouldn't we focus on making something about our reality instead? I happen to believe the abuses are more and more taking over the uses, and I am truly afraid that television as we know it in our modern society is ruining mankind. Once upon a time television started out with the best prospects. It simply worked as an informationsource and as an excuse for social gatherings. TV only had a few programs to offer and it was turned on when they started and turned off when they ended. We can't call this anything but use, because this was healthy watching. It made people get together and maybe later discuss what they all had heard and seen. Of course this also made it harder to fool or brainwash people since they had a chance to reflect over what they had just been told. But the peace didn't last for long and that time is gone now. In only a few decades television has become one of the greatest threats to humanity. Today people watch TV for hours all alone. Often it doesn't really matter what's on, only it's something. All the time people of today are choosing to stay home with the TV, instead of spending qualitytime with other humanbeings. Everybody knows there's a lot of money in TV-business and also a lot of competition. TV-stations are going out of their way to create news, and therefor we can seldom really trust what we see and hear on TV. Also there is no limit to what TV has to offer. In the United States the channels and stations are endless, and probably that's what the rest of the world is heading towards too. If you want to you can spend your whole life with your TV, and there are actually people trying that. You can get all your news, entertainment, education, religion etc. from this little (or enormous) box. Most terrible though, is that little children nowadays are placed infront of the TV for hours. This means people are not only being psychologically damaged but also physically. Because while the childrens' language skills are getting worse from all this passive watching and non-stimulating environments, their bodies are getting weaker from all staying still. And these children of today are the adults of tomorrow. All of this is nothing but abuse. I don't wanna judge to hard though, since I am using this medium myself. I like being able to get news several times a day into my own home, or to watch an interesting documentary every now and then. And it can be great to rent and watch a good movie with friends if I'm exhausted one evening. But this is where I want to draw the line. This is more or less what TV should be all about. What's actually going on in our lives should always be more important and interesting than what's going on in the TV of ours. Actual people preferable to actors, and traveling to traveling programs. But society of today is going on in the shadow of television. And that is real tragic. TV is taking over our lives and not many people are even complaining. Because it's hard to find reason to complain about something that can entertain you 24 hour a day, and that is what's so dangerous about it. It brainwashes people to believe it enriches their lives. Neil Postman writes in his Amusing Ourselves to death that television serves us most usefully when presenting junkentertainment and most ill when it co-opts serious modes of discourse. I say it's all as bad. Because when the real world is no longer to prefer to a visual one it doesn't really matters why or because of what. What is important is that something has gone so wrong.$$$﻿ Evaluation - My English I think that my biggest asset concerning the Englishlanguage is my interest in it. It is that that hashelped me, not only throughout my time in school, but also when having met people from, and people living in English speaking countries. I have always learned English out of pure interest. But since I am not interested in everything regarding English, I have the weakness of totally ignoring the, often important, parts I am not equally interested in - such as grammar, for instance. LISTENING I do not think I have ever experienced any major problems in listening to English. While watching English speaking movies (without text, of course) I always understand everything. There can of course be exceptions (like, for example, when the actors speak fast, quiet, with a (for me) strange dialect or if slang is used), but on the whole I, as I said, understand everything - with ease. Things are about the same when it comes to listening to people in real life too. I think I get quite a big inactive vocabulary by listening to people, meaning that I get a feeling how the words are used. I often think a lot while listening to native speakers, trying to understand and classify every word I hear. READING Reading is something I am fond of, also in English. In fact, I do not find it much more difficult to read an English book than a Swedish one. Of course, there are many words I do not understand, but since I always (or almost always) get the main picture I can manage anyway. Mostly I even kind of understand the word, or at least get a feeling of the word's meaning. This sometimes makes me chose English books rather than Swedish ones - out of "pure interest" An exception was reading the novel Robinson Crouse by Daniel Defoe without having access to a dictionary. The use of many difficult words and the structure of the sentences (often very long sentences - sometimes stretching up to half pages) made it a very difficult book for me to read. I managed, though, something I am somewhat proud of, through hard work and with the assistance of my already mentioned interest. But as I pointed out, this book was an exception. An exception that unfortunately reduced the usual reading joy. Another difficulty can be technical language. Almost all the technical language words are hard for me to understand, and when the frequency of them is too high the whole can sometimes get lost in the vast forest of technical terms and expressions. SPEAKING I am divided concerning speaking. On one hand I havet he opinion that I am quite good at speaking English. I speak fluently and can vary my language a bit when it comes to unofficial meetings, such as brief conversations with travelling people in Youth Hostels. Since I then can make use of the slang expressions and phrases I have learned while listening to others, people (in this case from English speaking countries)sometimes have got the impression that I am an native English speaker - thought with a peculiar dialect they could not trace. On the other hand I have never had the opportunity to use English officially, I therefore suspect that I am rather worthless in those occasions. A strange thing about my speech is that my accent changes depending on to whom I speak. When spending time in England or with Englishmen I automatically get an English (or something in that direction anyway)accent. Conversations with Americans tend to make me speak in a more relaxed and American way. Not only my accent varies depending on to whom I am talking, but also my choice of words and structure of clauses. When talking to people I know are not as good as me in English, I - unconsciously - make the sentences easier by picking not so difficult words. I am somewhat afraid that these adjustments (if theyhappen too often) will affect my language. QQWRITING Since I am rather inexperienced in writing, I do not know much about my strengths and flaws. The only English texts I have produced, except the few ones written in school, are letters to foreign friends. This means that I have the same problem as with speaking - the lack of official experience. While writing texts I have often (if not always) been simplifying the language, using slang, and choosing the easiest words. I hope it has not made profound impressions...
EE506	0	﻿ Why Has the Amount of People Without a Driver's License Increased in Sweden? Various countries around the world have different laws and regulations about how and when a citizen can be a holder of a driver's license. In Sweden, the age of 18 has been effective for many years. A few decades ago it was a matter of course that a person's 18th birthday equaled a driver's license. However, something has changed in our society. Today there are many people a lot older that 18 who do not possess a driver's license. We become aware of this notable change when we realize that people in our surroundings cannot go on certain activities because they do not have a driver's license and they have to completely rely on the public transportation. Another obvious sign of this change is that people miss out on many jobs where a driver's license is required. There are plenty of possible causes to this apparent change in our society. One that is very likely is the fact that today even more people live in the cities and the suburbs where the public transportation has developed tremendously during the last decades. In places like our major cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg, there are buses and trains available almost 24 hours a day. Children who grow up with this service might later feel that it is totally unnecessary for them to get a driver's license since they are used to depending on public transportation. Not only has the public transportation developed in and around the cities, it has also increased in the country and it is not that important for people to have a driver's license anymore. Another cause of the recently decreasing number of holders of a driver's license in our country is that the driving education has been revised both theoretically and practically. Today it is very demanding and it takes a lot of time to prepare oneself for the two driving tests; one theoretical and one practical. People who are 18 years old in Sweden are either juniors or seniors in high school, depending on what time of the year they were born. No matter if they are juniors or seniors, school keeps them very busy, especially if they are on an academic program. Many students feel that they have neither the time, nor the energy to go to a driving school after the regular school day, since a driving school is just like a normal school where you have to take classes, do your homework, and study hard in order to pass the written exam. You also have to spend many hours on the roads in order to understand the language of traffic and pass the driving test. This takes a lot of time, time that people do not have or they have other priorities. The main cause, however, for this visible change in our society, is easily found in people's wallets. Throughout the 90s the entire economy of Sweden has been under a lot of pressure. People do not have as much money as they used to, and at the same time everything has become more expensive. Some two years ago a value-added tax was put on the driving lessons which led to a remarkable advance in price. Unless their parents pay for it, there are many 18-year old Swedes who cannot afford to pay for an education at a driving school. Of course there are other alternatives to the driving schools, but no matter how you do it you need to drive a lot and gas is very expensive in this country. Only a decade ago more students had a summer job and in that way they were able to pay for a driver's license. Due to the unemployment it is more difficult to find a summer job these days which automatically means that also students have less money. As a result, fewer people in Sweden have a driver's license. As we have seen there are several possible causes to the trend that less people in Sweden tend to get a driver's license. However, the causes mentioned above: more people in and around the cities, the effort that has to be made, and the economical issue, would probably together or alone, answer the question why the amount of people without a driver's license has increased in Sweden.$$$﻿ Causes of the increased number of overweight and fat people in Sweden Since 1980, the number of overweight and fat people in Sweden has increased and those who have gained weight are both men and women and of all ages. It is well known that obesity can cause complications of various kinds, such as diabetes and vascular diseases. Consequently there are many people who are worried about this trend and efforts are made to reverse the development. In order to do so, it is necessary to find the causes behind the increase and that is what this essay will be about. Why is it that such a large part of the Swedish population has gained weight over the last twenty years? There are several different reasons for why people gain weight, but not all of them can explain why the number of overweight and fat people is increasing. For example, some people blame genetic factors or pregnancy for the extra kilos they have put on, but none of these elements are new for our time period and can therefore not be responsible for why the number of overweight or fat people is rising. What we have to look at are causes which have derived from patterns which have changed over the last twenty years and here we find that one of the most common arguments is that many people today don't get enough exercise. Today, work which require much physical effort is often done by machines and robots and what remains for humans are often very sedentary tasks. Many people sit still almost the whole day when at work and so do many children and adolescents in school. There are those who think that the amount of physical education in schools should be increased, but this subject has instead been cut reduced. According to a study made by the University of Gothenburg, this reduction has contributed to the fact that so many young people in Sweden have gained weight. Not only do many people remain sitting all day at work or in school, but most of our means of transport require very little physical effort and this is also true about many popular leisure-time activities. To watch TV and to play computer-games are only two examples of entertainment which leave us as rather passive spectators. There were certainly computers, cars and other electronic devices twenty years ago as well, but they seem to take up bigger and bigger parts of our lives and technology constantly increases the choice of products. Of course, there are many people who also like to do sports and exercise on their spare time, but those who do not, are not as likely to get exercise naturally to same extent as people did a only a few decades ago. In connection with sedentary manners of living, you often find another factor which can contribute to obesity, namely bad food habits. According to an article called "Kvinnors vervikt och fetma", food habits alone cannot be held responsible for the increase of the number of overweight and fat people in Sweden, because we eat healthier nutrition now than twenty years ago. (http://www.niwl.se/hotell/ymednvso/rapport/1996-7.html) However, a sedentary lifestyle and a general faulty attitude towards healthy manners of living often come together. A combination of lack of exercise and unhealthy food can easily result in overweight. Healthy manners of living are often class related and obesity is more common among the socioeconomically weak groups in society. Claes Annerstedt, who has done research on high school students' manner of living in some parts of Sweden, says in an interview that "Students from social group one are more conscious in questions concerning health and [they] exercise and eat well." Another example which supports this statement is that 10,9 % [text lost] Since 198f all female clerks in Sweden do not perform any kind of exercise, whereas the corresponding number among female workers in Sweden is 16 %. (http://www.niwl.se/hotell/ymednvso/rapport/1996-7.html) Now, an important question is whether the differences of attitude between social classes are of any importance for the trend that we are dealing with. Although I do no have any evidence which proves that it is so, there are factors which indicate that this may be the case. For example, the decline of the Swedish economy which started about a decade ago put many people in hard socioeconomical positions and as has already been stated, that is where obesity occurs most frequently. It is therefore possible that the economically hard times indirectly contributed to the increased number of overweight and fat people. What we do know for sure is that lack of exercise and - to a certain extent - bad food habits have contributed to increase the number of obese people and we can also assume that if this trend continues, we will probably witness an increased number of people who suffer from vascular diseases, diabetes, and other complications.

EE507	0	﻿ Plastic money is taking over coins and notes The use of credit cards has increased a lot lately and has slowly started to push away the traditional trading with notes and coins. From having been confined to the hands of well-off people who used more money than could fit into their purses and businessmen who spent the company's money, credit cards are now more or less in every man's hand. As good as every shop is nowadays equipped with machines that will get money out of our little plastic quadrangles. Big chain stores have their own pay cards and you get bonus points if you use them. There are people who think that within a few decades plastic cards will have replaced all money, and notes and coins will only exist as numbers on a bank account. The main reason behind this development is most certainly the new advanced technology and our computerized society. But I am going to leave this for a moment and see what other reasons there may be. Plastic cards are efficient and easy to use. They make shopping more convenient in many ways. We don't have to make sure that we have enough cash before we go out shopping, just that our bank account is properly filled up. And shouldn't that be the case there is always the credit to rely on. We don't have to worry about standing at the cash desk with a long queue of waiting people behind us and trying to count our notes and coins to the right amount. All we have to do is hand them the card and ID, sign the receit and that is it. I wouldn't say it is much quicker than paying cash, but easier. When we go abroad it is of course even better to be able to pay with a card. First of all we don't have to change our money into a foreign currency. And when we are there it doesn't matter if the cashier tells us in French or in Chinese how much it costs. We just give them the credit card and they will sort it out for us. It must also be mentioned how much safer it is not having to carry around cash all the time. If you get robbed or loose your purse you can always block the card and you are less likely to loose any money. And another thing concerning safety is that there are in fact people who are allergic to money. Perhaps you can get allergic to plastic too, but in any case it is more hygenic with plastic cards. Who knows what all those coins which have been passed on from so many different hands have been through? After all, your credit card stays with you most of the time. I also think that prestige can have quite a lot to do with the increasing popularity of credit cards. Doesn't it feel better to hand over a shining card instead of a bunch of creased old notes? Perhaps it makes us feel a bit like that business man or that rich person. And nobody around us actually knows how much money our card is good for, it could be millions for all they know. To finish off I would like to go back to the first thing I mentioned - the new technology. I think that the prospective disappearance of money is only a natural consequence of an increasingly computerized society. And perhaps that is not such a bad thing after all.$$$﻿ The Phenomenon of Splitting of Compound Words -a causal analysis In English, we write fast food, summer sale, kitchen door etc, etc. One concept, put into two separate words. In Swedish, the system of compounding words is the opposite: we write snabbmat and sommarrea, always as one word, never as two. Anyhow, during the recent years, the number of split compounds has increased immensely in all areas of the Swedish language: mostly in advertisements and on signs, but even in running text, and the words come out as snabb mat and sommar rea. In these examples, there is no danger of ambiguity, but what if somebody writes leverpastejen "the liver" as lever pastejen - which means something like "is the pate alive"?! As we can see, the results of split compounds can in Swedish become tragically hilarious. Why is it that this phenomenon has spread so quickly throughout our language? The Swedish language writer Siw believes that it has its origins in how we learn reading and writing at school. In children's books, long compound words are often hyphenated to make reading easier, and to make the pupil see and understand the different parts of the word. Later, pupils learn to avoid hyphens everywhere except at the end of lines, they just remove them - and the result is two words instead of one. There is also a graphic aspect of the problem. In advertisements, on shop signs and other places where the layout of the text must catch the reader's eye, it has always been more excused to split compounds. But why? Do advertisers think that the message is disturbed, or even lost, with a small hyphen? So it seems. Another reason of this misuse can be that sign makers want both parts of the word to appear equally clearly. For example, in Hamn Krogen "the Harbour Pub" the word Krogen, with a capital K, is more evident than in the correct Hamnkrogen. (But I promise, Swedes are not too stupid to understand such a "long" word!) Due to this, unhyphenated words in graphic contexts have been looked upon rather mildly, and as a consequence, we now find split compounds even in running texts. We must also bear in mind the great influence of English in our whole society today. Many students get to read their course books in English, and new technical terms are coined all the time. This is a main cause of the problem with split compounds in Swedish. As I stated, English puts most of its compounds as two separate words, (though there is also the one-word concept, as well as hyphenating). Many compound words and concepts that come into Swedish today are direct loans from English, and the English two-word system is easily transferred: "fast food" becoming snabb mat instead of snabbmat, and so on. As we see, there are several possible causes of this language phenomenon. One could think it seems rather weird; fluent speakers and writers of Swedish, do they not have the knowledge to decide what is right and what is wrong when using their mother tounge? The answer, in many cases, is - no! There has to be, in addition to the causes above, another aspect: Time. Nowadays people do not have time to think of language usage. Every means of communication has to be fast and effective, and as long as the message is conveyed without misunderstandings it does not matter how. People have other, more important, things to think of than if to write one or two words - it is the message that counts. And of course, it is. But this does not mean that we have to misuse our language! Especially the splitting of compounds can lead to very mysterious ambiguities and misunderstandings...
EE505	0	﻿It was two years since I listened, read, spoke or wrote anything in English. Because of that it is difficult for me to know my exact skills in the English language. But one thing that I know is that whatever I used to know it is a bit rusty by now. In this essay I will try to explain my strengths and weaknesses in the English language and I am afraid that it is going to be more weaknesses than strengths. We are in contact with the English language all the time, for example when we look at television-programs from the United States or England. That means that I have practised my listening skills without knowing it and I think that it is a good way of practise listening. I am quite good at listening, there are only a few things that I don't understand, and if there are words that I don't know, I usually understand them in the context. But when people talk very fast I sometimes have a hard time to keep up with understanding what they say. It is also difficult to understand when the person who is speaking talks with a certain dialect, but it can be difficult to understand people talking Swedish dialect too. The listening part of the English language is one of my strengths although it is not perfect. But the more I practise the better I become in understanding, without needing to think too much. I think reading is very fun and I read a lot in Swedish. To be able to read easy in English is one of the skills that I am most eager to be better in, because reading is such a big part of learning. I read very slowly in English, much slower than I do in Swedish. This entails that when I read something in English my eyes move much faster than my brain understands the content. That involves that I sometimes don't comprehend what I have read and I have to read the text all over again. Some books are of course easier to read than others are. A book written by Sidney Sheldon is much easier to read and understand, than for example Amusing ourselves to death by Neil Postman. Reading is definitely one of my weaknesses, my vocabulary is not big enough and I have to work hard with that. When we read we are much more dependent on understanding the words because we don't have someone to ask which we can do if we are talking to someone, and when we are looking at television we can understand by what the persons are doing while they are talking. To speak English is not either one of my strengths. I think that it is due to the fact that I am afraid that it is going to sound awful and therefor I don't have the courage to speak. It is also due to my bad vocabulary which entails that I don't have words for all that I want to say. When I am with friends I can talk quite fluently because I don't have to think about how it sounds. My pronunciation could be better because sometimes it sounds very Swedish. I am not very good on speaking English right now but I will practise and I will be better. Maybe it would be better if you told me what my strengths and weaknesses in writing are after you have read this essay. My strength is that I think it is very fun to write. In Swedish I write very fluently and I hope that I do so in English as well. I know I make some grammar mistakes and that I sometimes use the wrong word order. I also think that it is difficult to spell in English because the spelling rules are not the same in English as in Swedish. Writing is also part of my weaknesses but at least I think that it is fun to write and that is easier to work from. I am aware that I have more weaknesses than strengths in the English language, but I am willing to work with them to be better. And I will always do the best I can.$$$﻿ English, my English! I have studied English for nine years at school in total and it has always been one of my favourite subjects. Knowing English is necessary in society today so I definitely think it is important to try learning it well. I actually feel very competent when it comes to listening and understanding the spoken English language. Since I have lived in England for two years I have had to learn how to understand properly. Things like getting a National Insurance number, a bank account and a job all demands a basic knowledge of understanding the English language in its spoken form. After a few months in England I discovered all the different nuances of the language and the accents that state your class, for instance. It is fascinating but a bit frightening that you can tell whether a person is working- or middle-class as soon as he opens his mouth. This is a phenomenon that we do not get in Sweden and it was totally new for me. I lived in East London and worked in Chelsea so I got accustomed to two different "languages" in the same capital - strange. There are some accents that I have difficulties understanding though, like thick Scottish and South African accents, but I am sure the best way to learn is to go and live in the country in question. Moving over to reading in English, something I have done for many years now. I regularly read British and American fiction in addition to the English music and fashion magazines that I am addicted to. Whenever I read fiction I do not tend to look up every word I do not understand in a dictionary, if I grasp the main context. I do not know if this is good or bad but it has worked for me so far. Of course I look up words occasionally but not every word. The language in music magazines is pretty simplified and much of it is jargon that I already know anyway. Reading non-fiction and complex political and financial articles in newspapers is slightly trickier for me and something I need to work on. While living in England I tried to read a newspaper three to four days a week to keep myself up-to-date. It has helped although I still feel that my knowledge of understanding formal political language is far from sufficient. Something in connection with my weak points in reading non-fiction and formal texts is my inability to write properly in English. You might have noticed this by now... I feel that it is tremendously difficult to write and express my feelings and thoughts in English. One reason might be a lack of practice - I have not written anything in English for years now. Even while studying English at Upper Secondary School I did not write much at all. Another reason could be down to the fact that my grammar is very unsatisfactory and could be improved, indeed! I always feel very conscious whenever I have to write something and when I finally do it takes me ages and so on. This is extremely annoying because I really like to write (in Swedish) and I have so many things that I want to say by writing. I hope this is something that can be improved by this A-course at Uppsala University. The last thing I am going to write about is the skill of speaking. I do feel confident speaking English, after all you would have to I suppose, living in England for two years and being such a talkative person as myself. All the words in English fascinate me (how many are there?) and the way one word can have lots of different meanings. Overall I feel that I am rather good at speaking, however, with a few exceptions including: * Discussing politics and legal matters; I guess I simply do not know all the terms regarding these subjects and feel anxious my (strong) opinions might get misinterpreted by my unawareness of this kind of language. * Arguing in English; this is very hard. Why I do not know but I never seem to be able to find the right words. I hope that this summoned up my strong and weak points in English and that it provided a more detailed picture of my knowledge (and lack of it!) of this intricate language.
EE348	1	﻿ Television - loved by the people Swedish television today is mostly consisting of Soap operas and docu-soaps and I've bin thinking about if that really is what Swedish people want to see. I do believe that it is far more dangerous to watch violent movies than to watch soap operas. Another thing to think about is whether the news on television is more or less affecting than the newspapers. I think that the television has turned into the focal point in the family and its usage increases. I think that teenagers watch far to much television and I believe that it, in some ways, can be dangerous. Young people are often easier than older to influence and if they see a "cool" character on television that smokes, maybe they want to try it too. I personally think that young people should not watch violent movies, because they can be influenced and even worse: inspired. Of course people, no matter age, can be influenced and it would be better if this extremely violent movies weren't made to begin with. There are many violent movies, for example: "Natural Born Killers" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", that gives us meaningless violence, and people love it, that is scary. There have actually bin people who have blamed the television for crimes that they have committed and I think that that is really frightening. Nowadays there is so much junk-entertainment, as Neil Postman calls it, on television. We have all these soap operas and docu-soaps which aren't "good" for anything, that is at least what I think. But I don't believe that they can affect you in a negative way, you watch it and laughs at the people who make a fool of themselves and then you forget about it. If you find it amusing, then it has fulfilled its aim, because all these soap operas and other entertainment-shows have only one purpose and it is to amuse you. Everything on television isn't junk-entertainment, we have news-programs and documentary-programs that is supposed to be serious, but the question is: are they? That depends on how we look at it, of course the news are serious but there is much around that can distract the viewer. For example the host must look fresh and healthy and wear suitable clothes and a perfect make-up. The only reason for that is that the viewer actually cares about how the host looks, otherwise it wouldn't be necessary for the host to be well-dressed and good looking. I must say that we are superficial, but that is because we are used to see only "beautiful" people on television. If you read a newspaper instead of watching the news on television you will probably read more about things that you are interested in and less about things that you find uninteresting and that is a choice that you don't have when you watch television, but I do believe that television is the stronger medium. If you see a report from a war on television that often effects you more than if you read about it. The usage of the television has increased, nowadays we can use it for almost everything. To watch teletext is only one of the usage, we can play games, listen to music in "television-jukeboxes" and surf on the internet. I think that the television is competing with the computer of being the focal point in the household. I believe that the usage of the television will increase even more in the future. There is so much to say about television that you feel paralysed by the fact that you have only 700 words to use. That shows how big a deal television actually is, people have so many opinions about it, both negative and positive. Television can be both dangerous and scary and it do affect people which we must be aware of. But television can be funny and relaxing too, in its easy and light-hearted way, and sometimes that is exactly what people need.$$$﻿ Swedish students and their education Isn't it wonderful that we in Sweden can go to universities without paying fees? But did you know that you only can get loans for six years (240 weeks) of studying? What about the loans, how long does it take to pay them back? What if you want to become a doctor and you also would like to study English for one year? That takes at least six and a half year of studying and you can only get loans for the first six years. How will you manage the last twenty weeks on the doctor's education? You can't study and work at the same time, not on a tough program like that. I thought it was good to have a wide education, so that you have better chances to get a more interesting job. I personally like to study and would like to do that for many years. I'm going to apply fore veterinary studies next autumn and then I need loans for 220 weeks. I also take loans to finance this English course. That means that I can't get loans to study, for example, English B this spring. I would also like to study a language abroad, but how can I finance that, when I can't take more loans? I personally think that it's important that people study on the university. It would be good if you could get loans for all the courses and programs that you would like to take. But you must, of course, pass your course/program to get loans for another one. At the moment the loans are up to 1062 SEK per week and the grants are 557 SEK per week. Can you actually live on that? Yes, you can, but it's often harder if you live in a bigger and more expensive city like Stockholm for example. We often hear people talk about their study loans that they still, many years after graduation, have to amortise. How much do you actually pay back? I did a simulation, on the internet at CSN's homepage (www.csn.se), to see how big my loan would be if I studied to become a vet. If I take the maximum loan (1062 SEK per week), that would, in the end of the education, be loans for 254 880 SEK and that would give me a dept to pay back at 284 041 SEK On this loan you have an interest that changes from year to year and you also have an interest that raises your annual amount with 2 per cent each year. This means that you lose money every year that you have never been given; unfortunately this frightens young people to go on and study at the university after upper secondary school. One idea is that you would get a salary from the state when you study at the university. But what if the students, after graduating, move to another country and work there? Then the Swedish state wouldn't get anything back through taxes, and would therefor lose on giving grants to the students. A better idea is to give loans and if the students, after graduating, work in Sweden for a couple of year, then they could write off the loan. I think that would make more people apply fore higher education. It also would make more students stay and work here in Sweden. For example many nurses have moved to other countries like Norway, because the salaries are higher there. I think that we on this way can get, at least, some of them to stay in Sweden. This autumn the number of people searching to higher education got lower. As I say; the state must do something to keep young people to search to the universities. If they can't raise the grants, then they at least could arrange so that your loan writes off if you work in Sweden for a couple of years. If a person would like to study for more then six years they must be able to get loans and grants for that. Don't we want more people to be educated? Then the state must do something about it, otherwise more and more people will be uneducated!
EE503	0	﻿How should I start explaining my strengths and weaknesses in English skills? Well it has been a while since last time I studied English, in upper secondary school that was. And as the years go by you seem to forget knowledge of foreign languages when not used except for a few times a year on vacation trips. Usually it is more a loss of words then of grammar skills. If you have managed to learn grammar and can understand it completely, you probably will not forget it. That is very fortunate since words, in my point of view, are a lot easier to relearn compared to grammar. Not getting to far from the actual topic I will change into discussing my own English skills. Listening I consider myself being rather good at listening to the English language. Of course it all depends to whom I listen to. Different dialects and accents can sometimes be really confusing. I am more used to American English then British English after have been staying in the USA for almost one year and studying there at an American high school. I have never chosen the opportunity to go to Britain and listen to the pure sound of British English, if there is anything called pure British English pronunciation since its various dialects. Still my English teachers throughout Swedish comprehensive school talked British English so I am used to that version as well. Reading I suppose I am at an average level in reading English texts. Unfortunately it is unusual to find me reading an English book. But once and a while, after having more or less forced myself, I read an English novel and most of the times I enjoy it. I feel I can handle the English text in most novels, at least modern ones. But English non-fiction books are cups of tea I am not too familiar with and which I rather avoid, at least I have done that till now. This kind of text is way much more complicated to understand and I have to put a lot of effort to get through the text and to interpret its message. Otherwise I find reading British music and fashion magazines quite amusing and I do that once a month or so. And perhaps it eases reading other texts in English. Writing Having plans of one day being a teacher I am aware of the importance of writing. Still this is the skill of English I am least competent in handling and which I consider being least amusing. So why does writing feel difficult to me? Probably it is because whenever you write you have to express yourself more correctly compared to when you speak. The need of a large vocabulary is definitely necessary when writing essays or creating other sorts of texts. And since my vocabulary is poor, my writing is affected by that and the result gets mediocre. I have not written a lot of essays in English, but I have been writing quite a lot of letters to American friends, even though it has been awhile since the last time I did it. And I know that the casual language of letters is nothing you would recommend using in essays. Still that is one way of practising your English in spelling, and you might learn a few new words too. Speaking The way I see it speaking is my strength and the reason I like English. By speaking foreign languages you have the ability to get to know other people and learn about their culture. In comprehensive school there is not much time given for speaking, mostly reading texts and learning words from wordlists. The first time you get to practice English by using your tongue is probably when being or meeting a tourist. My high school year in the USA made me start speaking English and gave me confidence in using it orally. Even though I believe I speak English pretty well I sometimes have a hard time to choose what English I shall speak. I used to feel more comfortable with American English, but now I am not sure. At times I tend to mix American and British English, which teachers usually are not too fond of.$$$﻿ Abortion - a crime? Abortion is a burning issue these days, evoking many strong feelings. In Sweden there is a growing movement propagating for a law restricting the right to having an abortion, and consequently there is a simultaneously growing fear for such a law. Few people can honestly say they are indifferent to the matter. It is indeed a moral dilemma, and for a woman who is in the process of deciding whether to follow through with a pregnancy or to abort it, with or without support from the law, I'm sure it is terribly painful and difficult. But I am convinced that women should have the legal opportunity to end an unwanted pregnancy, and I will here argue in favour of this position First of all it is a question of women's rights. A woman who goes through a pregnancy and becomes a mother is, physically and by means of social and cultural tradition, forced to make major changes in her lifestyle. Unlike the man, she cannot escape and disclaim her responsibility. Thus there is an inequality of opportunity between the sexes and the best way to solve this problem is to give women the right to choose. Of course I can't pretend to be unaware of the most obvious argument against abortions. I can fully understand those persons who feel an instinctive aversion to abortions. It is after all an extinction of what might have become a living human being. I want to very clearly point out that I do agree that abortions should be avoided to the greatest possible extent, and that they should definitely not be used as some kind of substitute for a contraceptive. But at the time of an early abortion the embryo is not capable of living by itself, so I think it is not unreasonable to call it a part of the woman's body and argue that she should have the right to make her own decisions about it. I also think it is important to consider what the alternative would be, that is, what would happen if abortions became illegal. It is not realistic to imagine that women would suddenly cease to find themselves in the situation where they do not want to carry through with a pregnancy. What I mean is that abortions would be carried out anyway, but under much more dangerous circumstances. Uneducated amateurs or quacks trying to perform the operation are likely to physically harm the woman, causing permanent injury or even death. In fact, thousands of women die from complications after illegal abortions every day throughout the world. If it comes down to a question of either aborting the pregnancy, extinguishing the embryo which isn't viable, and saving the mother, or having the abortion and at the same time risking a grown-up woman's life, I think the choice is not very hard to make. Obeying the law, that is, refraining from aborting the pregnancy, may also have disastrous consequences, not least for the child. Women in difficult life-situations may not have the economical, emotional or physical ability to take care of a child. Young women who become pregnant may simply not be ready to take the responsibility that is required for raising a child. A woman who has become pregnant after being raped may, for obvious reasons, not want to become a mother at that time. An unwanted child is likely to have to take the blame for its parent's unhappiness or to be neglected or abused, and lead a miserable life which it does not deserve. Innocent children have a right to be loved and cared for, emotionally and materially, and outlawing abortions would, I think, deprive them of this right. These consequences of a prohibition of abortions are rather obvious and too serious to be ignored. It is therefore important to keep them in mind when discussing the matter. Summarizing my views, I think that legislating against abortion would amount to a step in the wrong direction in the struggle for women's rights. It would also imply a direct danger to women's health if they break the law, and put the well-being of their children in jeopardy if they obey it. I think that these arguments are sufficient to show that the right to have an abortion should definitely not be removed.
EE478	1	﻿ CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: Judicial murder This essay deals with a very controversial subject; capital punishment. I will argue against this "cruel and unusual form of punishment" ( the Constitution of the United States of America). Because of the fact that this is a very complex issue, I have chosen to discuss only the most important aspects of this matter. " It is curious, but till that moment I had never realised what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we are alive.(...( In two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone - one mind less, one world less." George Orwell: "A hanging", Adelphi, 1931 The history of the death penalty speaks for itself in a way. In the 18th century, this was a spectacular event that took place in the town's square. Parents brought their children to see the criminal die. In the 19th century the prisoners were executed within the walls of the prison, with only a few witnesses, and today the executions are taking place inside the prisons with very few witnesses, and as secretly as possible. This change has occurred mainly because it is now established that capital punishment does not have an exemplary effect, and also because this is too cruel and horrible to show in public. During the 20th century more than one hundred million people have been killed by another person. This means that the human ability to kill has passed epidemics and natural disasters when it comes to extinguishing mankind. To me there is in principle no possibility of justifying capital punishment. There is something so cruel about the kind of death involved that it rules out any possibility of justification. y main reason for not accepting this form of "judicial murder" is moral. There is never morally justifiable to kill another person. One of the most basic Human Rights is the Right to Life. To me no man or woman can take upon themselves the role of God, to wipe out someone else's life. Who is that person (or group of people) who think that they have the right to decide that someone has to die? How do these people make sure that they do not make the wrong decision in some way? What if the person on trial is innocent? Between the years of 1900 and 1985 350 innocent convicted prisoners were in "Death Row" in the United States of America. 23 of these innocent people were executed before they could be released. As long as such horrible mistakes can be made, justice should not allow capital punishment. To execute someone is irrevocable and, since we can not say for sure that someone is guilty, we can not risk that one more innocent could die. I believe that Society today is to blame for the increasing rate of violent crimes, but I also think that what we make wrong we have to correct. Nobody is a natural born killer, because a killer is a product of an unhappy childhood, possibly a scattered family, and a very disturbed mind. Of course this person has committed a horrific crime and there are no excuses for this, but maybe we can find an explanation in this person's past, and in Society as well. People murdering and committing other violent crimes are people with a mental disease, and as long as people like this will continue to exist, it is everyone's fault that things does not get better. We all have a responsibility for eachother. Everyone should feel guilty when a murder is committed, because something is wrong with our world, and who can fix it if we can not? Capital punishment is not going to make things better in any way. To violate the basic Human Rights in the way the death penalty does, will only make way for more violence. Capital punishment is a kind of legalised murder, and if the authorities in a country allow this, they might as well legalize murder on the street as well. Two mistakes do not correct one of them. This is a problem we all have to deal with, and we all have to take our responsibility to find a better solution than murder.$$$﻿This essay is dealing with my competence in English, assessing the four skills of reading, listening, writing and speaking. I will try to point out my strengths and weaknesses within these different fields mentioned above. I feel quite confident about reading in English, and because I have always enjoyed reading all sorts of books since I was a child, I have had a lot of practice as well. I guess that makes it a lot easier. I read a bit of English literature in my sparetime, mostly John Grisham's books, and even though they are a bit specialised, regarding the legal-terms and some American slang, I have never had a problem with them. I have also read a few poems, and they are much harder to understand, since they usually have a deeper meaning, which is harder to grasp if you have English as a second language, though in my opinion, a poem in English is easier to read then to listen to. If I am listening to a person giving a speech in English, I usually don't have much of a problem understanding what he or she is saying. If the accent is known for me, I don't have to concentrate much at all, if the person isn't talking exceptionally fast of course. 1996 I was an exchangestudent in Australia. Their accent was new to me and fairly different from the American and British ways of speaking. I remember that in the first week of school, I used to go home having the most dreadful headache from just listening to the teachers, trying to understand just what they were saying. After a while I got used to it of course, and now that is the accent that I feel most comfortable listening to, even though I myself have gone back to a mixture between American and British accents. When speaking a different language, Swedish people are afraid that they will have a funny accent, or that they will pronounce the words wrong so that someone might find their way of speaking amusing. I am no exception. The schools that I have been to didn't put much effort into teaching us how to speak the languages that we were so good at reading. Up until High School, I had a pretty large passive vocabulary, but the active one was nothing to be proud of. Then I went to Australia and suddenly I had to speak English, because otherwise nobody would understand me, or be interested in getting to know me. I think this is the best way to fully learn a language, actually being forced to speak it, and also, in my opinion, as soon as you get over that basic fear of failing, you will see that the important thing is not to get every little word in a sentence right, but to actually say that sentence and make yourself heard! As long as other people understand what you are saying, there is nothing to be afraid of at all. Of course, I still find it uncomfortable to speak English sometimes, and I rather write my friends back there a letter, than call them, and that is not only because of the phonebill... I like writing, but that doesn't mean that I am very good at it. I learnt a lot from my exchange year, but there are all sorts of different rules how the essays should be outlined, that I don't have a clue about. In Primary School and High School, you just sit down and write an essay, and there are no certain rules or outlines that you are supposed to know about. I think that is one of my biggest weaknesses. y greatest strength regarding this, is that I enjoy writing a lot. I haven't done a lot of writing in English, but since about Grade 3 I have been writing short-stories and poems in Swedish. When it comes to writing an essay with a prepared headline, I guess I don't enjoy it as much, but it is a bigger challenge of course. To sum this up, I think my English is pretty good in these four aspects, but I guess I will learn a lot from this semester of University.
EE476	1	﻿ When reading Postman's statement I realized that television has a great influence and power over humanity and it's a shame if we should not develop television only because it has been used for commercial purposes. I think it is important to understand that television has obtained the power it has today by our lack of selectivity, ignorance and credulity and I would like to present my reflections on these issues. To begin with most of our choices in life are based on our knowledge and many questions have been asked and answered before we make up our minds. In school we learn to read books with criticism to see what is in the text, what is the author trying to tell us and so on. We have to make many active selections, for instance we have to decide who will deliver our electricity, which telephone company to belong to and how to invest our pension money. These are selections that may be of great importance for our individual future, but there are other choices we have to make that may not seem so significant at the precise moment but in the end they do have an effect on our future. Still most of the television viewers never reflect on the purpose of television and somehow we are deceived to think that we make an active selection when we zap between the channels even though the offering of programmes on the diferent channels is almost the same. We cannot excuse ourselves for not being more selective when it comes to television as we do not know that we are not; besides, many times we are just too tired to even bother. To continue we could ask ourselves whether we are ignorant and credulous viewers or not. I had not realized that so many people believed in everything that had been said on television, as if it was the ultimate truth, until I saw a debate show on television in which a girl claimed that the show Expedition: Robinson had given the viewers the wrong impression of her by cutting off the parts where she was nice. The show producers maintained that they just couldn't show everything they had filmed and that they had to select the most interesting parts which were the ones where someone reacted in one way or the other. We just can't assume that everyone believed that the poor girl was angry by nature but we must recognize that she has not become as famous as other Robinson participants. I believe that all television is directed and censored, no matter if they present news, politics, education or science; television gives us its picture the way some few producers see things and according to the market forces. This is absolutely all right as long as we are aware of it and of course we must be active searchers if we want to get the whole picture and not just one part of it. I just wonder when and where we lost our selfconfidence to question what we see and hear. To sum this up we could, to some extent blame today's society for our lack of selectivity as we are often too tired and preoccupied with other matters. We could also blame the market for being so ruled by money but the point is not to find a scapegoat, the point is that as a result of our lack of selectivity, our ignorance and credulity television has the power to present whatever and how it wants and those who want more quality programmes must buy themselves a parabolic aerial and select between even more channels. I can't say I disagree with Neil Postman when he says: "We would all be better off if television got worse, not better." but I would like to add that we would all be better off if we were more selective when it comes to television and more critical to what we watch. We could start by asking ourselves: why am I watching this, what is its purpose and what do I get out of it?$$$﻿ There are those who maintain that the family, not the state, should look after the elderly. I think that this is a socio-political and ethical topic that concerns us all. I believe that everybody should have the right to be taken care of no matter if we are rich or poor and neither should the colour of our skin and political ideas influence. Moreover, today's society doesn't really allow us to look after our elderly relatives, as we have to make ourselves a career, work full-time, bring up a family, spend quality time with friends, etc. The geriatric care can best see to that they are given the best help possible, not the family. Here below I will account for the three main arguments against the privat care of the elderly. First of all I would like to claim that this is our right as taxpayers and we have the right to make use of what we have built up. Growing old is part of most lives, and to be taken care of is not only a social right that we have, it is also a service that we have the right to buy since this service has been established owing to our taxes (the elderly do pay for the help they are given). Secondly we have the juridical aspects of it. Who is to be hold responsable if anything should happen? Could I be responsable for my mother's medical care not being a doctor? Do I have the responsability to give my grandmother the intellectual stimulation that her age requires, not being a therapist of any kind? I don't think so, just as I can't hold a doctor responsable for the horrible buildings of the seventies. Since the geriatric care is a service that the elderly have to pay for, I believe that they have the right to get qualified help from people that have the appropriate education and know how to accomodate the service to the need of the elderly. The final and third argument considers the quality of their lives. There are those who think that we need to spend more time with our relatives, so why not spend time with them and take care of them at the same time. It is true that we have lost that nearness or connection within the families that was so common some 30-40 years ago, but to give them a bath or to help them whith their activity of daily living is not the same as spending quality time with them. With quality time I refer to the social and cultural interchange and profit of people sharing time together. Anybody could help the elderly to prepair their breakfast or to do their cleaning, but only the relatives are close enough to know what they appreciate to do, what they like to read, to see, etc. We, the family, should spend more time with them to show them that we care and leave the nursing to the qualified medical service. Before I sum up this essay, I would like to stress the old generation's work and it should not be taken for granted. They were the ones to develop the Swedish welfare state and yesterday 's values, for instance, today both men and women can think about their careers at first hand, their lives will not come to an end just because they don't have children or a family. There are many elderly without relatives today and I think that there will be many more when our generation gets there, but we should still have the right to know that we are going to be taken care of even if we don't have relatives or someone to plead our cause. I believe that it's not the same to care for the elderly and to take care of them. We do care for our grandmothers and we do take care of them if we let the state look after them, after all, they do deserve the best help there is to get as they have already paid for it.
EE180	0	﻿Introduction In this essay I am going to evaluate my ability to use the English language. I am going to assess my strengths and weaknesses in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. Eight years ago I moved to the US and I stayed there for two years. The evaluation of my English is based on how competent I feel today, at this point. I must honestly say that I have lost a lot of my confidence in the English language since my days in the US and that includes all four skills more or less. The four skills Listening, is the one of the four skills that I feel most confident in, as we are being exposed to it almost everyday, especially through television. I feel that I understand most of what's being said unless the vocabulary include to much technical terms, is too academic, or if it's spoken with a lot of dialect. For me it's easier to understand American English compere to Brittish English for obvious reasons. Some times it can be a little bit confusing when, the above, use different words for the same thing. Reading in English take a long time for me since I lack some sort of reading speed, it takes a long time and for that reason I find it pretty frustrating. I studied for the teachers exam before this and some of our litterature was in English, I wasn't too happy about it then but now I'm glad because it gave me some practice in reading English non fiction litterature. Even though I may not understand every single word I usually understand the big picture. y biggest weakness at this point is the speaking skill. I don't speak fluently and I have lost a lot of my former vocabulary. That makes it hard to speak spontaniously since I have to stop to think all the time,in order to find the right words and not make so many gramatical mistakes. I also experiance some sort of confidence barrier that is hard to cross, it may also have something to do with the meeting of new people, new teachers and a new course, that sort of thing. I have the weakness of being a little bit shy when it comes to speak in front of a whole new croud of adults. I am aware though, that the only way to improve is to practice talking, so that is what I'm going to do. I think that it's going to be a lot easier when we get to know each other, at least in our groups. I still have some of my pronunciation skill left so it doesn't sound too terrible but I'm sure it could sound much better. y writing skill is about the same as my speaking skill, I have lost a lot of my former vocabulary. I also recantly descovered that my spelling was rather poor so that is someting I have to work on. Another thing is the grammar wich I sometimes don't feel too secure about. Fortunate I still write with my family and friends from the US and that has given me some practice throughout the years. Summary In this essay I have compered my strengths and weaknesses in the English language. I have devided my competence in four different skills, the skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. I came to the conclution that I need to expose my self to the language on all four skills in order to get a larger vocabulary, fasten up my reading, get more secure and fluent in my speaking. I also need to study the grammar rather thoroughly. I think I will have the opportunity to practice all of this in the upcomming course and I'm locking very much forward to it.$$$﻿As this is to be an essay on a given topic, how competent I feel about my English considered four specific skills, I will here in the beginning briefly mention these four skills or parts and why I decided to go through them in this order. The four parts are listening, reading, speaking and writing English and I will go through them in this order because it reflects my English pretty well. The two more passive parts of listening and reading I use more often and therefore have more to say about than the more active parts of speaking and writing. And since I've never written an essay like this and really don't know how it is supposed to be I guess I'll just write down why it is like that. So, to start with listening to English. In the early eighties a small group of neighbours got together in Bolsta where I lived. They bought a satellite dish and soon, Bolsta being a very small town, everyone who wanted could receive satellite television as the company expanded. For the first time I had use for all these unnecessary lessons I had gone through in school to learn a new language. Of course Swedish television showed programmes in English but as they always were subtitled, why bother to try and keep up with what they said when you knew that you surely after a while would miss out on something. There was always someone who talked to fast or to blurry, at least for me. But now I had to try and keep up and learn because there was no text and that I think is why listening to English is my biggest strength considered all these four skills. I have done it longer than the other three and you don't always have to understand every word to understand the general meaning of something. The same thing is probably my weakness, it doesn't really matter whether you miss a word or not. As long as it's not a very crucial word you can be lazy and leave it unknown. Listening while you are in a dialogue with someone is a bit different and usually gives you the possibility of asking or having things repeated to you. So, I'm lazy, which is a weakness when it comes to my reading English as well. When I'm reading a novel or any fictional literature it doesn't matter to me if I skip over a word every now and then. If I just understand the, again, general meaning of the text I usually don't bother to look up a strange word in a dictionary. To often the word is never that important and if you are just reading for fun the dictionary is just an unwanted interruption. That is my biggest weakness when it comes to reading. My strength is on the other hand that I've done quite a lot of reading in English. I've studied Philosophy and Literature before this and especially in Philosophy most of the courseliterature was written in English. And since I was studying I couldn't just leave out unknown words and thus learned some new words, words that I honestly never use and many of them I'm not even sure how to pronounce. Which brings me to the third skill, speaking. When I was 20 years old I went to Switzerland to spend the winterseason in a small skiresort. Two years later I went back for a second winter and both times I lived with English-speaking people. So I used the language every day and by time I lost the fear, shyness or whatever you might call it of speaking English. That is probably my strength when it comes to speaking English. Although I speak far from good English I know that I usually can make myself understood. The weakness is that I use the language to seldom. Except from an occasional vacation abroad now and then I never speak English. I have no regular contact with English-speaking people and this weakness is also true about writing. Basically I never write anything in English. Except for what I might have written in English in "high-school" this is the longest text as far as I can remember. So I really don't know what my strengths and/or weaknesses could be. Writing this I have found out that I'm lousy at spelling but apart from that I don't know and therefore I guess I'll have to leave that evaluation to the person who will read this.
EE181	1	﻿ Doctor Spivey-a friend of the inmates Through out Ken Kesey's novel "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", the inmates' lives are controlled by the strict and non-accommodating Nurse Ratched. Side by side but in the shadow of the nurse is another member of the staff who always tries to comply with the patients and that is Doctor Spivey. The aim of this essay is to give a clear description of Doctor Spivey's character. Before Doctor Spivey was engaged on Nurse Ratched's ward her doctors had been of short duration, and that indicates that this man has something special; something that Nurse Ratched can manage. Doctor Spivey is a little man with a peculiar shape of his head; all parts of his face are small. His minute eyes are situated very close and his nose is tiny which means that he has a problem wearing his glasses properly. When Doctor Spivey talks he frequently has to turn his head to keep his glasses in the right place. He keeps his glasses on a string and he always finds it difficult to find them and to get them on in time. In contrast to Nurse Ratched, Doctor Spivey is always very polite towards the patients. He is interested in what they have to say and he expounds conversations with honest questions, which makes the patients feel good and important. Doctor Spivey is human. "He's smiling a little as he turns through the folder, just as tickled by this new man's brassy way of talking right up as the rest of us, but, just like the rest of us, he's careful not to let himself come right out and laugh." (p.45) Doctor Spivey does not have the ability to hide his emotions behind a face of iron, like Nurse Ratched does. The patients can always tell if the doctor is happy, sad, or nervous. Doctor Spivey feels very insecure when he has to talk in front of the group and Nurse Ratched. He does not know how to handle a situation where he is in the center. "The meetings are uncomfortable for the doctor unless he's talking about his theory; he'd rather spend his time down in his office, drawing on graphs." (p.53) Doctor Spivey understands the, and they understand him because they have a lot in common; Nurse Ratched is in control of all of them. "He's maybe got more to say, but about this point the Big Nurse usually hushes him." (p.49) Doctor Spivey is very amendable and he never voices his opinions, and that is how he has been able to manage this long on Nurse Ratched's ward. The patients who have been on the ward for a long time do not blame the doctor because they know exactly how the situation is. "The rabbits accept their role in the ritual and recognize the wolf as the strong." (p.60) Of course Doctor Spivey and the patients are the rabbits and Nurse Ratched is the wolf. cMurphy's arrival at the ward is an upswing for Doctor Spivey. At once McMurphy can tell that the doctor is the one member of the staff who will listen, and that he is easy to get along with. McMurphy makes the doctor laugh and he encourages him to be brave and to suggest ideas in front of the group and Nurse Ratched. Doctor Spivey's self-confidence grows when he realizes that the group is supporting him, about the idea of a carnival on the ward, and this makes him talk with eagerness and enthusiasm. Suddenly the doctor feels exhilarated and for a moment he really believes that this wonderful idea will come true. He speaks with such conviction like everything is already decided and settled. It takes one look from Nurse Ratched and the doctor's dreams are dead. "He describes games, booths, talks of selling tickets, then stops as suddenly as though the Nurse's look had hit him right between the eyes." (p.98) Doctor Spivey is afraid of Nurse Ratched just like the patients are. He never talks back to her. She makes him feel like he is not worth anything, like he is dumb. However, the doctor gets a new chance and also this time McMurphy is the cause of the doctor's interest in the patients' request about the radio and the old tub room. This time Doctor Spivey's idea becomes a fact and he is so pleased with himself that he seems to have forgotten that it really was McMurphy's idea. Doctor Spivey sees this as a victory. He feels that he himself has managed to do something important for the patients, and for himself. He made a decision that Nurse Ratched did not overrule. Doctor Spivey is scared and insecure but he can be tough too, and he always takes up for his patients.$$$﻿At the age of 20, I now look back at my English studies and it seems unreal that ten years have gone by since I was in the 4th grade, which was my first year of English. I can still remember how we sang "John Brown" and practiced the colors by writing a book. Everybody also had to choose a name from an English speaking country. Most of my classmates had a name from the American soap opera "Dallas", such as Pamela, Bobby, and Jenna. I was called Patricia, a name, which my mom came up with. These are my first memories from studying English. In elementary school, English was more a game than a subject and I loved it. In middle school I started with German and I felt that my English was neglected, which really worried me. German was hard but very logical and I knew and understood the grammar. I could tell the German prepositions in my sleep, whereas I did not know anything about the English prepositions. After middle school I began to dream of a school year abroad. I made up my mind as I started high school, not only because I was worried about my English skills, but also because I longed for adventure. Thanks to my parents this dream became true in 1996. After my second year of high school I left for Indiana, U.S.A. My question for this paper is: what have I learned during these ten years of studying English? Which are my strengths and weaknesses in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing? As a result of my school year in the U.S. my ears have become very familiar with the sound of the English language at an everyday level, especially American English. My time abroad forced me to really listen and pay attention to what people said. Since everything was in English I learned just by living there. I do not have a problem understanding spoken English at an everyday level, but I am very aware of the differences in levels and I know that I still have a long way to go. When it comes to reading the school in Sweden spent quite some time on that, at least at the high school level. Studying in the U.S.A. I also had to do a lot of reading, which I sometimes found difficult, especially in classes such as government and economics, since there were so many terms that I was not familiar with. I do fine reading novels and I have learned to use the context when there are words that I do not know. I enjoy reading novels in English, but I find it harder to understand shorter texts. Perhaps I need more information to really get it. A time limit stresses me and I tend to read too fast; that is probably why I have a problem with short stories, and I never did as good as I wanted to on reading and comprehension tests in high school. Due to my time in the U.S.A. with the Americans my spoken English developed tremendously. I did not realize how much my school English had changed until my sisters came to see me; I had then been in the U.S.A. for one semester. Listening to their English I understood that my English had been given an American touch. I learned to use new words and speak although I was not sure that it was correct. I came to the point where I allowed myself to make mistakes and I let people laugh at me. Sometimes my tongue really got twisted and I said the craziest things, yet my mistakes taught me more than I would ever have learned if I had been quiet. Speaking English sometimes makes me nervous, and in a strange way I feel more relaxed speaking English with, or in front of, English native speakers than I do with my countrymen. Writing is the skill in which I have not had very much practice, not even in the U.S.A. since the tests were always made up of matching or multiple choice questions. My third, and last, year of high school in Sweden I took a class called "English C" and there we actually practiced writing. We wrote formal letters, personal notes, leaflets, and book reviews. I get a lot of practice by my own since I have so many friends in the U.S.A. to whom I frequently write letters and e-mail messages. A big problem that I have when I write is that I neither feel comfortable with my spelling, nor my grammar. In other words: I really need more writing exercises. Finally, I want to point out that I have learned a lot during these ten years but still ten years is a long time and I feel that I could have learned more than I did. My year in the U.S.A. has given my English an American touch and it also gave me the willingness to study English at the university. I can listen, read, speak, and write English at an everyday level. I can survive and live a normal life in an English speaking country. However, I want more that that and I know that the way is long!
EE341	0	﻿ Evaluation In this essay I will try to assess my strengths and weaknesses in the English language and evaluate them. I will try to reveal my personal thoughts about my knowledge and understanding of the English language. Listening, is my biggest strength when it comes to the English language. During a one year stay in Australia I learned to be more relaxed listening to people speaking. I do not feel that I have a problem understanding the spoken language, not when attending lectures nor when listening to an English spoken TV-show or radio station. Of course there are some words that I do not know but that does not mean that I can not understand what is being said. Depending on the situation my understanding varies. Different English accents can be hard to understand sometimes, however I mostly understand what is being said if I am concentrated. Listening to a documentary about the industrial revolution I might not understand all terminology even though I get the context. Overall I feel rather confident about my ability to understand English. When it comes to writing, my self esteem is not very high. I do not have a problem with writing but I do think that it is quite difficult. I have very big demands of myself and even though I know I have improved my writing skills a great deal over the last few years I am not yet satisfied with my work. On the other hand I would not be on this English course if I already knew the language as if it was my mother tongue. I need to extend my vocabulary and I need a great deal of practice in order to improve my writing. I can write my journal and personal letters, but I would also like to know how to write formal letters, reports and articles in a proper way and what rules to apply. Similarly to my writing skills I am a bit insecure when it comes to speaking. I used to be able to speak relatively fluent after spending almost one year in Australia, yet after five years in Sweden, hardly speaking any English at all I have lost that fluency. Fortunately I think that the English language will come back to me when I start speaking more. I believe that I am sometimes too afraid to say something grammatically wrong or using the wrong word, that I do not say anything at all. I realise that this is a problem since nobody can learn to speak a language properly if just sitting quiet being afraid of saying the wrong things. I tend to think that everyone else knows the language perfectly, which of course they do not, I realise that but I only see my own weaknesses and tend too see other peoples good sides not the bad. When it comes to myself I far too often focus on my weak sides instead of the strong ones. Finally reading is a skill I feel rather confident in. I do not find it difficult reading literature in English although I know that my vocabulary is too small. Learning more words is something I need to do in order to be able to read faster and get a more precise understanding of a text.. y abilities in the four different skills in English varies, I feel confident in listening and reading but I need a great deal of practice when it comes to writing and speaking. No matter how I feel about my capacity I know that I have a lot to learn before I become proficient in these skills.$$$﻿ English, My English! When I started learning English at the age of nine I used to rank it as the absolute worse subject on the schedule. My dislike of the subject went so far my teacher one day told me, very harshly, it was quite enough. My comments and attitude influenced the other children in my class and I was to keep them to myself. Throughout my years in school I came to like it more and more. It never got to be one of my favourite subjects but nevertheless, I could endure the lessons and even appreciate what my first teacher had tried to taught me. Still today I can recognise the same feeling, I had as a nine year old, going through grammatical terms trying to understand the true essence of the language. I can fortunately ignore it since I know I will have a lot to gain learning it. I wish I one day can feel as though I am fully taught and that there is no obstacles in talking, reading or writing English and this is what I want to achieve this term. Having studying chemistry and biology at university for five years it seems to me I am well accustomed to the English language in certain situations. Most of the literature I have read has been in English and some of the courses I have had have been held in English so that students from other countries could attend. When it comes to listening I usually do not have any problems understanding what is said provided I am familiar with the subject. Yet, I can not guarantee I understand more than bits and pieces of a discussion between two physicist scientists. What limits me in my listening and understanding of English is my vocabulary. The same goes for my reading. I have read a substantial number of books in the fields of biology, environmental hazards, chemistry etc. Reading a book in either of these subjects do not trouble me since I already know the meaning of most of the words used. What I want to emphasize is my need to learn the meaning of more words used in all kind of fields, not just my own. Being from Sweden having, Swedish as mother tongue, inhibits me learning and using a new language. Writing and talking, I unconsciously use Swedish phrases and clause constructions. To an Englishman it becomes clear, perhaps not at the start of an conversation, but certainly after a while that English is not my language by heart. I often know how to pronounce words right when talking but frequently has to stop in the middle of a clause to get the word order right. In writing this is a even bigger problem since I then have more time reflecting over what I have written. Another thing I like to improve having to do with both writing and talking English is how to use the proper word for what I want to express. To explain what I mean I will illustrate it with an example. The year after I finished high school I went to England to work in a family as their Au Pair. My Au Pair mother used to ask me how my evening out had been and I usually replied "It was funny", meaning I had had a great time. She, after a couple of months, explained to me that that was not the correct way of saying I had a great time because to say that something is funny you mean it is kind of strange or odd. I assume that there is a lot of words like the one in the example in my vocabulary. That is, words I use in speaking and writing English without knowing their true meaning. The way I want to express myself writing and speaking English is frequently effected by my lack of confidence. If I hand in a paper and the teacher corrects it I usually rewrite it the way he or she wants me to. Very often it might not be necessary, the way I expressed myself might have been one way of doing it. The same goes for speaking English. I often hesitate getting involved in a discussion because I am afraid that what I say might sound wrong or contain grammatical errors. What I am trying to accentuate is that even if I know English quite well I still feel insecure using the language. By reading this university course I hope I will achieve a better knowledge of the language consequently will get more secure using it in different situations.
EE508	1	﻿ "Why spoil a good mother to make an ordinary grammarian?": Nineteenth Century Attitudes to Female Education Education for women was a widely discussed issue in the nineteenth century. The main questions were whether female education was justified or not, and how it, if justified, should be implemented. These discussions mostly concerned middle- and upper-class girls, whose education was unsystematic and disorganised. Schooling for girls was often more of a social than of an academical nature. Girls were taught to be good hostesses and to be desirable for their future husbands. They learnt basic language skills, arithmetic, embroidery, dancing, and playing musical instruments. There were many opponents to extended education for women; people who wanted to keep things the way they were. Their adversaries were reformers of different kinds, established middle class families, and, of course, feminists. Both groups had much to say in these questions. The arguments were often based on ethical, social or medical ground. In this essay I will give an account of some different ways of thinking in the matter. It is necessary first of all to consider the ordinary woman's situation in the nineteenth century. She was merely supposed to be a beautiful, caring and supporting creature. She should get married and take care of her husband, their home and their children in an unselfish way. These facts made the basis for many of the social and ethical arguments against female education. For one thing it was said that girls would never find use for the knowledge they gained at school in the following life, with the womanly duties which would occupy their lives. In this sense female education was nothing but a waste of time. Regarding the self-denial which a woman should possess, schooling was an evil. Intellectual skills led to the process of raising oneself above ones companions, and that was certainly not what a good house-wife was expected to do. Also religious approaches to the matter were made. Attention should not be paid to a woman's well-doing. It should be done in love of God, and the reward she would get was knowing that she had done a good deed. The opponents of education for women stressed that the ideal of womanhood would be destroyed by education. From this point of view the best environment for learning girls what they needed for their future lives was in the home, and the best teachers were their mothers. On the other hand, those advocating female education argued that boys needed an educated mother in order to be encouraged in their mental development in a satisfactory way. But education was also a question of money. For families with financial difficulties for educating their children it was more important to send sons to school, and spend less money on their daughters' education. Disagreements arose also in other areas. In the British society of this time it was very hard for middle-class women to find jobs, and they were totally dependent on their husbands. This, among other things, made many people think positively about providing schooling for middle-class girls. One argument to do so was that some middle-class women actually needed to earn a living. The women's colleges that were opened in the latter half of the century, showed that women were capable of studying at the same level as men, without gaining any damaging effects. But many people, even among those who understood the importance of education for women, thought that the separate spheres for men and women should be kept distinct, and that women should therefore only work in their own sphere. It was feared that if these spheres were destroyed, this could create a disastrous turbulence in the relation between the sexes. It was also said that women should be protected from hard work, in order to give them their rightful treatment in a high civilisation. In addition to these arguments medical ones were also used. It was pointed out that women had a different way of thinking than men, and that they were physically the weaker sex. Women had a sensitiveness and intuitive power, they were insightful, but they lacked depth, ability to concentrate and power for reasoning. This was generally thought to be an obvious observation, and there were not many people who disputed this analysis. The debate that followed, however, treated the question whether this difference was inherited, or if it was acquired through different treatment in society. Studies were made in the field. This was often done by comparing brains from different people, and by weighing and measuring skulls. It was claimed that a small skull was a sign of less intelligence than that of a large skull. From this it was deduced that men had developed much more from the ape than women had done. Hence higher education was not valuable to women, and it could even be physically dangerous for them. Women could become incapable of producing children, it was said, and their beautifully shaped foreheads were in danger of being altered, all because of education. Other conclusions were that the differentiated roles of men and women were only evidence of a high civilisation, and that man and woman cannot be born equal, since women were not superior to men in any known human society. As we can see, there was a large controversy in the question of female education in Britain in the nineteenth century. We all know that the conditions for female education eventually changed, but it was not done without resistance. In an essay like this an imbalance might develop, as there seem to be fewer arguments for female education than against it. But those mentioned are important ones. The arguments of the opponents are easily noticed. They are very different from the views that most people hold today, which makes them interesting. The thought that women should compete intellectually with men was ridiculous to many people in the nineteenth century, but there were also those who stressed the importance of developing a better system for female education.$$$﻿ Just a few years ago I felt quite confident in my knowledge in English. I had read English in school since I was ten years old and I had travelled quite a lot. I thought that I mastered the language pretty well. But what has happened since then? How have my skills in the English language developed during the last three years? Starting with my skills in speaking, I must say that I have hardly spoken English since I left school. This is something that makes me feel nervous and insecure every time I try to speak English. I always want the words to come out right and to be able to speak fluently - and probably just because I want to so hard to speak properly, I tend to stumble instead. I often can't find the right words and I have a hard time trying to figure out how to put things. I seldom know whether what I say is grammatically correct or not. I like making speeches, though, and using the language - both Swedish and English - to express myself. Despite this fact, I get nervous. I think it's because I'm a bit shy, afraid to show other people what I can and can't do. I have overcome this fear pretty much when it comes to speaking in Swedish, so probably it's just a question of getting used to the English language. Another thing is my accent. When I was in the eight grade I was in London for a weekend. At that time people said to me that it sounded like if I was born in England, - no wonder -, I had learnt British English "all my life". Since then, though, I have spoken English to Germans, Americans and people of several other nationalities during competitions and trainingcamps abroad. On the television I have mostly heard American English. I guess I'm quite confused - do I speak American English or British English, (I hardly know the differences,) or is it something totally different? Also when it comes to writing I feel that I have forgotten about how it's done. I have the same problems with finding words and with seeing the linguistic correctness as when I'm speaking. Of course I don't feel nervous in the same way, because I know that I can always stop to think and to look up words. I'm sure that one can easily see in my writing that I'm from Sweden. I have a tendency towards thinking in Swedish and then trying to translate my thoughts directly into English. That doesn't always turn out too well... To my advantages, though, I can say that I'm a fast learner, and that I usually don't think that spelling is a very big problem. Listening to and reading English are two skills that I have used a little bit, also during recent years. I haven't travelled much lately, but I often hear spoken English on the television. I think that both my listening and my reading abilities are rather satisfactory. (That is, of course, when the language isn't too advanced.) Even if I don't understand all of the words, I can usually see the context, and understand most of what is said or written. In high school I studied the A and B-course in English as compressed courses, which means that we only studied English for the three first terms in high school. I really think that one learns the language better if it's taken continuously during the whole three years of education. You need some time to digest the information and to practice the language for a longer period of time. The way we did it I felt that when I graduated I had almost forgotten ever reading English. I think that this is one thing that have affected my knowledge in English (words for an example) a bit negatively, compared with how it would be if I had read it for all three years. To sum up I can say that what I need is to learn more words and grammar, to read and speak a lot, to get more secure, - in short terms; to practice. And I guess that practice is what I'm going to get this term, while reading English A1 at Uppsala University.
EE556	0	﻿ English, My English Introduction This essay shows upon the strengths and weaknesses of my English, divided in four skills: listening, reading, speaking and writing. I have in certain areas presented a solution to my problems, my weaknesses. I've also mentioned what I want to acchieve with this course and what to do with my acquired English. Writing I've always been better expressing feelings and thoughts in the written form than in spoken word. I think the reason is that when I write I can take a break from the words and come back later and correct the wrongs, use different words and phrases, really think through what I want to say, one thing you can't while you are speaking. But as I write as I think, and think as I speak, the words doesn't always come out right, grammatically and spellingwise. When I write poems and lyrics a fluid language and knowledge of the words is very important. So, even though grammar is very difficult and sometimes incomprehensible, it is of extreme importance that I study it thoroughly. Speaking y heart throbbing at the speed of light, face turning red, and self-confidence getting weaker by each heartbeat. That is how I would describe myself minutes, seconds before I am to speak in front of a big crowd. Since English isn't my native tongue, my fluency, along with my limited vocabulary, is the bigggest problem. The lack of word knowledge, knowing the Swedish words in English and the right way to use it, I feel is very hampering when expressing my feelings and thoughts. I also found that my thoughts differ from my words, so the spoken word is something that I don't master at this point. I can only hope that it's something that I can improve, that I'm not stuck with this social handicap. To improve on my pronunciation I'm reading out loud from and old Time magazine, practising my accent. I have found that Swedes often tend to talk with an American accent, which I find sometimes irritating and sometimes amusing, imitating their heroes in Beverly Hills, 90210 or Days Of Our Lifes or some other TV-series. My goal is a mix of Peter O'Toole, Malcolm MacDowell and Alan Wilder (former member of Depeche Mode). You can call it a slightly overclass, old-fashioned English accent. Listening When the subtitle is removed and I have only to rely on my ears listening, instead of my eyes reading a text, I usually understand everything except for the odd word here and there that's not in my vocabulary. Where I'm staying at the moment there is a English newschannel that I've started watching, so I not only listen to English, I get up to date what's happening in the world from an English point of view. The best thing would of course to spend some time in an English speaking country. To really dig into the language, discovering the little nuances that separate the native from the tourist. Reading Except from one or two books read in high school, my reading habits has been limited to Swedish books. But as a part of the literature course, I've read two short stories and a novel and beginning on another. I've also borrowed three books by P.G. Wodehouse, finished one and halfway in on the other. Since the language in the latter books is old-fashioned and filled with lots of upperclass slangwords the big picture is rather clear, but the details that increases the understanding of the text is harder to grasp as they don't turn up in the dictionary, being short for something or having a different meaning than usual. Conclusion I have to improve my speaking, mainly in large groups. My writing must be improved upon so my lyrics and poems reaches the level of accuracy that I want. That is my primary goal with this course, to improve my writing. So grammar is something that I have to study with the utmost attention, how boring I may seem. To achieve a larger accuracy writing English, reading books and listening to English programs is a step in the right direction. Constantly being exposed to the country's language is the best way to acquire another language.$$$﻿ Evaluation English, My English I remember my first lesson in English at intermediate level in school. We were told the most basic words and phrases, and my teacher wanted me to give her a pencil. So I did and said "Here you are" as we had been learned to. She said I had said it with a perfect accent. Walking home from school that day, fascionated repeting those phrases, I decided to learn this language well. Ever since intermediate level I've had pen pals from England/USA/Canada et cetera, and I still do. It's fascionating reaching people and making yourself understood, only by knowing/learning languages, especially English. This became very clear to me when I could write letters to a Greek girl in a language neither of us spoke every day, and still be understood. We still write to each other. I soon favoured the brittish accent, since I read and saw the screen version of the books by Jane Austen, Charlotte Bront et cetera. Therefore I hope to improve my accent and not speak American English too. In senior level we had a great teacher in this subject, who taught us a lot. I do think the teacher means a lot of your improving in this subject, as in any maybe, because in upper secondary school the teacher brought us nothing new and wasn't as enthusiastic for what she was teacing in and I didn't learn a lot from those lessons unfortunately. y dream of going to England came true when the first year in upper secondary school was finished. My friend and I went to Kent and worked on a farm, picking and packing strawberries. It was awful work, but everything else was wonerful and more than I ever expected it to be. I remember the first conversations I had with English people. I felt I had so much I wanted to say but it didn't come out of my mouth. It started with a few sentences, but soon it all went well, and in the end of three-week-period we naturally spoke English, even between us. But some words was of course in Swedish. I really loved beeing in England, talking to the other youth working there. There were English, Scottish, Irish accents. A few came from America, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. I was really improving my speaching there. We also went to London afterwords but there we questioned more than discussed. In the second year of upper secondary school we had a girl from New Zealand in our class who became a good friend. I learned more from her than from the English lessons. About my English today I would like to improve a lot of things. I love reading books in English, though I would like to check the difficult words now and than, because I want to improve my vocabulary. This takes a lot of time and interrupts the reading and when I don't find it very difficult understanding it without cheking the words I suppose that's the way I should go through books. Without using the dictionary all the time. The main reason I don't have a good vocabulary, I believe, is because I'm deaf in one ear. Therefor sometimes listening is a problem for me. People often learn words just by watching television, passive learning. I can't, because I need silence around the one who is speaking. The writening I really do like and maybe it would be an idea for me to change language in my diary to English! This course will hopefully ameliorate my writing, which is very important if you want to do a perhaps scientific essay or something. Acctually writing good will always favour you. I don't find it uncomfortable to speak with people in English, but I don't like to hold speaches. But holding speaches isn't what I like to do in Swedish either. y expectations from this course are mostly to write good essays with a good English with good grammar, and to learn a great number of words. I'm sure I'll get a lot of other good things out of English A.
EE297	1	﻿ "The argument has commenced. ... Slavery will every where be abolished, or every where be re-instituted." In 1619, the first Negroes arrived into America. They were not "real" slaves, but so called indentured slaves, which meant that their owners paid their trip to America if they in exchange worked for them some years. They then became free. Both blacks and whites where indentured slaves in the beginning. The whites soon found out that slaves were cheap labour and after the 1660s slavery became a fact. Since black slaves were cheaper to buy, they became more popular. Both the South and the North used slaves, but after the Revolution slavery became restricted in the North. The South, however, wanted to keep the slavery and argued that the system was necessary to maintain the agricultural society since it depended on its cotton. In 1808 the slavetrade was made illegal, but the Southerners still managed to keep their slaves. In the mid-nineteenth century slavery was a burning issue and both sides had a lot of arguments. In this essay I will give an account of the arguments presented in the articles. There were many more arguments for slavery than against, but on the contrary are the arguments against slavery much heavier, which might correct this imbalance. During an anti-slavery convention in Nantucket in 1842, Mr Frederick Douglass, a former slave, spoke about his experiences as a slave. Mr Douglass also wrote a Narrative in which he tells the reader about the ways he had been treated in as a slave. He explains how the most masters wanted their slaves to be as ignorant as possible, how children were taken away from their mothers and how the slaves generally were sold and treated as goods. In the preface of this Narrative there is a story about a white man who was kept in slavery for three years. After those years he had already forgotten his language and had lost all his reasoning power. "It (slavery) has a natural, an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man. ... So much for the humanizing influence of THE DOMESTIC INSTITUTION!" (Garrison 3), Mr O'Connell has said according to Mr Garrison. They meant that it was not the slave who had a lack of intelligence (which some of the advocates of slavery said), it was the slavery that made him like that. Neither could Mr Garrison understand how a man who claimed that he believed in God and what Christianity stands for in the same time could argue for slavery. He said that anyone who is or sympathizes with the slaveholders is "the foe of God and man". In the mid-nineteenth century there where also people who said that slavery was not at all bad. On the opposite, they meant that the slaves should be happy for having the opportunity of being slaves. In his poem The Hireling and the Slave, William J Grayson lets us know the differences between those two characters. He describes how the hireling constantly must work to get food, clothes, and a home, how poor and near to be a Pauper he always is. The hireling, according to Mr Grayson, is always living on the edge despite hard work, gets no help from neighbours or charity and the women are even forced to prostitute themselves to survive. His description of the slaves are a bit different, he describes them as ignorant creatures who are lucky to have a master who supports them with food and a home, and all they have to do to get this is "light daily labour". The rest of their time they can sing, laugh, and dance. "The hireling white, without a pitying eye, Or helping hand, at home may starve and die; But that the distant black may softlier fare, Eat, sleep and play, exempt from toil and care," (Grayson 16) The argument that the Negro has an insufficient intelligence and must be protected by a master for his own good is of frequent occurrence. I will once again quote from Mr Grayson's poem. This is his idea of what happens if a slave are emancipated: "The negro freeman - thrifty while a slave, Becomes a helpless drone or crafty knave, Each effort to improve his nature foils; Begs, steals, or sleeps and starves, but never toils," (Grayson 16) George Fitzhugh had the same thoughts. He defended Negro slavery by saying that only a highly moral and intellectual people can be governed by a democracy while the Negro who acts like a child must have a white master who should act as a parent. Those thoughts came from the white supremacy, an idea that says that the white race is superior to the Negro race. Mr Fitzhugh meant that if the Negroes wanted to stay in America they had to content themselves with slavery. The white race should try to civilise and christianise the Negro race, it is their duty. The advocates of slavery meant that the slaves of the South had the best lives since the slavery (or cannibalism) is much crueller in Africa, and as a free man in the North they would grow apathetic. As Mr Fitzhugh writes: "The Southerner is the negro's friend, his only friend" (Fitzhugh 13). He also claims that there would be no slaves if they only were sufficiently intelligent and had moral enough to take care of themselves. The inhabitants of the North did not, as mentioned above, support the Southerner's ideas about slaves and slavery. In 1861 the Civil War broke out, and its main issue was the slavery. Five years later the North won, which finally meant freedom for the slaves. But the racism and the idea of white supremacy have survived in both The South and the North, and are still today not extinct.$$$﻿In the secondary school I hated English lessons. They were always the same; glossary tests, reading a chapter aloud from the book and maybe some grammatics. Not hard work actually, but I didn't like it anyway. Sometimes we had to discuss openly in the classroom, and it was that part I didn't like, almost hated. y teacher in the 7:th till 9:th grade had made himself a very easy way to get off his teaching lightly. Mostly he just let us see some TV-programs in English. Preferably Mr Bean. Maybe we didn't learn to much about grammar and so on, but who cared? We loved the English lessons, of course. It wasn't until secondary school I noticed that my English weren't the best. I felt ashamed and didn't wanted to speak or do anything that showed my lack of knowledge. All tests turned out bad, and I who had very good grades in almost all of the other subjects found out that I strongly disliked English. If you're bad at something and don't like it (actually just because you're bad in it, I suppose) you won't improve, no matter how much your English teacher strains you and herself. She also taught Swedish, where I was one of the best, so she couldn't understand why I was such a disaster in English. Anyway, I survived secondary school, consequently avoiding speaking and reading English unless I really had to. Right after school I went to study biology at the university. Suddenly every course book was written in English, and there were no way you could shirk. It was simple: if you didn't understood the English, you wouldn't understand the course which in turn meant a failed exam. So I had to deal with my dislike for English. My first book "Chemistry" of a thousand pages ought to be finished within ten weeks. At first I had to consult my dictionary for every second word, and it took me a very, very long time. After a while I learned that I didn't needed to understand every single word. A few books later I found out that the English language wasn't that bad after all. Now, when I'm in my third year and have a lot of books behind me the reading isn't any big problem any more. As I mentioned above, I never liked speaking English, I really hated it in school. But the university indirectly helped me out here too. I met a couple of exchange-students. They were even worse in English than I was, but they didn't care! They just carried on talking and if we Swedes didn't understood what they were saying, which happened frequently in the beginning, they just tried with body language. We all had a lot of fun, and at the same time I discovered that they didn't care at all about my bad grammar or if I pronounced something in an incorrect way. They understood what I was saying anyway, and was pleased with it. That, I can tell you, was a relief! The English language now began to interest me. I've already discovered that I needed to improve, but now I actually wanted to learn more and make improvements. The literature on the biology courses helped me a lot with the understanding of texts, but they didn't taught grammar or pronunciation. I decided to take this English course. Listening is something I haven't trained since school and I have always thought that I was bad at that too. But after visiting the first lectures I discovered that I actually - without problems - did understood what the lecturers were talking about. The speaking is still my worst skill. I often feel uncomfortable and insecure. But that's what I'm here for, to change it! I always liked writing - in Swedish of course. It's so easy in Swedish; I have a feeling for which sentence that sounds right and which doesn't, but in English I don't have that little voice in my head. I've always found grammar very boring, and only remembered what I needed a short while to pass the tests. That's one of the things that I now regret. Still I think it's a lot of fun to create an essay.
EE571	0	﻿In the following lines I shall try to evaluate my skills in using the English language, with respect to listening, reading, speaking and writing. I would say my ability to listen to and understand spoken English is generally quite good. At least it seems to me that way; I'm usually able to understand English dialogue on TV and in movies without reading the subtitles, if I want to. On the other hand I suppose that it might be quite another matter in a real conversation, where one is slightly more pressured to understand what someone is saying, without having any subtitles to occasionally glance at when difficulties arise. I like reading in English; fiction originally written in English I usually prefer to read that way, rather than a translation. Usually I am also able to understand what I read fairly well, as the occasional unknown word quite often can be understood in the context of those surrounding it. Generally I keep a dictionary at hand, but I use it mostly for words that seem very important and cannot be otherwise understood. Having studied mathematics and computer science at university for two and a half years, I have also been exposed to quite a lot of English non fiction texts, as most of the course literature has been in English. This usually didn't present very much of a problem either, the language of those books being generally quite simple and the difficulties one might have lying mostly in understanding the various technical terms occurring rather frequently. When it comes to speaking English, I suppose I have had more difficulties there than with listening and reading, at least when it comes to pronunciation. During some of my earlier years of school, I wasn't able to pronounce very well at all, words assuming strange and unpleasant shapes when entering my mouth. I suppose it was mostly due to nervousness about speaking in front of others; fear of not being able to pronounce words correctly obviously not helping very much. This problem did eventually decrease, and during my last years of school, I suppose, my pronunciation wasn't very much worse than anyone else's. My English teacher, however, claimed that I spoke with a clearly Scottish accent. I really don't know what to think of this; I do find slightly hard to believe as I haven't, as far as I know, been exposed to very much English spoken with a Scottish accent, and I suppose it might have been nothing more than a peculiar idea of my English teachers. Nowadays, since I think I've improved my pronunciation and ridded myself from most of my alleged Scottish accent, I do feel I'm able to speak quite fluently in English, even if I might still stumble on certain words and sounds, especially if I'm nervous or pressured. In school, especially during the last years, I used to like writing essays in English, always trying to use what I thought of as typically British expressions. However, my teacher occasionally complained that my sentences grew too long, my expressions too elaborate and my style of writing too academic and detached. Writing too long sentences has always been one of my weaknesses, no matter what language I write them in, but nowadays I find it easier control this violent urge of mine, and therefore one might perhaps say my writing has improved, in English and otherwise. I still enjoy writing in English, anyway, and don't find it too hard, even if I probably still have a slight inclination towards elaboration and long sentences. Writing this text though, it strikes me that it was actually quite a long time ago that I last wrote anything of some length in English, and perhaps I'm a bit more uncertain about spelling than I used to be, having to look words up in a dictionary every now and then. On the whole I'd say my English is fairly good today, but as I have received most of my practise in using the English language not as much from long time spent in an English speaking environment as from time spent within a classroom, and from reading books and watching television, I can mostly assess my skills in relation to those rather safe and undemanding situations. In a different environment my weaknesses would, no doubt, make themselves more evident, even to me.$$$﻿ SMOKING OR NON-SMOKING? Imagine a night out, you have had a few drinks, done a bit of dancing and are now in bed ready to go to sleep feeling quite satisfied with the evening. When you wake up next morning with (probably) a hangover and a smell in your hair, your clothes and bed, witch can be defined as tobacco smell., you do not feel as glamorous as you did last night. The hangover is (of course) your own fault, but the smell if you are a non-smoker? Is it really reasonable that other people has the power to endanger your health? Should you not be the one to decide about your own future? The right thing to do would be to ban smoking at night clubs and pubs all over the country. This might not be an easy task, so my aim would be the nations in Uppsala, since I know that it is possible. The main reason to why there should be no- smoking at the nations, is the danger that comes along with smoking. To begin with; smoking can give you several diseases, the most severe one being cancer. Secondly there is always the danger of fire. Most of the nations are situated in old buildings where the risk of fire are great. Just by flicking your cigarettebump not put out onto a couch or the floor, etc. could start a fire, and with alcohol, often consumed on a night out, comes poor judgment so this happens very often. Surely the nations are provided with fire- extinguishers but that is not enough protection, since the nations usually are overcrowded on a Friday night. Of course this is something the nations should take under consideration anyway and not just with the smoking issue. Furthermore what happened to the free will? It is said that each and every person has their own free will to make a decision, but this is not the case here. Diseases through smoking does not just affect smokers, but also non- smokers, who through inhaling the smoke from others can just as easily and sometimes easier get cancer or asthma This fact makes my statement even clearer thinking of the people working for instance behind the bar, waitresses, waiters and DJ's even. Although they might be smokers themselves they should be able to decide how much they want to smoke and the fact is that someone has to work in order to keep the place running. Let us not forget another important group of people- the people who is allergic to smoke and those with severe asthma. These people cannot go to these, places in order to stay healthy and alive and this is all because of the smoke which is not fair. Why should smokers make other people, although not on purpose, stay away? Oddly enough people continue to smoke even though they know that they are endangering themselves and others. Fortunately there is a solution to everything and of course to this problem as well. To begin with, why not just prohibit smoking at the nations? It has been tested in several cities and it has worked out beautifully. Norrlands nation in Uppsala has actually banned smoking in some parts of the building so that is a step in the right direction. Disregarding this as a solution at least have one room where people can smoke and no one else had to suffer. Although this solution might not be perfect at least it is better then the current situation. A few days ago my friends and I went to Stockholms nation to have lunch and left after an hour with the stench of tobacco in our hair and clothes even though neither one of us smoked during that time. The smell was probably there from the night before or even earlier. However, we still want to go back in spite of the smell, because the food is nice The question is, would someone allergic to smoke or with asthma be able to have lunch there if only just for an hour? In short banning smoking at the nations can only have a positive outcome regarding the health situation for non- smokers, which includes staff, visitors and of course for the smokers as well. I myself tend to smoke a cigarette or two sometimes on a night out and would be more than happy to smoke it outside.
EE139	1	﻿ On the verge of a crisis. Is it high time to raise the teachers' salaries? This is a statement that has been discussed in many parts of the country. It is a topic that is frequently debated on the news and in various TV and radio programs. The most frequent arguments for the raising of the salaries are: to improve the teaching profession's standing in society, to motivate the teachers and to increase the percentage of male teachers. On the other hand, there are counterarguments such as the long holidays, the short workdays and the spending of money on other areas of school than on teachers have been heard. By raising the teachers' salaries the profession would first of all improve its current standing. To know about your future economical situation is of great importance for young people who have not yet decided their future careers. This knowledge would attract more students to the teacher training and also to actually finish their degree. Many students do not graduate at present, due to lack of belief in their future as a teacher. If we manage to solve the present problem with too few actual teachers in school, this would help us to keep up the standard of Swedish education. The low wages of Swedish teachers make many of them leave their jobs to be replaced by young substitutes. Many of these do not have a degree and are often not competent enough to teach certain subjects. In the long run this has the effect on the pupils that they are not being taught enough to be able to cope with society, further education and future careers. To motivate the teachers to stay, they must know that they will get credit for all the hard work. Knowing this, they will give us enthusiastic teachers that in turn will generate with the pupils' improved skills and grades. Female staff dominates the Swedish school at present. The profession seems to have taken a different turn, being more of a caring kind. Children need caring, but they also need discipline and most of all they need role models for their future life. This is because of their tendency to not do what they are told by adults, but instead imitating them in their behaviour. If the teachers' wages are raised, it will attract more men to school. This is essential since all children need role models, both boys and girls. When it comes to the counterarguments, there is the myth of too long holidays. Usually people in Sweden have five weeks of vacation per year, while teachers have not only summer holidays of ten weeks but also Christmas, Easter, autumn- and spring-break. Considering the length of their vacations, the teachers should be satisfied with the fairly low wages. A second argument is that teachers in most cases spend a fairly low number of hours at work. Besides, one could argue that the teachers' profession cannot be that strenuous, considering that they work with children. Compared to other regular workers in society the teachers' wages are not extremely low. All the money that would be spent on the teachers could be of better use, for example to buy new and more current books and to improve the environment in the school. The Swedish school system has been very well functioning for a long time. To be able to maintain this reputation, something must be done and according to my opinion the first step should be to raise the teachers' salaries: at present they are a joke. The people who argument against this do not realize that we are on the verge of an educational crisis. This is what has happened in the segregated parts of America, children (mostly in the state/public schools) not learning enough to be able to cope with their lives when they get older. The result of this has been not only that many American inhabitants seem to lack general basic knowledge but also in an increased rate of crime and drug-abuse. Hopefully the Swedish educational system will not go as far as the American has, but in order to prevent this to happen, something has to be done now.$$$﻿ Do you live your own life? Ever since the arrival of television there have been discussions whether it has good or bad influence on people. I believe that TV in itself is a fantastic way of reaching people world wide, providing them with entertainment but also with current information regarding political as well as cultural news. Yet there has over the last few years occurred a large concentration on TV programmes with vague content regarding connection to reality, such as talk shows and endless series. This concentration is in my opinion the most serious threat to the positive use of television. In order to lead a good life, internal as well as external, you need to make some effort by yourself, it is not enough to sit in front if the TV and receive your life through images. The talk shows and series mentioned above are what I would like to refer to as bad TV. Much of this derives from American television and has lately had a immense influence on Swedish broadcasting. Besides the fact that it is a source of useful information TV has become some sort of 'friend' that you can spend an entire day together with. For some people it goes as far as to almost become a substitute for their own reality. Still I believe that TV is an enormous opportunity for people to get information about the world that surrounds them. In Sweden we know that watching channel 1 and 2 probably gives us a wider range of serious information regarding news items, cultural events and entertainment while channel 3, 4 and 5 have more of a superficial character. These channels are rather new and ever since they started broadcasting they have had a large influence of American TV and as far as I am concerned they are the prototype of bad TV. Examples of this so-called bad TV are talk shows, romantic series filled with intrigues and films that show a lot of violence. The violence in these films tends to give people a very unrealistic image of the damages physical abuse and the usage of weapons can cause. Children and young people might get a somewhat distorted image of these consequences and this in turn gives them a false feeling of being immortal. The broadcast of talk shows and romantic series also provides people, both younger and older, with an imaginary picture of what your love life and also sexual relations should be like. If you have this image of reality I believe that it is difficult for many people to be content with what they have. They get problems with settling down and they always have a wish to rush off towards something new and different as soon as life gets a bit too regular. Their external, made-up world presides over their inner world and they do not take the chance to explore what they have got within. This inner world I believe needs nourishing and you will not be able to get this nourishment through bad TV. Naturally all TV, good or bad, does encourage passive behaviour but my opinion is that in order to nourish your inner self you must use your own mind. This you can do by reading a book, go to the cinema or, why not, sit down in the sofa to watch a good film that is on TV. What can be more relaxed than to enjoy a film at home or together with friends? What I mean is that it is up to you to nourish your own head, you have the possibility to choose what to watch, then it is your choice if it will be Ricki Lake or Dokument. If you wish to live your own life you must make these choices but obviously this is also a question of what you are offered. In Sweden we still have a choice to watch programmes of higher quality or, as Postman expresses himself, junk-entertainment. In order to not live someone else's life, you must start to nourish your inner world and it is only up to you how it should be done.
EE137	1	﻿ It is all about finding a good balance I'm not one of those freaks, neither one of those who think that it is totally unnecessary to have one. I guess I'm quite normal since I've got one and I spend everything from 0-3 hours a day in front of it. I think I could live without it but I wouldn't like to try! What I'm talking about is something that in a way has changed our lifestyle. It's an advanced technical invention that lots of us take for granted even though we haven't had it in our homes for more than about 40 years. What I am talking about is of course the TV, subject for eternal debates as it seems. Where is television culture taking us and is it good or bad? are questions that divide people in all countries where television is an influential power in society. I am probably somewhere between the two extremities in my point of view. I don't think that it has to be all or nothing because there is not just one good and one bad side. There is something in the middle that shows that there are both good and bad things about TV. That is what I will try to point out in this essay. I think it is all about finding a good balance. My grandparents never have supper between 5 and 6 PM. They either have it before or after and you may wonder why. The answer is simple: my grandpa is a big fan of Sunset Beach and this is the time when it is broadcast. Is this idiotic or is it normal? Well, considering that my grandfather is almost 80 years old and doesn't have so many daily habits anymore, I gladly let him keep this one even though it is a quite stupid one and far from all those he have had earlier in his life. Even children have their special, important time in front of the TV. Even though many of them haven't learnt to tell the time yet, they know that Bolibompa starts at 6.15 PM. These are two very good examples of the enormous role that television plays in society today and how important it is for people in all ages. Television has got something that attracts a big number of people and there are actually lots of good things about many of the programs and shows that we watch. Television, for example, is and was from the beginning one of the most important way to spread news and information that concern us all. It goes quickly and it gives us a better picture of what has happened than any other media. It also gives us access to events where we cannot all be present. I'm thinking especially of sport events. What would the opening of the Olympic Games be if we couldn't see the fire being lit? And imagine when people saw Armstrong taking his first step on the moon... Don't we feel more participating when we watch something than when we can only listen to it? I think so. But lots of programs are good even though we are not participating in the same way. Many shows has the purpose of educating both children and adults, and they do it really good. There are lots of people who are not very fund of reading but who can get knowledge from watching TV and who get access to world literature thanks to the filmversion of many novels. I am not, of course, saying that it is the same thing to read a novel as it is to see the film, but at least it is better than nothing. Also, all programs want to give the newest and most interesting information and this actually gives that type of programs high quality. I think you can actually learn a lot from watching debate, culture, and nature programs. The bad things about television is that it in many cases makes us passive since we seldom have to think by ourselves when we watch a show. TV demands much less of its watchers than a book does of its readers. It is also easier, I think, to remain in reality when you read a book than when you watch a film or a TV show. I guess all young girls have sometimes dreamt of being one of the rich, pretty girls in the luxurious Beverly Hills. This, together with violence, is the biggest problems with TV today. We have to be aware of the fact that especially young people are very easily affected by television so maybe we have to be more careful with showing too much soaps where life is easy and perfect if you have only got some money. Some shows definitely need to come closer to reality. But if TV is going to stop being just good or just bad I think we have to learn to watch it the right way. We have to watch what is worth watching and to make TV part of our lives, not the only existing thing. As I mentioned earlier, this is a subject that has so many angles and that can be discussed over and over again since there are constantly new debates where you have to take stand and new shows to discuss. I've probably missed lots of good shows while writing this essay. Fortunately, I have got a video!$$$﻿ Old fashioned or the hottest trend? What was in the past something so natural for young people as wearing jeans is nowadays, wearing school uniforms is today often looked upon as something boring, old fashioned and something that deprives a child much of his or her identity. I disagree and think that school uniforms could serve as an effective weapon against problems related to increasingly differences in children's culture, background and social status. I think that there are so many good arguments for making school uniforms compulsory and I'm surprised that so few schools in Sweden today consider wearing school uniforms as an important step towards less bullying and more equality. I can't count the mornings during my years in school that I was standing in front of my wardrobe searching for something nice to wear. And none of these days were any special, except for when photographs were taken. All the other days were just ordinary school days. And who doesn't remember worrying about not wearing the same type of clothes as everybody else, about being too different from all the others. This is, I think, something that lots of children carry with them from their first year in school till they graduate. And that is something we have to change. ore and more Swedish schools today experience increasingly bullying often when cultural diversity grows. There is obviously a need among children of being a group, not just mentally but even more important, in appearance. And what would suit better, in a world where fashion is as important as it is in society today and when the fashion trade direct more and more advertisement towards younger and younger people, than start wearing uniforms in school. I think this would make fashion more of a personal interest, something you as an individual could choose if you want to support or not and that would change the situation in school. Because someone wearing old clothes, bought five years ago and that two or three older brothers or sisters have already worn for a couple of years, is often an easy victim for bullies. And a child being bullied for a thing like this is something that we should really make an effort to stop. And why not doing it in such a simple way as to introduce school uniforms. We live in a multi- cultural society where conflicts not seldom arise because of differences in manners and customs and but it's still our will to create an harmonious unity for children in schools and during their social activities. We want all to have the possibility of keeping their own traditions and culture but there is also a fight for equality, for all being the same and for all having the same possibilities. School uniforms would much correspond to these aims and would make it easier, especially for the most vulnerable in society. Unfortunately, there are still huge differences in economic status among Swedish families and this is of course followed by big differences for children in the same class. A single child with well- paid parents has no problems in always following the hottest trend and always having the right newest clothes and things. The situation for another child in the same class with three brothers and sisters and with parents earning just under the average income is of course totally different. This, the economic aspect, is another important one of introducing school uniforms. Not only would children be in need of fewer sets of clothes since there would be no difference in appearance (with ordinary clothes, both children and parents feel that the child can't wear the same clothes all the time), but it would also make it easier for a child to wear old clothes that doesn't fit an older brother or sister anymore since the style hasn't changed. People against school uniforms say that the uniforms make children lose their identity and that introducing school uniforms would be a bad way of trying to control things. But young children's identities are reflected much more in their behaviour and in what they say. Contrary to make less identity, I think that children would feel it assuring, knowing that they've all got the same clothes not depending on if they are rich or poor, black or white or if they come from two totally different countries and cultures.
EE136	0	﻿ Having two mums or two dads must be better than growing up in an orphanage or maybe not growing up at all! On TV debates you often hear people who think that homosexuals aren't suited to adopt children say things like: 'A child deserves to grow up with both a mother and a father'. And of course that's something we all agree with, but that just isn't possible even if it is what we all want for our children. So to those with that argument I'd like to ask a question which I think is an important question to think about: Is it better to have spent your entire childhood in an orphanage rather than to come to a family with two mothers or fathers? To me the answer to this question is easy, no it isn't and here's why: When you think about all the children around the world living in orphanages that can't even provide the most essential medications for their children when they get sick, you feel uncomfortable, because some of them even die before they reach their teens. All over the world there's orphanages with few means to take care of children in the way we all think that they deserve to be taken care of. But still, a homosexual couple in Sweden can't give one of them a better life and a family. There are so many children that won't have a family at all because of that. The number of children without parents around the world is enormous, adoptions might not make the problem go away, but if we allowed homosexual couples to adopt like other couples these numbers would at least decline. Even if it meant that only a small number of children got better conditions to live in, that should be reason enough to make us consider giving homosexuals the chance to be adoptive parents. Those against homosexual couples adopting says that children should have the right to grow up with both a mum and a dad. However the problem with that opinion is that children already live in Sweden without both a mum and a dad. Just look at the divorce rates, the number of single mums in this country is increasing every year. So I think that a child in a family with homosexual parents can have the same chances in life as a child who lives with just their mum or dad. People living in what's called 'nuclear families' are becoming unusual. That is a fact, so why does it have to be such a big deal that adopted children doesn't have that kind of families either? The importance of having both male and female role models while growing up is as often discussed as having both a mum and a dad, and the issues are of course linked together. I can see why a boy who's only male role models come from action series on TV might be a big problem. Therefore when it comes to a child to homosexual parents and the lack of role models I simply can't see that as a bigger issue than if it has to do with a boy living alone with just his heterosexual mother. Actually I suspect that a homosexual couple planning to adopt a child would be better prepared for this problem than a newly divorced mother to an eleven year old son. If you know that your child will have two parents with the same sex you're likely to look to other family members for support. You might for example have a great grandfather or brother who will be a perfect role model. You can have endless discussions about issues like this one. The problem is that while I am arguing with someone who might be against the whole idea of homosexuals taking care of children just because of his or hers own prejudice, children die because they don't have anyone to take care of them. Can it possibly be that hard to find a way to give children from orphanages good homes with loving parents, whether there are a mum and a dad, or two mums or two dads in the picture? Obviously it's a problem, but my point is that it shouldn't have to be this hard to take care of children who just want to have a family, any family.$$$﻿ English, My English! In third grade, I had my first contact with an English school book. I remember looking at a few words in the first chapter and quietly reading them to myself: "Car, cat, Steve, ball, Susan". I was thrilled - this was English? This was going to be a piece of cake... A couple of terms later I had become somewhat wiser - I had realized that every time I was even close to thinking that I was in control of the language, the teacher would reveal yet another spelling rule, a linguistic term, or even a new word that would bring me back to square one again. Today, I have moved a number of squares ahead, though. On TV I can hear English every day, I've read a number of English books and I've written some essays. I've been abroad - and there been forced to speak English in order to make myself understood. I'm getting more confident all the time. Still I know I have a lot to learn - for instance when it comes to speaking. Naturally, the only way to really learn how to speak a language - any language - fluently, is to actually speak it as often as you can. Of course, you'll have to learn a few grammatical rules first, but practice is still of great importance. I am a living proof of that: The last time I studied English was in Upper Secondary School, in 1990. Since then, I have spoken English only sporadically, a fact that I very much notice today. For instance in "Samholla/Tal"-class, I feel "rusty" and I'm having problems remembering some words I know I have known before. But I hope and think it will all come back to me after a few months of practicing, and I am convinced that my vocabulary gradually will improve. In my opinion, listening to English is the "easiest" part of learning English. As I briefly mentioned in the introduction, television plays a main role in many people's everyday lives, as it does in mine. And as a major part of all TV-shows, and all popular culture for that matter, is American or British, listening to English has become an almost natural part of my life. The more I hear English, the more I get accustomed to it. One drawback to "learning" English from television, is that that kind of language often consists of slang; you have to pay attention to be able to tell correct English from incorrect. However, it's clear that my knowledge of English is greater now than it would have been without the help of television, cinema, music, computers, etc. And to some extent I also have technology to thank for part of my English reading skill. I enjoy reading. The first novel I read in English was Agatha Christie's "Endless Night". Though I'm sure I didn't appreciate every single nuance of it, I enjoyed reading it. At first I felt a bit uncomfortable, having to look up unfamiliar words in a dictionary every now and then. But after a while I didn't bother, since I noticed that I didn't have to understand every single word to grasp the story. Since "Endless Night" I've read quite a few books in English, and since there are several great pieces of literature that never even get translated into Swedish, I'm glad I struggled my way through Agatha Christie's, at first seemingly endless, mystery. Yes, and of course, thanks to technology in general, and the Internet in particular, reading in English on a daily basis, has become as common as hearing English on TV every day. And practice is, as I earlier stressed, of greatest importance. That, of course, applies to writing aswell, otherwise I guess this assignment would be unnecessary. Which takes us to the last part, namely writing. I've been working as a journalist for a few years, doing quite a bit of writing - in Swedish, that is. I don't know if my vocational experience is going to be of any use now, as I study English. I know I can write, but I don't know if I can do it in English. Will I mix the two languages up "in the heat of the moment"? That remains to be seen. Still, as I sit in the comfort of my own home, writing, I can for instance look up words in the dictionary, or I can make changes in my text after a few hours. And that's a luxury I can't afford when speaking English. So, in a way, writing is easier. I've always regarded myself as being fairly good at the English language, at least when it comes to listening, reading and maybe even writing. But the spoken part of the language requires a lot more practice than I've had so far. I hope that after this term I will have broadened my linguistic skills to including all four above mentioned parts. And not just simply because I want to pass the course, but because I'd love to one day really master the language.
EE135	1	﻿ Julius Caesar Close reading, Act III.ii After Caesars' murder Antony comes to the scene of the crime and faces the conspirators. Antony manages to convince them that he trust their motives for killing Caesar. Antony has been given permission to speak to the crowd on the premise that he is not to blame the conspirators, but only speak well of Caesar. After the conspirators disperse Antonys' vows to revenge Caesars' death. Brutus speaks to the crowd just after Caeser murder and the mob understands that Caeser died because he was ambitious. Antony comes out to speak to the mob they are hostile but on Brutus's request they allow him to speak. At this point we know only of Antony's love of music, and loyalty towards Caesar. Shakespeare takes this opportunity to demonstrate that Brutus has severely underestimated Antony. In the beginning of Antonys' speech he says: Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me; But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honourable man. (III.ii 85-88) The irony can be heard in this first passage. We know that Antony does not mean what he says and you begin to see his cleverness. We begin to hear which path he will take. Not a direct one but one of simple deduction. He is not going to straight out tell them that Brutus was wrong but will explain why Caesar was not ambitious. Antony takes all of Brutus claims of why he killed Caesar and systematically eliminates them. Antony says in Act III, scene ii line101 "I come not to disprove what Brutus spoke", but that is just what he comes to do to refute Brutus, this reveals the other side of Antony. How with his passion and gift for words he will crush Brutus who although noble has done the worst thing of all in Antonys' eyes, the betrayal of a friend, expressing this in the following lines: For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, Quite vanquished him: then burst his mighty heart; (III.ii 185-188) These words are Antonys' they come from him not Caesar. Thus leading me to believe that Antony must have known how Caesar would have felt being betrayed by a friend. At this point in the passage Antony has managed to persuade the mob that Caeser was not ambitious. We know this when the crowds yell out "O traitors! This is not just a man that has lost a friend this is also a man with ulterior motives. Antony reveals not only his talent for persuasion but also his talent to lead. He is a skillful leader, he does not directly tell them how to react, but instead he insinuates by expressing what he would do in their situation: Good friend, sweet friend, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. (III.ii, 211-212) In order to be a skillful leader you have to be a skillful orator and in this speech Antony with his rhetorical skills demonstrates his ability to get the mobs empathy. He appeals to their emotional side, he knows that the mob is stupid so he thinks for them as well. At the same time putting thoughts into their minds such as in Act III scene ii line 225; "I tell you that which you yourselves do know". But just before this line he tells them: For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men's blood; I only speak right on. (III.ii, 222-224) It is precisely all these qualities that Antony does possess that allow him to take control of the crowd in a way that Brutus never could. Antony not only convinces the crowd of Caesars' innocence, moreover has a plan of action after the initial conquest of the mob. Furthermore I do not think he would have been able to get Brutus to allow him to speak if he did not have all these qualities. It is the final show of his role as a leader that demonstrates why he was able to take power from Brutus. Antony realizes he has gained control but he doesn't stop there he has a plan. Unlike Brutus he takes this opportunity that has presented itself and uses it to his advantage. Once he has taken control of the mob he says: Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not! I must tell you then: You have forgot the will I told you of. (III.ii, 236-239) This maneuver is skillful on Antonys' part in that he tells them what to do since they do not know what to do. Then he uses his wit to ask the Crowd what it was that Caesar did to deserve their love. He compliments the mob with flattery by pretending that they have always been loyal to Caesar. Allowing the mob to forget their rashness in their loyalty towards Brutus. Then not to reveal his own selfish motives for wanting mutiny he reminds them of the will. Making his altruism all the more believable. When the mob has gone to burn the conspirators' houses Antony finally speaks openly: Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot, Take thou what course thou wilt. (III.ii, 261-262) His motives are revealed explicitly, and we know that here is a man that not only has the power of conviction but the means to pull it off. Antonys' speech is essential to the play in that it reveals Brutus' lack of leadership as well as the reality of Caesars' death. Antony points out what Brutus seems to forget. That by killing Caesar he would not only save Rome but he would be a traitor. Another thing that Brutus forgot is the way in which he and the conspirators killed Caesar. Brutus allows Antony to speak; thus allowing Antony to use Caesars' blood trenched body to reveal the harsh and cruel way in which they murdered him. Shakespeare shows us Antony and at the same time reveals the over-idealistic world Brutus lived in.$$$﻿ Europe's growing trend 70 police storm techno club - 700 pills seized.1 Ecstasy culture approaches its 10th summer.2 "Mad for it," headlines small and large over Europe's major cities all writing about ecstasy, Europe's latest drug problem. The fact is that the UN has marked this drug as a Global Trend, it's not just in Europe it's worldwide. Where did it come from and how did it get here? It started in Californian as a treatment for Psychoanalysis, it allowed the patient to open up and share their intermost feelings and talk about their childhood easier. It then reached into underground sub-culture and soon after became illegal. The sub-culture popularly referred to as Rave, can be compared to sub-cultures of the sixties and seventies, such as flower children and hippies. Rave is basically a dance party with loud techno and house type music. Odd lighting effects people dancing everywhere, and the use of synthetic drugs, mainly ecstasy are often present. Ecstasy started being used by ravers almost from the start of the rave, which began in the early eighties. It spread from the Chicago nightlife and New York black-gay scene to Europe under a very short period. There are many reasons why ecstasy has attracted such a large audience with its, social acceptance, accessibility and inexpensive production cost it has become the second most used drug in the European Union. Over 30 million users worldwide (4% of the world population), according to the UNWDP (e.g. United Nations General Assembly on the World Drug Problem). Lets look at a few of the causes for the increase of ecstasy. One cause is the social acceptance of the drug. Its side effects are not entirely known. People have regarded ecstasy as a relatively safe drug, but this is not the entire truth. There have been a number of deaths many occurring at clubs or raves where dehydration and over heating have been a major factor. The reason for this is that when on ecstasy one is given an euphoric feeling, which inhibits the body's signals, which in a normal situation would warn the person that they are thirsty and tired. In the case of the raver who is on ecstasy he/she keeps on dancing disregarding any warning signs. Drug abuse is often used by youths trying to cope with the problems of unemployment, neglect, violence and sexual abuse. This is not the case with ecstasy; it became popular by youths that were socially integrated, youths, whose parents would appear to be more tolerant towards the use of drugs. For many, ecstasy is perfect, it lasts a few hours, it cannot be traced once worn off and the price is right. Ecstasy and other synthetic drugs can be easily synthesized in makeshift labs, called kitchens and sold at relatively cheap prices. The easy production of the drug has allowed the drug pushers a cheaper drug to distribute with relatively little risk of being caught. Production procedures are spread via Internet along with information on how to obtain the raw materials and equipment for synthesis of ecstasy. One way to stop the outflow of synthetic drugs is to try and ban the sale of the chemicals, which are needed to produce them. However, with the lucrative business the pushers use other chemicals and fillers are used, that in the end make for a drug that can be more dangerous because it may have ingredients that are poisonous to the system. Resulting in "impure" dosages that can cause allergic reactions, psychosis, or death. Since the laboratories used to make Ecstasy can be anything from makeshift kitchens to sophisticated labs, production is increasing, allowing for easy accessibility. Accessibility has been one of the reasons for drugs spreading quickly, this holds true for ecstasy as well. The chemicals used in ecstasy are inexpensive and globally accessible. Synthetic drugs, such as ecstasy can be synthesized close to the customers therefore staying out of custom or border control. Moreover, today's surveillance technology does not allow sensitive detection of these drugs. For instance, dogs cannot trace artificially synthesized drugs such as ecstasy. Because of its potency, a small quantity is all that is needed to supply over a thousand trips, making it more difficult to trace by customs. The more accessible a drug is the more likely of it spreading to a larger fraction of the population. As long as the accessibility, acceptability, and low purchase price of ecstasy stays strong, there will only be a rise in the demand, thus increasing deaths and unknown side effects for our youth. This weekend drug will continue spreading on the dance floors unless something is done to make people aware of the dangers. Ignorance about the side effects of this drug should not make it more acceptable; nevertheless this is the case. Ignorance has become bliss. You get what you pay for and that is exactly the case, an unknown drug, cheaply produced with synthetic chemicals bought at a cheap price for the soul purpose of making profit. 1 Hamburger Abendblatt (Germany) 2 The Guardian (UK), Collin
EE327	1	﻿ What should children not be allowed to watch on television? In the article "Television: Locking out violence" in Time Magazine of July 24, 1995, an interesting issue is raised: What would we not like our children to watch on television? What is "objectionable content"? Brutal violence might easily qualify for this label. But could not there be other things too, which maybe are not so obvious? Where should we draw the line? First of all, we must determine whether children should be allowed or not to watch everything on television. Sooner or later, children will anyway face violence, for example, in films and on television, so what is the point of hiding it from them? However, children are easily affected and often incapable of understanding fiction. In order to protect them from traumatic and frightening experiences, some kind of censorship is desirable. Total censoring of violence could be a problem too, because if every little bit of violence was to be removed there might be a gap between the children's world view and the adult one, or even between the children's worldview and reality... As the child grows up, the difference could be a shock. In this respect, it is better to accustom children to a certain amount of violence on television. It sounds absurd, but as violence does exist in society, it would be unreasonable to keep children from watching any trace of it. Thus, a line has to be drawn separating what is objectionable from what is not. This is hard enough when only physical violence is involved: should children be kept only from watching brutal, directly described violence, or also violence that is only suggested? Children have great imagination and hints and traces of violence might cause them considerable damage too. This leads us to asking what is really important: the degree of violence or the signification of it? Should a detective series and a documentary about war be treated equally? Is it not possible that the documentary is the "worst" because it is real? You cannot (truthfully, at least) tell your child that the war is only fiction, that it never happened, or that it never will happen again! Again the relation to reality is significant. If we look at the degree of violence there is also a question to answer: what kind of violence is too brutal for children to be seen? Opinions differ somewhat on this point. Some parents are anxious to keep their children from watching anything that could be the least cruel or horrid in children's eyes, while others seem much less troubled on this point. Now I would like to discuss the second aspect of the initial question, namely what else than violence might be regarded as "objectionable content" on television? Sex, many people would say. Pornography is obviously not suited for children, but sex scenes in "usual" films and programmes are not really a problem, I would say. But what about television as a model of behaviour and morality in general for children? Take a look at all the so-called "soaps" which are heaped upon us today. Here there is no violence, but something else that I find a bit objectionable: the characters. In many cases, they exceed all bounds with treachery, falsehood, greed, selfishness, and superficiality. It can be good entertainment, but is that the way children sees it? Do they understand that this is not how they should behave? I do not think that all children realise that what they watch on television is not always the real world. However, I doubt the effect of this kind of censorship. Would children be pure and unspoilt, or incapable of understanding these things when they meet with them in real life? You cannot really tell. Besides, if we go as far as to censor television programmes on moral and ethical grounds, the step to ideological censorship is not a very big one. What is objectionable content depends on who you are: in the article referred to above, we are told that a right- to-life group has already asked CBS for the possibility to censor programmes dealing with abortion. If this were allowed, what subjects would be censored next? This use risk being anti-democratic. What you should allow you child to watch on television is thus a complicated question to which there is no universal answer - ultimately it is you who must decide what is best for your children.$$$﻿ "No one knows the cruelty": Women and children of the Industrial Revolution The Industrial Revolution brought many changes to British society. The ways of living of the lowest classes were slowly altered. In this essay, I will particularly explore the impact of industrialism on the lives of working-class women and children, and how their living and working conditions began to change during the mature industrial period of the late 19th century. Industrial production, which had begun to gain ground in the 18th century, superseded the working classes' traditional way of earning their living: through work in the home. These people now moved to the industrial cities for employment in factories. The vast urbanisation starting in the early 19th century led to housing problems (overcrowded dwellings without heating, ventilation and sanitation) and a fast-growing slum of poor factory workers. The working conditions in the factories were awful: ten, twelve, maybe thirteen hours of labour under extremely risky circumstances. Many workers were crippled or died young because of accidents or diseases due to the unhealthy conditions in the factories. Young children too were employed full-time, and their working conditions were at least as bad as those of adult workers. The traditional role of the working-class woman was confined to the home: raising children and take care of the household, while her husband worked. The money he earned he gave to her, who was given control over the household budget. This meant that the working-class wife had substantial power within the family. Many did not manage as well as they could have, though: there were reports of the incapability of many housewives to use the money wisely (Vicinus, 7). As the 19th century progressed, material standards improved somewhat. But all working-class women were not equally affected by these small changes, as we shall see. For some, the conditions in general deteriorated. The working-class population of this era could be divided into three categories: the relatively well-off artisans, who had middle-class aspirations; the average factory labour force (including textile and other industry workers, and miners); and the traditional poor, who constituted 1/4 of the urban working class. The lives of the women of the two latter groups were fairly alike during the beginning and the middle of the 19th century, but towards the end of it things began to happen. New attitudes arose among the average working-class women due to a number of things. Real wages increased rapidly from mid-century, and the slight improvement in living standards resulting from this was one thing; education was another - more and more women were becoming literate. The birth rate began to decline for the first time in working-class families. The lesser number of children, along with the Education Act of 1870 that stipulated that all children under the age of ten should go to school, resulted in more free time for the mothers. It was a time of break with tradition that caused considerable distress among these women: they had left the traditional resignation that the very poorest still felt, a resignation which both perpetuated the poverty and made it easier to endure (Vicinus, 9). What the women in working-class families above the subsistence level felt was expectations and hopes that were far from being satisfied, and because of this, a great despair and unhappiness. In about the same time, these women lost their important economic role in the family. The men began to take control over the family budget, but still expected their wives to manage as before, although they had less money to spend. Inflation in the early 1900s aggravated this problem. While the lot of many working-class wives remained the same or worsened towards the turn of the century, that of young, unmarried women changed for the better. Female employment rapidly increased from the 1890s onwards, and it was unmarried girls over the age of fifteen that made the difference. Their working in factories between school and marriage became quite normal; married women, however, were not supposed to work outside home. The young women enjoyed a relative economic affluence and freedom, which made it even harder for them to adjust to the life of a married woman - for they did marry, and at about the same age as their mothers and grandmothers. All traditional patterns were not dissolving. Child labour was widely extended in 19th-century Britain. Before industrialism, children had mainly worked as agricultural workers or domestic servants, or they had worked at home. Now, they too were included in the workforce of industrial production. Their low wages, obedience and small size made them very attractive to employers in, for example, the mining, the textile, and the steel- and iron industries. There are no figures to tell us how many children were exploited in factories and elsewhere, except that only the Lancashire mills employed some 30,000 children a year (Mitchell, 2) Legislation in the early 19th century had little impact on the lives of the industrial workers. From the middle of the century, however, a public opinion against child labour was growing, which enabled legislation concerning the children's working conditions. In 1874, it was illegal to employ children under the age of ten full time. The Education Act of 1870, which I have already mentioned, was extremely important because it started the process which was to become the most important thing for the improvement of the conditions of the working class: its education and political awareness. As for working hours, legislation regulating the number of working hours for women was adopted between 1844 and 1850, for instance the Ten Hours Act (1847) which established ten hours of labour per day, and short Saturdays, in the textile industry. These regulations came to apply to the men too, and later other trades as well. In 1875 the working week was set to 54-56 1/2 hours, and 25 years later, the 8 hours workday was achieved by many British workers. The women's breaking up from traditional resignation was clearly a prerequisite for the improvement of their situation and therefore a good thing. However, it took a long time and a lot of suffering before anything was achieved, especially for the poorest. It almost seems that they did not realise themselves with what cruelty they were treated by society. The indirect reason for the non-improved or worsened social conditions for working-class wives was the Victorian view of women which was eventually gaining ground among the lower classes, and which would not change until the first decades of the 20th century. Legislation did play a part in the lives of the working classes, not least in regulating child labour, but their general situation, and the women's especially, depended much more on the prevailing values and ideas of society as a whole.
EE232	1	﻿ The temptations of the Basque: A Revised Summary. In "The Temptations of the Basque" (Deia sept. 6, 1999), manuel de Unciti argues that the nationalist sector in Euskadi does not help Basque people reach a complete pacification there. He explains that the nationalist political parties would really like to set up a conciliatory dialogue between them and the central government in Madrid, but the truth is that they want to be in control of that dialogue and also impose the basic conditions for it. Moreover, the central government is doing its best to be in contact with both parts but it is the nationalist that refuse to the approach from Madrid. Unciti states that the independence of the Basque Country from Spain is now something unreachable, a "utopia". For him, it suggests an alternative nationalist ideology based mainly on the following motto: "You cannot obtain anything without violence". Finally, Unciti concludes that the nationalist refuse to say what they believe in publicly and he scarcely considers it possible to extend the supreme fatherland of Euskadi from its current borders to other areas such as Navarre, La Rioja and some southern provinces in France. Essay arguing against the article: Everybody agrees that "The Basque problem" has always been an untouchable question for many people living in Spain. Now that weapons are in silence and that there are not terrorist acts any more, it seems that people have suddenly started to talk freely and give their own opinions about this problem, mainly about a final pacification in the Basque Country. The absence of corpses on the pavements makes it possible for us to state our own beliefs not so cautiously as before, but with a great freedom longed so much by the Basque society. It is obvious that not everybody agrees with the rest of the people, but there are always many divergences. Above all, when we deal with the idea of independence and the right of self-determination for the Basque Country. Manuel de Unciti, a famous priest and journalist, does not support this idea and he blames the nationalist for not being able to set up a dialogue between them and the central government in Madrid. My aim in this article is to argue against this and other opinions of him and also state my own. To begin with, I really think that it is likely to establish an encouraging dialogue between the two parts that will lead everything to the right road. No blame attaches to the Basque nationalists when they are accused of not bringing this dialogue to a successful conclusion., but it is the central government who actually must shoulder the responsibilities. It does not show signs of raising "the Basque question" in its most radical causes and it keeps being stubborn with the idea that nobody can put a high price to peace. The current Spanish government led by José María Aznar, resists to accept that the matter pending between Euskadi and the rest of Spain is mainly of a political nature. All initiatives of advance from the central government, praised so much by many mass media in Madrid, prove ineffective. In a way, they sabotage the process of peace in the Basque Country since Aznar does not want to change the penitentiary politics and absolutely refuses to build up a meeting forum without exclusions. Even the violent ones (those who committed terrorist acts in the past) must be there. Everybody has to listen to what the others believe in and the political dialogue has to be carried out without any kind of pre-conditions. Secondly, I believe that independence from Spain is not a utopia, as Unciti asserts. On the contrary, it is something feasible. We, the Basque, constitute a single nation. We have our own culture, our own customs and above all, our own language (Euskera) completely different from the rest of the languages which are spoken in Spain. Thus, we should aspire to achieve a cultural unity. It is that the current European integrating political movements make independence from Spain difficult but at least, it would be possible for us to obtain the right of self-determination as a country including our own legislation in every field. In addition, I do not want here to take a radical and unreasonable attitude against what is Spanish. I accept that we still have many bonds with Spain, but it is obvious that we must defend what is ours. Independence will probably bring a final pacification to the Basque Country. A pluralist society will be established and the people living in it will live in harmony. Everybody will listen to what the others think and so, will accept all different opinions. What is more, violence will finish. It is once again a responsibility of the central government in Madrid to put an end to this situation that divides a whole nation and also puts the two parts living together face to face. Lastly and closely related to the idea of independence is the idea of a supreme fatherland for Euskadi. The latter has to be extended from its current borders to other areas such as Navarre, some southern provinces of France, La Rioja and Huesca. Unciti refuses to accept this suggestion. He says it is "an stimulating dream" of the Basque and he explains that few people believe this possible, In a way it is, though there are, of course, many difficulties. It is said that France will never give any province or territory from its fatherland to the Basque and besides, it is backed up by the European Community. It is also true that there is a minimal part of the population that cherishes independence in those French provinces, but I personally feel that a referendum should be done to know the opinion the population. If we look back on the past, we see that the old Basque Country consisted of all the previous provinces together with the current ones (Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa and Araba) which were linked by their own customs and language. Basque nationalists do not use demagogy as a political means or weapon, but they only try to bring up a future of grandeur for the Basque Country and its people. In conclusion, it is the great majority of the Basque people that wishes to work hard for a definite pacification in Euskadi. We are living a historical moment of peace right now and we must keep it forever. Everybody has to respect his opponent and make it possible to grant all the cessions needed. Now, pacification requires the establishment of a dialogue without pre-conditions and without exclusions. I am fully convinced that, with the passage of time and without violence, everything will be firmly put in its right place and problems will be given their true weight to discuss them more objectively.$$$﻿ Why has the level of alcohol taking increased so much in the Spanish teenagers? Alcohol taking in Spain is on a considerable increase as regards those who are under age in our society. The present situation has become almost untenable and now the time has come to do something as both the Spanish government and the media indicate continuously. However, this is not a problem originated just a moment ago, but we should find its stems in the basis of our own Spanish society. We have not realized yet what was happening very close to us. Now that the level of alcohol taking is without any doubt alarming, it would be reasonable to pick out some possible causes for this problem. The media have suggested several causes and among them, one stands out against the rest: the government, they say, does not control neither pubs nor bars where they go on selling alcohol to the under-aged. The latter really find it easy to have a drink or two or even to get drunk for the first time in their lives. The owners of those places only look after their own interests and above all, they look after their economy. They would probably complain that they do not win enough money to pay everything they must pay as they are fully endowed with taxes. This is what many journalists in Spain have upheld in their articles. Another reason that the media in Spain have also revealed as possible and that has been this time corroborated by those children' s parents is that of the more than probable unconcern the latter have with regard to their children's education, habits and manners. Many of the problems originated at home create certain confusions in the mentality of the affected ones, who really feel demoralized and find a refuge in the end. This refuge is obviously alcohol. Those parents do not realize that they have caused the problem beforehand and very often, ironically, they quit from their own blames and even say that they find it almost impossible to have their children under control all the time. The reason, they say, is that you can never know what your child is doing outside home and thus, whatever moment you can say: "He' s done me!" Still many sociologists indicate that it is about time to raise the conscience of the parents for a greater control of their children. However, the main cause for this increase is, from my point of view, the desire to imitate, the desire to have a new experience (the first drunkenness), because they can see it everywhere and would like to feel as the grown-ups do. They want to feel superior to the rest of the people and thus, not being limited any more. This remarkable desire for freedom is due to: the presence of a society completely based on alcohol, the development of advertising campaigns concerning alcohol and again, the little consideration of the family towards their children. First, just investigating in the past times of the Spanish society, we can find that it has always been eminently related to alcohol. Spain has always tended to have people who really like to have a good wine or a beer in a pub all nights or even our past banquets were full of wine and some other drinks. If we asked our parents what did they usually do when they were young, if they did the same or not, they would probably answer like this: "Ok, Yes but not so young as it happens now. In fact, we were more innocent people." Below this historic assumption, well -known by the tourists and foreigners in Spain, that urge for imitation and superiority is very well hidden in it. Secondly, the development of advertising campaigns on the TV which include alcohol in their sales, contribute to strengthen this problem even more. As many sociologists say, when that child sits on the sofa and watches the ads on the TV, that desire for knowing the taste of what has just been shown on the TV is really created in him. Perhaps, he has already seen his parents do that before. As a result of this, everything goes back again to that idea of the unconcern of the parents who do not know how to give their children a good education and bring it to a successful conclusion. A few solutions are of course needed, but now it is not the time to look for them. Maybe some special campaigns too should be done to help those parents! In conclusion, as we have seen, there is an enormous increase in the number of the under-aged people in Spain drinking too much alcohol. It is a present problem without any sort of solution ahead, but a full study of this causes and, of course, a little bit of common sense will do the rest.
EE235	1	﻿ Public Service Television compared to private broadcasting. Until a couple of years ago only two channels on the television here in Sweden existed and those were the public service ones. Today there is an incredible number of channels, private and financed by advertisers they represent today the most watched; the public service channels have had to step aside. In these days of private owned broadcasting companies one has to ask oneself if this is something that affects what remains of public service television. During the last five years or so there has been a lot of debate about the quality of programs. The less serious programs shown on private owned broadcasting companies tend to attract a larger audience than the more serious ones shown on the public service channels. What does the public service broadcasting add to our lives in front of the television that the private owned broadcasting companies does not provide? The debate about the so called quality of the programs shown on television seems to split into two camps whereas one is mostly concerned about the numbers of how many that actually watch a show; a program has to be profitable if it shall be sent. The other is mostly concerned about what is being shown; the message and the effects of the program. Traditionally, and perhaps correctly, one thinks of the second group as the defenders of public service channels and the first group as the ones who claim that free competition is the best way also when it comes to broadcasting. When private owned broadcasting companies first appeared in Sweden a couple of years ago, the younger part of the population (from my experience) were mostly interested in these channels, maybe because the charm of the novelty, maybe because of their different choice of programs. The public service channels came to be considered as something boring reserved for very old people or for the very youngest. A short period then appeared when there were much talk about changing the public service channels; to make them more like the private broadcasting companies. This was probably because the public channels wanted to change their reputation of making programs only for elderly and children. However, any actual major changes in the programs were not noticed and everything continued very much in the same way as before. One thing that became different with the private companies introduced to the market was the task for the public service broadcasting; them being the only broadcaster directly connected to the state and therefore having another responsibility of the message sent by their programs but also having the responsibility of sending educational programs. This was not something new, but something that differed and still differs the public service broadcasting from the other broadcasters. The public service channels receives its money from the state and is therefore not obliged to present any especially successful numbers to be able to continue their business. This is a privilege that the private broadcasters cannot enjoy since they are depending on money from advertisers that want successful numbers if to continue the support of the channel. This makes the private companies see it all in a much more commercial perspective compared to the public service broadcasting that must consider its programs in another perspective, as I have mentioned above, since not depending on money from advertisers but from the state. Today the public service channels represent in most peoples eyes not boring programs but good programs whereas the private channels that used to be considered to be the more entertaining ones still are so but does not have the same status. The public service channels have an important function as the only independent broadcaster in Sweden, that is; not paid or owned by a commercial company, they are dependent if you regard their relationship with the state. The wider range of the types of programs and of the subjects in the programs differ them from the commercial broadcasters and therefore makes them having a singular position in the Swedish world of television channels. Luckily the private broadcasters have not changed anything but the numbers in the audience of the programs of the public service channels.$$$﻿Words, words, words. What word could possibly describe the hard work of learning a foreign language better? I started to learn English as my first foreign language at the age of nine, and at that age the studies of language basically consisted of learning words. How to spell them, how to pronounce them and how to use them. We also learnt the most basic phrases, like "My name is...", "What time is it?" and so on. The teacher was always eager to tell us how important it was to learn lots and lots of words, but, speaking about myself, I know that this was something I did not quite understand until I first visited an English-speaking country. My first visit to England with my family learned me that when going to the supermarket, you cannot ask the staff for Swedish grocery-brands, like "O'boy". Another thing that also turned out to be almost always impossible was to use the Swedish word for a vegetable, for example, but pronouncing the word in an English way. So, at the age of ten I realised that words really were just as important as the teacher had told me at school. The phrases I had learnt was not really useful at that moment since I did not always understand the answers to the questions. After all the word practice, the English-classes tended to be some kind of concentrated word and translating sentences course. At the "gymnasiet", we had lots of grammar lessons, I could not tell you what we were up to all these grammar lessons, but I do remember having them. Every now and then, the teacher tried to make us speak as well, but most of the students (including myself) found it a bit ridiculous and artificial to make up a subject just for the aim of trying to discuss it in English. I suppose that it had to do with our age, since I do not find it that ridiculous today. So, for me it took some time before I actually spoke English, but once started I realised the fun in getting familiar with another extra language. Why only have access to one when you can have more than that? Lately, or the last three or four years, I think that my English has developed a great deal. After finishing the "gymnasiet" it was as if some kind of psychological barrier loosened up when it came to speak foreign languages. With the English but also with the French, it suddenly became a lot easier. When I went to England to visit my sister, who moved there a couple of years ago, I started to converse with her friends instead of just listening, hoping that nobody would start talking to me, mind you, I might would have had to say something. Anyway, the years of only listening to English, have made me good at following conversations, if I am to say something positive about it. I do not know if it has to do with increased simultaneous ability, but today I cannot only listen to a conversation but also take part in it. Some progress! As progress has been made in speaking and listening, I tend to read more in English as well. Maybe because I prefer to read books in their original language, if possible. What is good about reading in English, is the fact that you are exposed to many words, if speaking about that again. But it surely is useful to learn lots of them, as my teacher once said. And you are also exposed to many new expressions, which is funny, and good, to know. I cannot think of anything more irritating than being in the middle of a discussion and then, suddenly someone utters an expression you are not familiar with, or a word. I speak English on a rather frequent basis since my sister is settled in England but also because my parents have English, or Scottish, neighbours who I see a lot when I am at home. I guess the writing-part is the one I am the least good at, probably because I do not practice that very often. But since my experience of learning languages is, so far, that "practice makes perfect". I hope that this will apply to learning how to write well in English as well.
EE038	0	﻿ STATE CARE CANNOT REPLACE FAMILY CARE Society has failed of taking satisfactory care of the elderly. Municipals are not able to provide its old inhabitants apartments and even as I write, some five thousand of them stand without proper living arrangements. It's also known that this group is steadily growing in our society. More and more money and recourses are needed. At the same time the number of those being in working life declines. I think that the best solution to this problem is that families themselves provide care for their older members, at least in some extent. Would you like to spend the last years of your life sitting in a closet-size room, only having the next bingo session to look forward to? I assume you wouldn't. This is however reality for many elderly today. Growing old is something one almost ought to feel ashamed of. Perhaps if we spent more time with the elderly and took care of them ourselves, maybe then we would once again learn not to be afraid of ageing and instead we might, just might, realise that good things also come with it, namely experience and wisdom. The benefits this would bring to the elderly themselves are easily imagined. Every one of us has the basic need for feeling useful, preferable to some other human being. Grandma could assist in some lighter every-day chores, such as minding her grandchildren. It would certainly be nice for her to now that someone still needs her and enjoys her company. A very nice side effect of this would be the children then being able to stay a little longer in a warm and safe home environment instead of being sent away to day care institutions as early as at the age of one, not to mention all those things they could learn from the older generation. Let's return to the closet-sized rooms and the obvious lack of something to occupy the residents with. I'm sure that those who work at these institutions and homes are very capable craftsmen and that they do the best they can. They are indeed able to provide for their customers basic needs. Still, there simply isn't enough time for social interaction such as sitting down for a talk, mainly due to the lack of staff. To make it possible for families to have their parents at home, the time spent at work ought to be shortened. Regarding the situation today there isn't even enough time to spend with ones children after a long eight- hour day at work. If this was done there would automatically be more openings in the job- market and unemployment figures would go down. Society would save that huge amount of money that goes to maintain all these institutions and could preferably transfer some of the saved money to the equally huge healthcare costs. As long as any diseases don't trouble the old member of the family, care at home is to prefer, but professionals of course better give medical care. As I have shown so far there are great benefits both individually and socially. I'm sure though, that you already have formed some counter arguments in your mind. One of them might be how we are supposed to manage economically if we only work six hours per day? With more mouths to fill there has to be an increase in income as well. But then again, one might wonder if we really need to consume as much as we do today? Couldn't we try lowering our cost of living? Surely it's not all that important to have the most expensive house, car and so forth? I'm well aware of that in order to make these suggestions come true we would probably have to go some hundred years back in time. We have somehow lost our feeling of belonging together as families. Partly I would like to blame the society we are living in for that; the haunt for money and success has made us greedy and egoistic. However it's extremely important for preserving humanity that we once again start taking care of each other!$$$﻿ Democracy, a delusion? A short critique of present-day liberalism Introduction Once democracy was considered a tool for changing people's hard life conditions to the better. It was seen as the ultimate instrument to attain political power from the ruling classes. To be allowed to vote was one of the primary goals in the working class struggle for social justice. It has been more and more apparent that democracy has lost its attraction as a means of fighting against injustices in society. Democracy has nowadays proved to be a very insufficient method to achieve and fulfill what people need and wish to become true. Why is that so? Maybe a hint to the answer could be found at Marshall Berman, the author of the book "All that is settled and established evaporates", where he discusses the conditions of life in modern society. His main point and leading idea is that "the dynamics of modern economy, and the culture that emerges from this economy, annihilates everything it creates - physical environments, social institutions, metaphysical ideas, artistic visions, moral values - in order to continue its creation, with the purpose of incessantly recreating the world." "This striving is pulling all modern men and women into its circle and will thus force us all to struggle with what is essential, meaningful and real in the whirl in which we move and live." What is then "The Good Life"? A human being needs to live in a generous social context all his life in love and fellowship. He or she might also need to develop and create freely, both intellectually and artistically. However, the basis for all this is what nature offers to man, if it remains unspoilt: Fresh air, clean water, nutrients, food, clothes, housing, warmth and shelter, and possibly a means of transportation as well as medical cures and medicins. In a market economy material products could be bought, if enough money is available but only then. The details of what "The Good Life" is likely to be, may be disputed, but I want to argue that "The Good Life" is approximately the way I have just pictured, and that the premises of this good life is endangered if not spoilt by the system we have to live in. Does the present economic and political system allow for a realisation of "The Good Life"? What social relations follow from the working conditions? Do they contribute to "The Good Life" or do they on the contrary counteract the realisation of man's self fulfillment. During some decades after the great depression in the beginning of the 1930's, the economic growth had hardly any earlier equivalent and the social change was enormous after the preceding decades with the full emergence of democracy. Democracy in crisis From the 1970's onwards it has become evident that the institution of democracy has suffered heavily from successive degradation, as a parallel and simultaneous process to the deregulation of markets and the breaking up of what was called the "welfare state". The democracy institution is more and more falling short when it comes to the remedy and relief of human suffering, poverty and social exclusion, a constantly growing segregation, ill-health and lacking well-being as well as growing social isolation. It is increasingly impossible to get rid of politicians that persist in implementing harmful policies. Politicians and other important decision-makers cannot be held responsible with the help of the ballot-paper. People in general have to resign as mere lookers-on, passive witnesses to the present degeneration of politics. The result is stress, frustration, illness, crime, drug abuse and a gigantic environmental disaster. Other manifestations of this decay of politics and democracy is the dismantling of the pension system and different social insurance systems. People have paid for their pensions and other social security benefits during their whole professional life and are now deprived of the fruits of their hard labour. Instead they are now requested to pay a second time by means of private insurance systems. We are also expected to play Russian roulette with our pityful rests of the state pensions on the stock market! The decadence of politics is also espressed in the tax system. While decision-makers feather their nests at people's expense, every serious attempt to save money is hampered by new and increased tax duties. The state has a ravenous and almost unlimited appetite and people are thus forced to work like mad to earn their living. I contend that "democracy by now is dead" in the sense that it would be an instrument for real improvement of all the shortcomings that is inherent in the present political and economic system. The programs of the political parties have converged into a limited set of empty dogmas that, when brought into practice, seem to entail no responsibility concerning their consequences. To cut down inflation and reduce politics to nonsense stereotypes on television appear to be the common denominator for the political parties. The parties on the right-wing call for "freedom of choice" and "tax reductions", but they carefully avoid to discuss how poor people would be able to finance their pensions, health insurances, loss of income insurances, dental service insurances and all other necessary insurances that less poor people consider indispensable. The socialdemocrats and their political supporters of different colours are on the other hand presenting another formula, "Public medical service, eldercare and school resources", but the problem seems to be the same: How will it be possible for low-income people to save enough money for their living, when the enormous taxes and charges undermine vital savings. The so-called citizen is squeezed in a Moment 22: The more he or she is trying to save, the faster the savings are eroded. The less he or she is able to keep, the more they will fall down into dependence of the whims and fancies of the state or wither away into the faceless flock of political cattle. Whatever party the man in the street is voting for, he is voting against himself. In exactly this meaning democracy is well on the way of dying. There are no obvious political alternatives to the present neo-liberalism, even though the rhetoric may differ in the parliament and elsewhere. The gap between the reality of your own wallet as well as your own life conditions and the empty stream of words that flow out of the politicians' mouths is widening with a terrifying speed. In Encyclopedia Britannica modernity is depicted as follows: "Since its inception, modernity has worn two faces. One is dynamic, forward-looking and progressive, promising unprecedented abundance, freedom and fulfillment. The other, equally visible face is grim, revealing the new problems of alienation, poverty, crime and pollution." What does this Janus-face-description stand for? Already in 1776, when Adam Smith had his Wealth of Nations published, the foundation was laid for the theory that "the mechanism of the invisible hand" will eventually lead to the best of worlds, as long as each individual strived the hardest he could for his own good. Is this really a good theory? It rather seems as if "the mechanism of the grabbing hand" is the root of the modern world. Modernity implies a job splitting process that has developed to the degree that people more and more live in subcultures, despite the revolution of the massmedia and the information technology. The greater the number of subcultures and the more different they are from one another, the more alien people might become before each other. The question is, if irresponsibility and indifference follow from this process and what the consequences are regarding democracy. What happens to people when they aren't able anymore to understand other people and feel the way they do? It is almost as when an air-craft pilot in battle fires-off his bomb-load by simply pressing his button. He will never see the direct consequences of his action and therefore possibly loses his ability to feel pity for his victims. In somewhat the same position the powerful people find themselves in modernity as well as their theoretical liberal strategists within the political and economic disciplines. A restoration of democracy would call for a revival of empathy and a renewed ability to denominate "the actors of the world scene and its course of events" in a true way. The schizofrenic split between the theory and praxis of liberalism of today is, I venture to say, one of the most fatal questions of the future of mankind.
EE035	0	﻿ Is the Swedish Language replaced as Main Language in Sweden in 100 years? The question is relevant to ask. There are an increasing number of fields in the society where Swedish is not used as the nomenclature. It is also common that existing Swedish words are replaced by English words in areas where it is not necessary. There are tremendous risks with a native language being undermined, risks which will not be discussed here, but instead the causes of this trend will be discussed. I start with the main cause since many of the other causes depend on it. As I see it the main reason is the globalisation. People around the world need to communicate with each other. All kinds of business areas are increasingly depending on the whole world as a market. People, universities and companies live in an international world where there is a need for a common language and English has become this universal language. As a consequence nomenclature that is related to specialised professions often is English. Here we can see several examples, for instance, within journalism we find words like Public Service and stringer; we can see worlds related to economy and finance such as controller, day trader and revenue; and within Medicine words like stroke, whiplash, frozen shoulder etc. are used. Yet another example is the widely spread terminology used in relation with Information Technology. Fewer and fewer Swedish academic theses are written in Swedish. And technical and other specialist literature produced in Sweden are nowadays often written in English. Here it is reasonable to suspect that there is not only a demand for professional communication that can be seen as the reason, but also that there is an economic reason. It is cheaper to write in English since the translation costs then can be excluded. When technical and other specialised nomenclature propagate outside its faculties it the foreign words are most commonly accepted in the society. We also see lots of examples where Swedish is abandoned for English in areas directed to people and their consumption. Such as Lindex, and other multiple chain stores, abandon rea for sale. Many of us are also familiar with commercials for diapers where we have seen words like Baby Dry, Up & Go and Boy / Girl. Further examples are Refill, Wash & Go etc. How come English is used in areas where there does not seem to be a need for English? Once again the answer surely is economic reasons. Since, for instance, commercial campaigns are simplified if the same product names can be used wherever the products are sold. Thus, I assume this is a phenomenon we have to get used to. It is also interesting to reflect on why people so eagerly accept and adopt English. Is it because people think Swedish expressions are watered-down? Is there a need for freshness and modernisation, which the Swedish language cannot provide? Because of the enormous influx in areas like music, movies and idols it seems to be a tendency, especially among young people to adopt not only the language but also the culture. When the foreign culture, especially the American, is accepted also the language is accepted. A good example of this is the newly imported Halloween tradition. The acceptance is not likely to decrease since children nowadays also get used to English very early. I am thinking of the use of computer games, TV set games and the TV programmes for children that are not dubbed to Swedish. Whatever the reasons might be, the Swedish people's willingness to frequently use English instead of their native language must also be seen as a cause for the discussed trend. Within parenthesis it can here be appropriate to mention that there are lots of efforts made in Sweden in order to nurse the language, for instance, the work done by the Swedish Datatermgruppen. This is a voluntary society without ties started by Svenska. They make an effort to find Swedish terms for the nomenclature related to Information Technology. Even though their work is vigorous it is doubtful whether they, together with other actions taken so far, will succeed in stopping the on-going progress. To summarise, even if it is too early to say definitely that the Swedish language will have been replaced as main language in 100 years, one can however, definitely see that there is a trend of the Swedish language being undermined in area after area in the society. Because of this trend it could also be interesting to reflect on the risks with this trend and hence also consider which actions that might be needed. But I leave that out for the moment!$$$﻿ THE GROWTH OF NAZISM IN SOCIETY During the last couple of decades the nazi - ideas have got new strength in societies all over Europe. Extreme right-wing parties have got new, stronger position in political life and win more and more voters. The latest example is the Austrian FP party's entrance into the government through its extreme leader Jorg Haider. It got 27 percent of the votes. Sweden has not been speared from this trend either, though there are not this kind of political parties that have gained any power in Sweden. Because nazism is getting stronger even in Sweden it would be interesting to try to find out what possible reasons can explain this trend in society. The reason which I will present first because it seems to be the most obvious is unemployment. The argument is often used and according to it during an economic crisis people tend to see strangers as a threat, because they are consider to take the jobs from the people who were born here. It is probably the most used argument by nazis themselves when trying to justify their believes and actions. The same argument was used in Nazi German before and during the Second World War, but was mostly direct toward the Jews. It was claimed that they were taking money and work from the Germans. Nevertheless, this explanation, namely that the lack of job opportunities should be the cause of increased nazi sympathies, is not completely satisfactory. For example, the newspaper Expressen has investigated the spread of nazi organisations in Sweden and discovered that they are most numerous in the southern and central parts of Sweden, where job opportunities are biggest and the rarest in the northern part of Sweden where unemployment is greatest. Though the unemployment and the economic crisis can be considered as an important cause of growing nazism there must be further causes of it. The hatred of foreigners could be another cause. It is often hidden and difficult to see but is probably more spread than one could think. This hatred is a germ of deeper and more dangerous feelings and thoughts that can often be identified as nazism. It is human fear of strange, unusual and unknown things that lies behind it. And foreigners tend to be strange and unusual, at least in some peoples' opinion. But there has always been foreigners in this country, as well as in all others countries. On the other hand, the number of people with nazi sympathies varies and is now increasing. So this single reason cannot give the complete explanation of the phenomenon. Although the hatred of foreigners cannot give a complete explanation of the growth or nazism it cannot be ignored. The belief that foreigners cost the state a lot of money is widely spread, as well as the belief that they do not want to get a job and are simply taking advantage of the social assistance system. It is not difficult to understand why these beliefs are so common - foreigners do have difficulties to get a job because of the lack of education as well as the poor knowledge of the language. Besides, they are easy to discern from the rest. Like the most of the arguments this one has its counter-argument as well. The statistics shows that those beliefs are completely baseless and are in fact nothing else but prejudices. However, this information based on the statistics is often spread via media and most of people are familiar with the true facts. Therefore one could argue that this could not be a reason for the growth of nazism. Clearly it is difficult to identify the reasons of the increasing number of nazi sympathies and organisations in society. The most probable reason is in fact the combination of the reasons mentioned above. Both the unemployment, hatred of foreigners and prejudices are the parts of the trend that is observable in today's society.
EE434	1	﻿ Why hunting is necessary A never-ending discussion in Sweden these days is the question whether it is right to kill and eat animals. In the centre of this discussion is the production animals such as cattle, pigs and poultry. I am going to concentrate on another debate, a little more peripheral, which concerns the game and our right to hunt and kill it. Hunting has a long history in human evolution. We were hunters long before we became farmers. Today no one has to hunt to survive though. Instead hunters are often seen as a bunch of merciless murderers (primarily men) who kills innocent animals for their own pleasure. Even people who eat meat themselves can ask me how I can stand killing an animal in cold blood. The irony of that question sometimes makes me want to laugh since it is my opinion that all humans participate in killing the animals they eat. The only difference is that I, as a hunter, do it openly. One of the problems all hunters including me have is that we do it for fun. There is no denying it. For people who do not know hunting this may seem to be the same as enjoy killing. Before anything else this has to be straightened out. The killing of the game is only an extremely short moment of the whole hunt. The lifestyle of hunters includes so much more. I have a friend who crawled around on his stomach for several hours just so he could get a chance to shoot a goose. He failed and had to go home empty handed. If his only interest had been killing he could have chosen something easier to hunt. Bringing up a dog, watching it grow and training it to be able to use it as a hunting partner someday is also a part of many hunters life which involves no killing. Enjoying hunting may be an emotionally important issue in this debate, but practically there is something more important. While humans has taken over the land and used it for farming the predators in our land, bears and wolves for example, has been almost extinct. In many parts of Sweden there are no natural enemies left to balance the numbers of our bigger games such as elk and roe deer. Hunting is therefore an important part of the game-preserving. Economically it is very important because of the damages that wild animals make to the growing forests. Keeping an even and not to big fauna is also necessary to control different diseases, which can be spread both to humans and dogs. Practical and economical reasons are easy to discuss. The ethical part whether it is right or wrong to kill animals for food is harder. Personally I think we have that right. It has to be under good conditions though. In the society we live in today economy determines a lot of things and the value of a good life often comes in second hand, not only for animals, but in some cases even for humans. That is why hunting is very important for me. The animals I hunt have, for good or bad, lived their lives as natural as possible. My biggest responsibility is to kill them as clean as possible. That responsibility seems to be too much for some people to handle. There are always going to be persons who hurt animals when hunting because they are careless. The majority of the hunters in Sweden have a good education and a lot of common sense and care for their game, as they should. Personally I only hunt animals that I eat, but I do not object to people who doesn't follow this. The increase of tourist and business hunting frightens me because I am afraid those persons may not always have the right knowledge that is required for safe hunting. This argumentation will probably not convince the real anti hunters but I hope it can spread some light for the common people who never been in touch with the lifestyle of the hunters.$$$﻿ TV-the nanny of the 21th century Since it's entry into our homes in the mid 20th century the TV's role in our lives has grown. Today it is the role model for many young people, who watch the world mainly via the screen. The TV, instead of parents, has become the one to tell us what is important, how to act and what to look like. As a result kids are getting fatter from lack of exercise, while anorexia is spreading. Children are getting killed by other children. How can it be that such a great instrument for learning and understanding has become our biggest enemy? any kids learn from a very young age to deal with the TV at home. They know how to handle the remote even before they've stopped using diapers. After a couple of years Nintendo and Playstation takes place under the TV, alongside with the video or DVD-player. Why do parents allow their children to spend so much time with television? The answer is quite easy. Kids who watch television don't run around and make a lot of noise and mess. The TV has become a nanny. The parents can do whatever they want to do while the kids watch TV or play videogames. I recently went to a party a friend was having. One of the guests had to bring her children along because she had no babysitter. To solve the problem she brought a video tape the children could watch so they wouldn't be in the way. It may sound as if parents nowadays don't want to be together with their children. This is of course not true. The economy of a family often demands that both parents work full time. After work there is cleaning, cooking, washing and more that have to be done at home. Spending time with children becomes a low priority chore and family business has to wait until weekends. The question is does it really matter that kids watch a lot of TV? In America this question has been raised after a couple of serious crimes (murders) commited by young children. The blame is often laid on violent and bloody movies and video games, but is it really that easy? It is not right to assume that kids can distinguish between the real world and the world of TV and video games without someone to guide them. We have to remember that even if we are humans we are still animals as well. Just like other mammals our kids learn how to act by watching and mimicing grown-ups. There are other problems alongside the violence. TV very often has a narrow perspective of people's looks. On MTV, in soap operas and many other shows young people watch, the only way to look as a girl is to be thin, preferably with big breasts. For men it is important to be tall and muscular. As a result girls, not yet teenagers, want to operate their breasts, while boys are caught eating steroides. The responsibility for what kids watch on TV and how much they watch lies of course with the parents. To forbid the use of TV wouldn't really solve anything. One must not forget that TV is our biggest source of information. That makes it an amazing tool for doing things you normally could not do. Via the TV one can travel all over the world, meet all kinds of different cultures, learn languages, take trips thru time both to the past and the future and much more. When treated right it is a valuable tool in school as well as home. The problem is that our society today demands a lot from people. Everyone is supposed to do eveything everyone else does. There is no wonder kids are forgotten, since they seldom complain. If parents (and other grown-ups as well) take their responsibility and take better care for what children watch on TV and maybe even join them and explain things, the world might look different. It is worth a try because like it or not, we're stuck with TV.
EE339	0	﻿ English, my English! I believe that I always have enjoyed English. The language became my second tonuge in a very natural way, as my mother has been a teacher in English. She began rather early to encourage me to adapt the language by teaching me that our "katt" in English was a "cat" and that our "hund" in fact was a "dog". I found it very amusing to learn all these strange words and did my best to remember them. The first time I went abroad was at the age of eight, when my mother and I went to London. At that age, my knowledge of English was not all that impressing, but the trip inspired me and encouraged me to learn more. You might say that my appetite for English was whetted. During the years I and my family have travelled quite a lot abroad, we have for instance visited the US, Africa and Asia. When I was younger I did not feel confident enough to participate in the conversation, instead I was content with listening to all the disussions I heard around me. Quite soon I realized that I understood a great deal of what was beeing said, and as I grew older and got more experience I dared to open my mouth and make myself heard. Of course it felt rather awkward at first, talking without really knowing the right words, wondering over grammar and pronunciation and so forth, but I realized that the essential thing was that I commuicated whith other people and that nobody would penalize me if I did not speak absolutely correctly. When we went on our first safari in Kenya, for instace, I was more or less forced to talk English, because of the fact that the whole group travelling with us was British. During our latest holidays I have felt rather secure chatting and discussing in English. I have, though, no intention at all to declare that my English is perfect - on the contrary - there are many things left to correct. For instance, when you go abroad and talk to the native habitants of the country you are visiting, it is not very likely that they talk any better English than you yourself. The important thing is that you are able to communicate in a proper way, and that you have the confidence needed to talk and express your opinions. I gather that my pronunciation is a mix of British and American English. That is, first of all, due to the fact that most of the movies shown on television are American. I think that it is quite obvious that you adapt to what you hear every day on the telly. On the other hand speaks my mother with British accent, as she has lived in the UK a couple of years, and she has always tried to make me talk Britsh English. Our teachers at school have also mostly been speaking British. I must confess that personally I prefer the cool British accent to the American accent. Listening to British English makes me feel pleased in a strange way, I really can not explain it properly. Therefore I always try to follow the British series of superintendet Morse on the telly. Partly because of the wonderful way they speak, but also, of course, because of the staggering intrigues. I think that it is quite easy to understand spoken English, but there are of course different kinds of spoken English. I find it terribly annoying to listen to politicians because of their complicated language and all the twists and turns they make in order only to confuse their audience. Som dialects are also terribly hard to understand - take cockney, for example. I hardly get a word of it. Reading English has though hardly ever caused me any problems. I began reading in English at the age of fifteen and I have continued ever after. My favourite author in English is Minette Walters, I enjoy her subtle language and twisted intrigues. There are of course also many differents sorts of written English - interpreting documentary reports or scientific newspapers may sometimes cause me a great deal of difficulty. When it comes to writing in English - well, I can hardly stop writing when I once have got started. At school we were only allowed to write essays consisting of 150 - 200 words, limits which I found i terribly difficult to restrict myself to. I choose this course in order to get a more complex image of English and the English-speaking countries. I have no intention to become a teacher in English, but I have realized how terribly important the knowledge of languages is.$$$﻿ Fruit is evil As we all know, bad health is one of the greatest threats to the wealth of the western world. Overweight, sickness associated with too high cholesterol values, constant tiredness and exhaustion are well-known problems most commonly caused by inappropriate manners in eating. Many blame fast food and lack of descent cooking for this, but I'd like to point out another, much worse felon: fruit. Most people claim that this is an essential part of a nutritious diet, but I will prove such is not the case. 15 months ago, I deliberately ceased to eat all kinds of raw fruit. The result: I feel great. I do agree that fruits contain many vitamins that are necessary for physical well-being, but these could easily be found elsewhere (in vegetables and pills for instance; the latter is by the way a very rational source, since a pill a day is all you need to swallow). What made me an opponent to fruit eating, however, was a profound consideration of certain human aspects. Almost all fruit consumed here is grown in gigantic plantations, in many ways similar to Nazi concentration camps. Bananas and oranges are forced to grow up in a totally unnatural environment, where intoxication of both themselves and the people collecting them is common due to the implementation of chemicals. After reaching desirable sizes, the fruits are transported in such great misery it makes the shipping of slaves in the 1700s look almost luxurious. Apart from being intoxicated, plantation workers suffer seriously because of hazardous wages, working and living conditions. One might wonder whether those working at the plantations really have a choice. At the moment, I'm afraid they don't, since the countries they live in are mostly poorly developed ones. The underdevelopment of fruit producing countries is of utmost interest. May it not be that these countries are poor because they grow fruit? You might think that this isn't a realistic thought, but I dare say, it is surely a thrilling one. Of course, all exporters of fruit aren't poor. New Zealand and Israel, for instance, are wealthy nations that sell a considerable amount of oranges and apples. I reckon this has two major reasons: most importantly, there are a lot of foreign workers here, who don't think getting well paid is a prerequisite (that probably goes for the typical Kibbutz worker). Furthermore, wealthy fruit-growers were already in possession of a highly developed infrastructure before they started exporting the controversial goods. Poor exporters have hardly got anything one could call infrastructure, and therefor get locked into a pattern. In order to break that pattern the country needs new industries, something that often requires foreign investments. Such are usually hard to attract if your infrastructure is poor. An evil circle, indeed, and fruit is to blame. However, the actual sinner isn't the fruit itself, but us, eating it without having a thought of what we're really doing. Celebrating the suffering of others, that is. Undemocratic, corrupted governments get our support. In fact, we are paying for the imprisonment of fruits and workers. This is obviously unknown to most fruit-eaters; at least I hope so. Otherwise, nearly everyone in the western world has got a certain amount of fascistic sympathies. If that is the case, I am deeply terrified of what shapes this could take in the future. Who is nothing but a fruit-eater today, might be the Himmler of next decade. This terrible future scenario could easily be avoided. Human beings do not need fruit. I know this for sure, since no fruit whatsoever has passed my throat for over a year. My intellect is at its peak, and I hardly ever get a cold. There might be people out there who couldn't give up fruit eating because of the taste, but as I recall, there are no tasty fruits. What strikes me is that many vegetarians have stopped eating cows because of the same reasons that stopped my eating fruit. I find this rather curious, since it's obvious that a cow pacing the rich fields of Scania suffers less than a trapped banana in a miserable Latin American plantation. By now, I really hope I've convinced you that eating fruit is simply wrong. There is no point in it, and it causes pain. Please join me in my struggle. Do not eat fruit!
EE338	1	﻿ Fifteen years ago I learned my first phrase in the English language. Since then I have done continous improvement and I would say at first thought that I know English pretty good. Altough, there is always room for more skills to be taught and these skills which I still lack can only be found through evaluating more in detail how good my English is at this point. Therefore I will here try to evaluate my English, breaking it into the four parts of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The speaking part is probably the one where I feel most confident. I made a lot of improvement in my speaking a couple of years ago, spending a year in Canadian High School. Of course, much of this speaking was normal day talk between friends and family, which have affected my language to be more simple than what was taught to me in Swedish school. Also, my accent went from the British school English taught in Sweden, to a Canadian midwest accent. I do feel though, that my speaking is fluently alright and at least in Canada accepted by most people. Listening skills are very different depending on the situation. I would say I can have a one to one talk with any English speaking person rather easy. It is always easier when you are able to show in some way which parts you understand more and which parts have to be told differently. But when you do not have this contact with the speaker, it is much more difficult. I would think that my own listening skills are good though. I can understand the meaning of proper English and as far as American and British English, I can also catch the mood and sense the underlying message that might be showing not in words themselves but in the way they are said. A skill which I have to admit that I have not practiced as much as needed is reading. I have not read many books in English and when I have attended English classes I managed to get by simply by listening carefully to what was said in the lectures. I am a very slow reader and that makes reading feel inefficient for me. This might be due to an eye problem, I have been close to getting glasses a few times. The fact that I have not read much has affected my word knowledge, which is not very good. In most books or texts I can understand the meaning without knowing all the words, but sometimes this can lead to big misunderstandings, which I have experienced a few times. I would therefore evaluate my reading as not very good, maybe even poor. As for my writing skills I am, due to me not reading much, not that good a writer neither. I have written very little as far as essays, and I often use spoken English in my writing. In letters and personal notes, this is alright. But when it comes to writing essays and more formal kinds of writing, it is totally unacceptable. This has always been a problem for me, and I have never had a chance to really improve this skill. After all, in most subjects knowing how to write is something you are supposed to have already learnt. My English is not the best. I have some considerable problems with insufficient word knowledge and bad grammar. My writing is in great need of improvement and I have to speed up my reading. On the contrary, my speaking and listening is alright, even though I need a warm up after not having used English in a couple of years. Even though I am aware of my weaknesses I am confident that I can manage to preceed through this course without to much trouble. I might have to spend twenty hours a week on pure reading, but that is the only way I can improve my reading. I will hopefully say in a few months that I am truly competent in English, but as for right now I would say I am "competent with a doubt".$$$﻿ "The only good Indian is a dead Indian." In the nineteenth century, the attitude among the white settlers towards American Indians was that of civilized people looking at savages. Indians were seen as some strange, rather wild savages. Still though, Indians were also admired as stoic and brave. The white settlers moved further and further west, taking over the land of the Indians. The white settlers cheated the Indians many times over and spared no land for them to live in. From giving them the whole western part of America, the white people altered to only allowing the Indians small territories, which by time became smaller and smaller. In this essay I will give an account of the attitudes that allowed for this to happen, as they are revealed in the writings of the white Americans living in the late nineteenth century. In most of the texts written by white Americans at this time, it is quite clear that they did not see Indians as normal humans. They did not even believe them to be at the same level of civilization as white people were. The word they used when they referred to Indians was "savage". They saw Indians as barbaric and impossible to civilize. There was supposedly no way in which white settlers could possibly teach these savages the normal ways of living. The lifestyle that white people demanded must be the only way that could be right. In a text from 1881, Judson E. Walker wrote about the Indians: "Try as they will, they cannot entirely subdue the savage instincts to roam at will, to defy restraint, and to indulge their lawless appetites for blood and plunder." (Walker 67). This was the way in which Indians were normally described at this time, and nobody saw this attitude as strange. Rather it would be strange to believe otherwise. However, there were also Indians who were seen as "good" (Walker 70). These were the ones who accepted the ruling of the white man and plainly let themselves be transported to whatever place the white man designated for them. There they gave up all their old beliefs of moving freely and being a part of nature. Instead they obeyed the laws of the white community. Whites believed, however, that these Indians were not friendly by choice or by nature. On the contrary, these Indians were forced to be friendly because of other reasons. This way of thinking is implied by Elizabeth Custer in her book Boots and Saddles: "Two Bears had long been friendly to the white man; he was too old to fight,..." (Custer 207). Rather than by choice, Two Bears was forced by old age not to fight. The Indians who did fought, however, were seen as horrible warriors. The white thought the fighting spirit and the courage among Indians to be remarkable. Any Indian could bring fear to an ordinary cavalry recruit and this came to be of great importance in the famous battle of Little Big Horn. According to one of the Indian warriors who fought in the battle, nine out of ten soldiers committed suicide during this battle. Presumably, they did this out of fear of the Indian savages whose hatred they were facing. This shows that the white population were not only unknowing about the Indian life. They were also terrified of the way they thought these savages would torture any captured survivors of a battle. Even though the Indians terrified most white people, the white also admired the Indians. In the above mentioned text by Elizabeth Custer, the following passage can be found: "A New York Charity Ball could bring out no more antique heirlooms, nor take more time in preparations than the costumes of Indians prepared for council." (Custer 210). The Indians were responsible for her husbands defeat in Little Big Horn. Still though, Elizabeth Custer did admire the traditions and customs among the Indians. The Indians were also admired as great warriors. The cavalry feared the Indians, but also admired their courage and their offering towards their leaders. When the cavalry arrested and imprisoned Rain-in-the-face, two of the young members in his tribe asked if they could join him in his imprisoning (Custer 213), something that was then seen as extraordinary. Their action showed them to be brave and honourable, something that was common among Indians, but rarely seen among the white settlers. The white also believed the Indians to be concerned as to get revenge. When Rain-in-the-face escaped the white justice, the white thought he would try to get vengeance for the imprisonment. Elizabeth Custer writes about his escape that: "As it will be seen further on, the stained waters of the Little Big Horn, on July 25, 1876, told how deadly and fatal that was." (Custer 215). This is contradicting to the statement of Wooden Leg, who says that none of the Indians who fought in the battle knew they were fighting Custer. Instead they thought they were being attacked by the soldiers they had previously fought on the Rosebud (Graham 106). The white settlers often based their attitudes towards Indians on mistakes like the one above. The attitudes towards Indians have been divided into both fear and admiration. Especially the defeat of General Custer seems to have made an impression on the white Americans. The cavalry saw the Indians as savages and sometimes even as dumb. Although, when they faced the Indians in battle, moreover was defeated, the attitudes changed from malice to almost a kind of respect. The Indians also made great impression as they took their suffering with a kind of toleration. Sitting Bull did not give up for his own sake, but for his people. Sitting Bull, who was the last Indian to surrender (Walker 75), still kept his dignity and he held no hate towards the white man. It was this greatness that created the admiration to the Indians. This admiration was the only white attitude which the American Indians fully deserved.
EE448	1	﻿ Death Penalty - Legalized Murder Death penalty is practised all over the world. Half of the world is still using it as legal punishment. It is mainly used in Asia and in Muslim countries but also in America. There are many reasons why the death penalty should be abolished. There are numerous arguments against the death penalty and it is difficult to point to any single fact or argument as the most important. Below are a number of extremely valid reasons why the practice of capital punishment should be eradicated. Capital punishment does not deter crime. There are several scientific studies that has failed to demonstrate that executions deter people from committing crime. People who commit crimes normally don't expect to get caught and therefore the threat of capital punishment hasn't got any deterrent effect. If someone wants to commit a crime severe enough to result in a death sentence he/she would be most unlikely to regard any consequences of such an act. Courts are unable to prevent accidental execution of innocent people. On several occasions innocent prisoners have been executed. There are countless cases where evidence has come up proving the executed person's innocence. An execution is irrevocable and should absolutely not be carried through unless the evidences are hundred per cent positive. Normally they never are. It has occurred too many times that evidence or some witness has appeared after trial or in worse, after the sentence has been carried out. Executions are sometimes torture. Prisoners who have been executed in the electric chair (in the United States) sometimes didn't die immediately. On some occasions the hair begun to burn or the eyes popped out of their heads. It has happened several times that a prisoner's heartbeat has continued even after the power had been switched off Race plays a role in who gets the death sentence. Death penalty discriminates. If the victim is black or white often plays an important role of whom being charged with capital murder or receiving death penalty. This means that those who murdered whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered blacks. It's also proven that black murderers killing a white person runs a higher risk of being executed than white killers murdering a black person. Among the charged persons receiving a death sentence the majority are poor and they are usually members of an ethnic or religious minority. Executions are very expensive. It is actually more expensive to execute a prisoner than keep him/her imprisoned for life (which normally means 40 years). In Texas for example they can keep three persons in prison for life at the same costs as one execution. The alternatives are preferable. By ending a convict's life the state also eliminates the possibility of getting some important answers. What is it that transforms a man into a killer? How has the convict been affected by his surroundings such as family, neighbourhood, work etc. Maybe the answers would be to uncomfortable. Perhaps they would point at social injustice and racial discrimination? Maybe a long-term psychological investigation in some cases would show that the perpetrator is also a victim. Another argument for imprisonment instead of death is (maybe surprisingly) that it's an easy escape. It's agonizing and maybe painful during a brief moment but then it's all over whereas imprisonment for life under poor conditions with no chance of ever getting out seems far worse. Further, during the time of imprisonment convicts can be taught up as unskilled workers, giving them a chance to repay to society at least a small portion of the damage they've caused. It's my firm conviction that the death penalty is neither a humane nor an effective way of dealing with crime. It seems to me that this cruel punishment is a result of our desire of vengeance rather than to satisfy a need for justice and peace. The death penalty is nothing but an evident confirmation of the old saying "violence begets violence".$$$﻿ My most important piece of furniture The most powerful influences in our communities is television. More people rely on TV than newspapers, radio and the Internet combined. In the following paragraphs I will discuss different ways television affects me and how the different programs make me feel. I will also reflect how it would be like having no TV in my life and speculate what I would do instead of watching television and weigh the pros and cons. I watch films, soap operas and talk shows first, because I love spending hour after hour in front of the television watching programs that in fact give me absolutely nothing but some kind of perverse satisfaction. Talk shows constitute a good example of this where peoples' personal problems make me feel good about myself. I feel good watching all the fat and dumb people in e.g. Ricky Lake and laugh at their problems and silliness. I also like dramas and Spelling-produced series where I can follow the glamorous life of rich and famous people and where I for an hour or two can enter into a world far away from the normal dull working day. However, these programs are plainly entertainment and I get absolutely nothing useful out of them and after switching the TV off I'm neither wiser nor dumber. I'm watching these programs only as a pastime. I have to admit that me watching mentioned programs is nothing I like other people to know. Therefore I only watch them when I'm home alone. When I hear the key in the door and someone is coming home I quickly swap the channel to the news or something else. I can't really explain this, it's just that I feel stupid watching junk. I watch news, documentaries and nature programs next, because in contrast to junk entertainment these programs after watching them, enrich me and make me feel that I learn some important things. Further more I also want to keep up with everything that happens in the world. I think watching TV is a good way of learning different things and get familiar to other cultures and ways of living. Almost everything I know about animals and nature for example comes from nature programs from all over the world. A good way of learning English is by watching TV which is something that can't be underestimated. When Swedes go abroad they often receive compliments for their good knowledge of the English language. Germans don't and the reason is -among others- that all foreign films on German television are dubbed. In Sweden this practice is nonexistent with the exception of some programs for children. Further more old and disabled people use television as a substitute for travelling thus getting a chance to explore the world from their living rooms. It's hard to imagine how my life would be without TV. What I would miss is firstly the news as I prefer watching them on TV rather than reading the news in magazines and newspapers. Pictures stick easier in the memory than text Secondly I would miss an easy way of relaxing and disconnecting my brain. Instead of watching TV I would probably read a book and that's not as relaxing as entertainment on television can be. However I must admit that I sometimes let the television control my life. If I for example follow a TV series, I can't plan anything else the day the series are on. The same thing may be said about films I don't want to miss. TV makes me very asocial. I don't think I would like living without television. Most topics of conversations revolve round things people have seen on TV. However it would benefit my studies having no telly in my house as I easy "need a brake" when I know something's on TV. To cope with all the daily stress and problems I really need to laugh at stupid people in Ricky Lake, dreaming away to the beautiful and rich in the soap operas and be carried away in some action or horror movie. My most important piece of furniture stays where it is.
EE537	0	﻿ English, My English My Relation to English has always been quite special. I have always liked the language and studying it, but still it has always been one of my weakest subjects. Since I started studying English in year three my teachers has always focused on improving our speaking and listening ability, and they haven't put that much effort into our reading and writing skills. That and the fact that I have spent a year in Australian high school has formed my English skills. My strongest side in English has always been speaking. But when I was in primary school and my first year in upper secondary school I had pretty bad self confident and didn't like to use my English. Therefore I decided to go a year to a English speaking country as a exchange student. I ended up in Australia, and why I did that I don't really know I guess the country seemed interesting. When I first came there my self confident probably became even worse, because I realised that the English you learn at school and the English they speak in Australia is totally different. But being in a English speaking country not knowing anybody you had to start speaking, and after a while I started to feel more comfortable whit using my English and I started to understand the Australian accent as well. After my year in Australia I really enjoy using my English, even though I sometimes get a bit harassed because of my accent. It has also showed in my final marks from upper secondary school, where for the first time my English marks didn't put down my average mark. Another strong side has been my listening skill. I think that is since we in Sweden get to hear English on television and cinemas already at an early age. I reckon that it's really good that we use subtitling instead of dubbing here in Sweden because the more you hear English the better your English becomes. Of course my year in Australia has improved my listening ability very much. The first couple of weeks in school it was really hard to stay concentrated for a whole lesson, but as my year went on it got easier and easier to stay focused. After about five months I even started to think and dream in English, and that did listening in English as easy as it is in Swedish. The part that has made English one of my weak subjects is definitely my writing skill. Since my teachers didn't focused very much on writing it didn't really show until we had a test or had to write an essay. I have always found it hard to write essays though, also in Swedish. Actually the only time that I have done good in writing essays was when I where in Australia. I was really surprised how low expectations they put on their students, but I guess that also depends on which school you go to. My school had the lowest average marks in the whole state of New South Wales. So an essay that wouldn't pass in Sweden you could actually get pretty good marks for in my school. I was actually in the top third in English at my school and my teacher told that she was really impressed whit my English skills. I have always found grammar pretty boring, and of course that is one of the reasons why my grammar aren't that good. I thought that my year abroad would help me to improve my grammar, but unfortunately they don't have very good grammar in Australia. And being surrounded by Australians for a year certainly affected my grammar to be more like theirs. To go back my strong sides again. I think that reading is pretty good. I find it quite easy to understand, but I'm not a fast reader. Reading was the part in English that improved the most during my exchange year. Before I went I found it hard read any longer texts, but now I have no problems reading a whole novel, and I really enjoy reading in English now. I really don't have any problems pointing out my weak and strong sides in English. When I went abroad for a year I had hoped to improve my weak sides but didn't really get a chance to do that, and therefore I decided that I would like to study English at a university level and I hope that my weak sides can improve here. And also that my strong sides can become even better.$$$﻿ English my English "I hate English!" This was my spontaneous comment after having English for the first time in fourth grade. Although I was quite excited about school at that time I had a hard time in English-class. Our teacher, Mrs. Buler, loved glossaries and the only thing we did was learning new words and translating them into Swedish. It wasn't until High-School I learned from my English teacher, Mr. Persson, that English is a far more complex language than just words and their Swedish translation. He taught me that English is to listen, read, speak and write. To begin with I would like to state that I am a very good listener. To me listening to English isn't as much listening to an English teacher as it is listening to TV- shows, especially "Crosstalk" at CNN. Most people my age have been brought up with English speaking TV-programs, everything from the shows at BBC to those at MTV. It is because of these television channels English is so integrated in my life since I can pick and choose a certain program of interest. When I go to the movies I often see movies that are romantic therefor I learn a lot of adjectives, mostly concerning people in love. On the other hand since my taste is so narrow when it comes to TV-shows and movies the most of the English I hear outside of school is the English spoken by politicians, newscasters or people deeply in love. This becomes a problem when I try to speak casual English with my American friends. Although, I have to admit, if it wasn't for my friends in America I would never have learned vital words like "yeah man" etc... Being the best way to pick up the written parts of a language, reading is something I do when I have got the time for it. The more you read the better you become at it. If I really like an English novel that I have read in Swedish I often want to read that book in English to see if it is as good or even better in its original language. One of the books that I have read many times, both in its original language and in Swedish, is George Orwells 1984. The problem I face concerning my reading skills is when it comes to concentration, or actually the lack of it. As soon as I loose the slightest of interest in what I am reading I often give up the whole book and do not care to complete it. Another problem I have with reading is that if there's a word I don't understand I look it up in the dictionary instead of trusting the general impression of the story. This becomes a major problem since it keeps me from reading smoothly and therefore I loose interest in the book. Since I lived in America for one year I now have somewhat of a flow in my spoken English. Because it is when you discuss in a certain language your oral skills are put to the test, I enjoy discussing issues in English. I also like Rhetoric and I try to excel at this part of the language, at least that is my goal to do so. After a year in America, speaking becomes the easiest part. When speaking you have to have the vocabulary there in your head to support the message you are giving out to who ever you are speaking with. Sometimes I feel that my vocabulary isn't enough to support my ideas when I speak. The toughest part of the English language is to write correct. The language structure is a part that I also have some problems with. For me it is hard to know if I have made myself perfectly clear or not when I have written something in English. Compared to speaking you do not get the spontaneous reactions of your structure in written language, instead the reactions come when you are done. Therefore it is hard for me to state my weaknesses and strengths when it comes to writing. In conclusion I believe that I am an average student at the English department. I think that I have a firm base to stand on, but I am also aware of that I need to work hard with some parts to become better. As long as I keep my attitude that I want to become better in order to teach others the skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing English.
EE536	0	﻿I went to England this atumn and I went with an idea of being quite familiar with the languge. This showed not to be true as soon as I got there. I had thought that after that term I would be speaking rather fluently with a nice accent, and also understand everything that is said around me. My expectancies on my writing and reading improvements were not as high though. However, I learned a lot of English, but I also learned that English is a very big language and it takes more than a few months and a great effort to master it completely. I find the listeng ability to be the easiest to obtain, since you are exposed to spoken English daily in Sweden. Thanks to subtitling instead of dubbing on TV, musicians writing their lyrics in English and good education in school give most Swedes and Scandinavians a good command of English. Still, I have problems with Irish, Scottish and slang expressions, or any English spoken too quickly or with a strong accent. As I consider my problems with listening depend on the pronounciation it would mean that reading would be easy, as there is no pronounciation to interfere. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be that simple. That is probably because the vocabulary used in written English is much wider than the vocabulary used in speech usually is. Fortunately, there is almost always the possibility to look up unknown words in a dictionary. But I have a weakness when it comes to looking up words, and that is lazyness. When reading a text which is too difficult with too many new words I tend to get bored of looking them up. As a consequence the text becomes incomprehensible, and the result of that is I do not understand it and I lose interest in it. This problem decreases though, as I learn more words. y spoken English is what I am most eagre to improve. In my opinion the speaking part is the most tricky. It seems that the more English I learn, the more difficult it is to speak. That is because I hear my own mistakes as I do them, and I get more and more concious about how I sound, and what impression people might get of me. That is obviously a great disadvantage since it can make me speak less just because of the fear of making mistakes. Also, I have noticed that my English is influenced by who I am talking to. If the person is a native speaker or someone with a good command of the language, I tend to speak better. On the contrary, if the person I am speaking to is on my level or lower, my English seems to get worse. Another aspect is the frustration that is experienced when I lack a word that is essential for what I want to say. Furthermore, I feel limited when it comes to discribing things or explain the meaning of a word. There are several words that I understand when I hear them or read them, but I am not able to use them myself. Of course it is natural to have a bigger passive vocabulary than an active, but still it can be annoying. Another natural thing is the fact that after having spent some time in an English-speaking environment, the language comes much easier. That is good, but the bad thing is that before having spent enough time in such an environment I feel totally incompetent and unable to speak a word. What speaking and writing skills have in common is the importance of grammar, vocabulary and choice of words. Though, it is even more obvious in a written text. There are a lot of things to concentrate on when writing. The content, the storyline, a varied and suited language, and correct grammar. This makes the risk to fail in some area rather big. I have had some experience of writing, but still I feel quite insecure. I have difficulties with the organisation and to keep a clear line through the essay. That includes both essays in Swedish and English. On the other hand, I have noticed that the slightly more formal language used in written but not as frequently in spoken English comes easier. To conclude, my weaknesses and strengths are quite equally spread over the four areas that are concerned here. At this point I feel that I am half the way where I want to be.$$$﻿Introduction In the following essay I'm going to tell you a little about my English skills. I'm going to point out my strengths and weaknesses in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. Listening: I have studied English in school since I was about ten years old. My listening to English probably started long before that though. I think so because I remember how my older brother always watched TV that I couldn't understand. I also have two cousins from England who came for a visit many years ago. I never dared say a word to them. Anyway, I believe it was good for me to get in touch of English as early in my life as I did. Because now I don't have any problems understanding English. Of course I have to really strain myself sometimes when a person talks very fast or have got an accent I'm not familiar with. All in all I really think I'm competent when it comes to listening to English. It's without a doubt my best side about the English language. Reading I enjoy reading English litterature. Sometimes I can feel that the Swedish language is very boring and then I usually find an English fiction book to relax by. Of course I find it easier to read a Swedish book, but I like reading books in their original language, and I guess most authors are American or English. My big weakness in this area is that the first minutes of my reading a book or something, I look up the words I don't recognize and I write them down. After a few minutes though, I get tired of interruppting my reading and I stop to look up words. I'm working on getting more patient in this area. This was all about fiction books, which I made clear that I like. When it comes to reading facts about something like America's government - thats what we are doing in social studies now, I'm not very enthustiatic. In those kinds of texts there are often words used that you don't see every day. And I already explained how I feel about looking up words. I still wouldn't say my reading is bad in this area, I'm just not very fond of that kind of reading. Speaking I can speak pretty good and fluent English, I think. When I go to another country I usually need a day or two to feel confident enough to speak when I don't have to. I don't really know if I have a good accent or not. So I'm looking forward to the speaking part this term. Then we have the part that makes me uncertain of myself; grammar. It's like I don't have time to think about grammar when I talk so I don't know what grammar mistakes I make, and they are probably quite many. I have always been thinking that I would hear if I said something grammatically wrong, and so I havent really bothered to learn the grammar rules. Now I understand that I will have to learn them. Writing Writing is what I don't like about English. I know exactly what I want to write but most often it doesn't go my way. I have troubles finding the right words, which makes me repeat myself. And very often as soon as I have written a sentence I erase it because it sounds wrong or simply looks wrong. In other words I really need writing practise. I never had much opportunities to practise writing in school, although I had a lot of spelling practise. So atleast now I feel pretty confident in spelling. Conclusion I would say that my English is good enough to get by on in a foreign country. However it's not good enough to teach from. What I need to study most is grammar and writing and then I think I can get by quite good. I think I have a lot of work to look forward to this term, but also a lot of fun.
EE535	0	﻿ English, My English! Writing an essay about my relation to the English language and about how competent I feel about it at this point seemed like a very easy task at first, but now that I think about it the answer to these questions isn't that obvious. Why is that? I think probably it's because of the fact that this isn't something you ever think about having to evaluate. You hardly ever think about what your native language means to you, so when it comes to English it's even more difficult to find a good answer. I guess you'll just have to go back in time and think about your experiences of English. But one can already establish the fact that our native language is a necessity and that in the world today this isn't always enough. It's getting more and more important to master the English language aswell. Because whatever you do and wherever you go you find English. This language is universal and you need it whatever field you're in. In Sweden one has understood the importance of a good knowledge of English. You start studying it already at the age of nine in swedish schools. I've always loved to travel and to get to know people from all over the world. I guess that's why I chose to study a lot of languages in upper secondary school. English was compulsory of course. But I also chose to study Latin, French, Spanish and Italian. Of all these languages I prefered French, so that's what I've continued to study here at Uppsala University and in France. I think that I master French really well at this point and it feels a bit strange to say that I speak French better than I speak English. But that's simply the truth today. Anyhow, from now on I'll concentrate on English for a few years and hopefully after this my mastery of English will be as good as my mastery of French, or even better. When I was fourteen years old my family had an excange student from the United States staying with us for three months. This was without any hesitation a very good opportunity for both me and my younger brothers to come in contact with the English language. Her name is Leah and we became best friends. We've been corresponding ever since and in fact we met in France last spring. As I said, getting to know this girl helpted me to get in contact with English, but it also made me realize how wonderful and enriching it is to master a foreign language. After finishing secondary school I went to England on a three-weeks language course. I hardly learned anything at all, but I guess I matured a bit anyway. In upper secondary school I participated in all kinds of exchange programs just to get the opportunity to travel and to meet students from other countries. I went to Denmark, Poland, Czech Republic and Switzerland, and I received students from the respective countries in my home in Suderhamn. With all these people I spoke English, but I don't know if it always ameliorated my own English. I mean, speaking English with somebody from Poland for instance is not like talking with somebody whos native language is really English. When I hear English on the radio, on TV or when I'm talking to somebody in English I feel that I can understand almost everything of what is said. I guess that an advantage in Sweden is that everything on TV for example always is in English and never dubed like in certain other countries. I think that reading isn't a problem for me either. As I said earlier, I've studied Latin and I feel that this often helps me to recognize word-stems and above all to know the meaning of prefixes and suffixes in certain words. My weaknesses in English at this point are speaking and writing. I think that has to do with the fact that I've been studying French and other Romance languages aswell for such a long time. I feel that I've got problems with pronunciation and spelling. When it comes to listening and reading it's an advantage for me if the words resemble the words in French. But when it comes to pronunciation and spelling it's rather a disadvantage. Hopefully all this will be much easier later on.$$$﻿y English education started early, as it does for most Swedes now days. Listening to music, watching American TV-shows.... I already knew a lot of English when the formal education kicked in. At that time it was when you were in forth grade, about 10 years old. Today they start earlier, which shows the importance of the English language in the Swedish society. As I've been listening to American English (I might point out) all my life, listening to English isn't a problem. I understand perfectly. I don't have a problem with dialects either in American English, but in British English it is harder when it comes to that. Watching the Scottish movie "Trainspotting" without any translation was quite hard. My British friend who were with me at the time had a hard time too actually. I don't always understand slang words in British, but I do in American English. I guess that comes from watching American sit-comes way to much. The way I learnt American has to do with my love for music. As soon as I could speak I started to sing along to songs on the radio and moms Abba-records. Even when the songs were in English and I had no idea what I was singing. That is where I got the "rhythm" of the language. When I was around five years old my biggest idols were Culture club (British English) and David Bowie (also British English). But after the age of seven (when the memory center in the brain starts to function properly) the idols was mostly from USA and Canada. I loved Bruce Springsteen, how much more American can it get? I've always loved to read. But most of my reading I've done in Swedish. When I entered Uppsala University as an anthropology student it changed. Basically all the literature was in English and even some lectures. I found it hard in the beginning, but it got easier and easier. Now I prefer to read fiction in English too. I think that a story is best told in the language of the writer (no offense to all the very talented translators). Two weeks ago I read "animal farm" by George Orwell (which was great by the way), and I think it would have lost some of the books funnier points if it had been in Swedish. That definitely goes for comedy. I remember when those insensitive bosses at TV 3 tried to change the language of the Simpson's family, from American English to Swedish! What a joke! People complained so much that they had to change it back. I don't think (and hope) they will try a stunt like that again. I don't want to have it like in Germany. Imagine "Seinfeld" in Swedish? Don't think so. I would stop watching the show (even though, as I've indicated before, that American sit-comes is a favorite of mine..). To speak American English isn't a problem. After I graduated from the gymnasium I went straight to the States to live there for a year. I was an au pair in an American family. I HAD TO speak American all day long, because of the kids. The kids were spoiled and behaved badly as kids tend to do sometimes, but they never said anything about that they didn't understand what I said or made fun of my accent. That helped me to naturally glide into the language. I taught them a lot, but they also taught me. After the first month we got along fine and I loved spending time with them. Playing with kids is an unusual fun way to learn a language better. The only problem I had with pronunciation was with the English "j". One of the little girls I was taking care of in Maryland was named "Julia", and I kept on saying "Julia" the Swedish way and she kept on reminding me of the American way "Ddddjulia". Writing English has always been my weak point. I spell badly and my grammar is awful. That's why I signed up for the English course here at Uppsala University. I have no idea WHY I say this and not that. I just chat. When you pressure me with two sentences and ask which one is the grammatical correct one, it is a big chance that I'm not gonna be able to tell you. That is all I have to say about me and the English language! Cheers!
EE333	0	﻿ Why has the level of alcohol taking increased so much in the Spanish teenagers? Alcohol taking in Spain is on a considerable increase as regards those who are under age in our society. The present situation has become almost untenable and now the time has come to do something as both the Spanish government and the media indicate continuously. However, this is not a problem originated just a moment ago, but we should find its stems in the basis of our own Spanish society. We have not realized yet what was happening very close to us. Now that the level of alcohol taking is without any doubt alarming, it would be reasonable to pick out some possible causes for this problem. The media have suggested several causes and among them, one stands out against the rest: the government, they say, does not control neither pubs nor bars where they go on selling alcohol to the under-aged. The latter really find it easy to have a drink or two or even to get drunk for the first time in their lives. The owners of those places only look after their own interests and above all, they look after their economy. They would probably complain that they do not win enough money to pay everything they must pay as they are fully endowed with taxes. This is what many journalists in Spain have upheld in their articles. Another reason that the media in Spain have also revealed as possible and that has been this time corroborated by those children' s parents is that of the more than probable unconcern the latter have with regard to their children's education, habits and manners. Many of the problems originated at home create certain confusions in the mentality of the affected ones, who really feel demoralized and find a refuge in the end. This refuge is obviously alcohol. Those parents do not realize that they have caused the problem beforehand and very often, ironically, they quit from their own blames and even say that they find it almost impossible to have their children under control all the time. The reason, they say, is that you can never know what your child is doing outside home and thus, whatever moment you can say: "He' s done me!" Still many sociologists indicate that it is about time to raise the conscience of the parents for a greater control of their children. However, the main cause for this increase is, from my point of view, the desire to imitate, the desire to have a new experience (the first drunkenness), because they can see it everywhere and would like to feel as the grown-ups do. They want to feel superior to the rest of the people and thus, not being limited any more. This remarkable desire for freedom is due to: the presence of a society completely based on alcohol, the development of advertising campaigns concerning alcohol and again, the little consideration of the family towards their children. First, just investigating in the past times of the Spanish society, we can find that it has always been eminently related to alcohol. Spain has always tended to have people who really like to have a good wine or a beer in a pub all nights or even our past banquets were full of wine and some other drinks. If we asked our parents what did they usually do when they were young, if they did the same or not, they would probably answer like this: "Ok, Yes but not so young as it happens now. In fact, we were more innocent people." Below this historic assumption, well -known by the tourists and foreigners in Spain, that urge for imitation and superiority is very well hidden in it. Secondly, the development of advertising campaigns on the TV which include alcohol in their sales, contribute to strengthen this problem even more. As many sociologists say, when that child sits on the sofa and watches the ads on the TV, that desire for knowing the taste of what has just been shown on the TV is really created in him. Perhaps, he has already seen his parents do that before. As a result of this, everything goes back again to that idea of the unconcern of the parents who do not know how to give their children a good education and bring it to a successful conclusion. A few solutions are of course needed, but now it is not the time to look for them. Maybe some special campaigns too should be done to help those parents! In conclusion, as we have seen, there is an enormous increase in the number of the under-aged people in Spain drinking too much alcohol. It is a present problem without any sort of solution ahead, but a full study of this causes and, of course, a little bit of common sense will do the rest.$$$﻿ Obesity- a New Endemic Decease? In the last thirty years Miss Sweden has grown four centimetres and lost fifteen kilos. At the same time, the average person has gained weight, a lot of weight. Half a million Swedes are suffering from severe overweight (Rossner1999)and WHO has defined obesity as a global epidemic and says that this is just the beginning of the problem (Greider1999). Children get medical problems that only used to strike adults and even though they are overweight, many children suffer from malnutrition. What are the reasons behind this new endemic decease? In recent years, genetic explanations have become popular for explaining all sorts of things, such as alcoholism and crimes. There is a belief that biology can explain anything. Perhaps, obesity can be explained in this way. Genes do affect a person's weight but they cannot explain the quick increase of obesity during the last decades. We have to look for answers in other areas. Could it be a reaction to the high pressure from society? We live in a world were beauty and fitness are desirable features. Different kinds of eating disorders have increased the last decade and perhaps obesity is another way of reacting to the same thing. The ideals are too high, we know that we cannot reach them so we give up and let ourselves go. Still, this cannot be the case for all the millions of people, all over the world, suffering from obesity. According to WHO obesity is an effect of the modernisation of our society. New inventions and technological improvements make it possible to achieve the same things as before with less physical effort. We move less, both in our work and in our everyday life. Modern society offers us a set of easy solutions: lifts, cars escalators and an endless variety of electric gadgets. All these little things put together increase our inactivity and, in the long run, make us fatter. Even children and young people are getting idler. The majority exercise a great deal but the group that does nothing at all is increasing in number. Young people sit in front of the telly, watching or playing games, instead of being outside, moving around in real life games. In addition to a more sedentary life, our modern society has provided us with a new kind of food. Food that is cheap, fast and easy to cook, but with low nutritive value. In many families, both parents work long hours and consequently there is no time to sit down together and eat properly prepared meals in the evenings. Fast food and sandwiches have replaced home cooking. It has become more important to get food on the table as fast as possible than to make it a nourishing and healthy meal. Furthermore, the lack of home cooking has decreased the awareness about food value, especially amongst young people. The lack of awareness about, and attitudes towards, food and exercise is a big part of the problem. This has been shown in study made at the University of Gothenburg (Oppenheim2000). The study also shows that there is a connection between social belonging and obesity. Children from social group one have a greater awareness about what they eat and exercise more than children from lower social groups do. As a result, they have fewer problems with their weight. In resent years unemployment and poverty have increased, at the same time cut downs have been made on health and sports lessons in schools. This could explain the increasing obesity especially amongst children, since we know that habits primarily are created within the families or schools. If you get used to junk food and sedentary games as a child, it is much harder changing this lifestyle later in life. Furthermore, food with a high value of energy but a low nutritive value is often cheap while many forms of exercising are quite expensive. If you don't have very much money, your priorities might be on other things. odern society with its new inventions and technological solutions has made our lives easier but at the same time made us more passive. We can no longer count on getting enough exercise trough our every day life. We need to be aware of what we eat and how we should exercise. If we have this awareness, we can make our own choices about our health. Although the reasons lay in society the solution lays with the individual. Only you can change your way of life.
EE517	0	﻿ English, My English! As an opening I would like to say; have patience! I must say that you challenge one of my greater weaknessess immediately By saying write an essay on 700 words. I have close to never written essays, and when I have, it always tend to be shorter than it is supposed to be. I guess that I have a lack of fantasy, but on the other hand it is easy for me to let the imagination run away with me. Maybe that is because I have never heard the words coherence and cohesion before. That means that I often starts to write about irrelevant things. But I actually prefer to keep it a little bit shorter instead of going on and on about the same thing just to reach 700 words etc. Even though it is hard for me to write long essays, I find this an excellent way for me to express myself considering that I'm very shy. Another thing about writing is that I often make grammatical errors, but thanks to my relatively well-functioning ear for languages I sometimes manage to get things right! I am also pretty good at spelling. Concerning listening, I am able to concentrate on the lecturer and on what he or she has to say. I have the ability to take in a lot of information and I also have a good memory. Sometimes, when I get tired after three or four Lectures, then I have the "skill" to look very awake and interested even if I'm not! Though it doesn't help me in any way, it gives an good impression! My weakness is that I can not take notes at the same time. I can not decide what things to write down and what not to write. I just can't listen at the same time as I'm writing. And when I get home and I read my notes, well, it would be more correct to say that I try to read them, then it is impossible to understand them! So that is something that I really have to practise. One of my interests is to read books. Unfortunately, lack of time has been the mainreason that I haven't read that many the last couple of months. But when I look at the literature schedule it seems like I must find the time. Even thougt interest is not a skill, I have to say that I list that as my number one skill when it comes to reading. Without my interest I think that I wouldn't get very far. You must be motivated if you are going to go through all these books. I haven't read that many English books and I hope that this reading course will help me to increase my vocabulary. I always keep a dictionary near at hand. y weakness is that I occasionally have difficulties to understand how to pronounce the written word. Sometimes, when it is a seldom used word, it would be good for me to both see and hear the word. And, finally, speaking: I have never used my English on a day-to-day basis. I have never been to England or the States, or anywhere abroad for a longer period of time. The only English I have spoken is the poor English I was thought in upper secondary school. That makes me a little bit, not incapable, but insecure. As I mentioned before I'm pretty shy and I prefer to work in smaller Groups when it comes to speaking. I think that this is a question of self confidence and to have the guts. Once I have crossed that line I don't think that this will be a problem. Another weakness is that I tend to mix British accent and American accent. I had a British English teacher during comprehensive school and an American during upper secondary school. I think that this may have affected me. I know that I have to choose an accent, but I don't know which one! But I think that it will come naturally after a while.$$$﻿ English, My English To assess one's ability of English is not an easy task. I will, however, try in this essay. The focus will be on the four areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing, these four being the essential core of language proficiency. If you master these you will be a very competent speaker of English. They are of course all over lapping each other. Although there are other things such as register, body language and so forth they will not be emphasised here. I will start with the listening part. There isn't very much to this in my opinion. All you can do is to listen when people speak English and try to be active. Which is to say that you should not just listen but also consciously memorise what you hear and ponder it. How good a listener am I then? Well, I can follow English speaking programs on television without need of the subtitles that being one criterion. Entering here is the issue of registers. I easily understand the language of say soap operas which is very constructed and for that matter not always very natural. When it comes to news broadcasts and debate shows for example some problems might arise. In these types of programs the language is often more academic and therefor not as easy to completely understand. On the other hand I am quite good at guessing the meaning of words I don't know out of the context. As for the 'opposite' of listening, speaking, I can only say that this is the part of my English that I tend to overrate the most. This, I would think, is because when I'm thinking in English it all sounds so perfect in my head. It's at the moment when I have to utter these thoughts that my short comings are exposed to the world. It seems at times as though my facial muscles have not been properly tuned for English. This has the effect that when I'm not speaking English on a regular basis I think to high of my self and once I start talking I feel sort of disappointed with my self. y accent of English is to a great extent influenced mainly by American television (something which we have extremely much of in this country). As mentioned above the language of tv is not always that natural. Not to mention movie language which is often very foul and gives many people the idea that this is the way English is. If you're unfortunate then you may get a lot of bad habits by watching the 'wrong' things on tv. The medium is, at the other end of things, an endless source of opportunities to practise both listening and speaking skills. I've come to discover that in to order to speak fluently you have to, in a way, disconnect your linguistic monitor, put it to sleep if you will, because if you're always wondering if what you're saying is correct it will hinder the fluency of your speech. So much for the spoken English. The two remaining main parts of this essay of course constitutes the written English. These are easier to work with, compared to spoken English, because when you're reading or writing you have time to correct your self and look up translations in a dictionary and so on. I would consider my own reading ability to be very good. I read a lot of books in English and also quite frequently magazines like Time. In the past year, due to, university studies, I've been forced into reading non-fiction literature. A thing that not only made me more familiar with these kinds of texts that are of a truly different type than novels, almost by definition harder to penetrate, but at the same time they widened my vocabulary in a very useful way. Finally writing. This part of the language is getting more and more easy as word processors are getting more and more clever. In the old days when essays were written on paper you had to be very careful with the spelling. Now that computers take care of that for you and immediately tell you when you misspelled something you can concentrate your energy on the more important thing namely the content of the essay. y writing has been affected in yet another way by all these spell checks. Errors that used to be very common in my texts are now almost non-existent due to the fact that my computer was constantly nagging me about them. Eventually I learned. A conclusion of this essay then might be to say that although by no means fully learned I have the necessary knowledge to, if not pass this course, at least live in an English speaking country.
EE334	0	﻿This essay is about me, or more correctly; about my level of proficiency in the various aspects of the English language. I will try to assess my different strengths and weaknesses and convey them to you, the reader, in a manner as objective and sincere as I can. It is not easy, being completely objective, though. To give some perspective to my own qualities I have also chosen to elaborate, in some sections, on the general process of learning English itself. I will try not to be too cumbersome. I have no real difficulties understanding spoken English, especially not when I can see the person speaking, and definitely not when I am standing in front of him or her (as opposed to seeing said person on a screen). Speaking over the phone is more difficult. The quality of sound is poor compared to other mediums, and you have no eye contact. I should tell you that I am talking about the more common dialects of English, such as the American, Brittish, Australian, etc. I, as many others, may have some problems understanding people with very strong, or different, accents. You can usually comprehend what they say, but must pay more attention in order to do so. A friend of mine, for example, tried having a conversation with a drunken old Scottsman once, and wasn't able to recognize one single word (it has to be said that the situation was extreme, though, and that he had no problems understanding the rest of the population). Happily for us Swedes we are constantly bombarded with different kinds of English via TV and films, although primarily American and Brittish English (lots of variants in there, though). It does train us, but we do tend to have more difficulty without the subtitles. I, too, have this weakness, although I tend to have problems only when the sounds of speech is more difficult to make out, like in a gunfight, or someone whispering softly, etc. But it could be argued that when you don't get the full spectrum of sound your ability to understand speech in general decreases, and non-native speakers are the first ones to notice simply due to their lesser proficiency in the language. I have no problem in understanding written text other than odd expressions or odd words (I usually see to it that I have access to a glossary when reading, since I hate not understanding everything). I have read a lot of books in English, both fiction and non-fiction (mostly Computer Science-related). I also read quite a lot of articles concering different aspects of programming and Computer Science in general, thus having a pretty good understanding of the terms related to this field. All in all, I have to say that I am quite good at reading and understanding texts of various kinds. I also think I am quite a good speaker. I tend to be pretty fluent, especially when talking to native speakers. I usually adapt somewhat to their style of talking and pronouncing, often without really thinking about it. One time at work comes to mind, when I came across an American, newly moved to Sweden. We started talking (I was actually supposed to show him a computer system) and although I felt kind of rusty and slow the first couple of minutes I later felt rather comfortable. In about five minutes I had adapted to a more American pronounciation (he was from NY, I think) than my normal one (a mixture somewhere between the hopelessly American and a rather relaxed Brittish English), and he even complemented me on this and said that I had lost my accent almost entirely over the time we spoke (around 45 minutes). Here we also have the TV and film influence. Not having series and films dubbed to Swedish gives us the opportunity, wether we want it or not, to absorb the expressions and ways of the native speakers (although one might be slightly unsettled thinking about the influence of shows like "the Simpsons" if you are a follower of this theory). I sincerely believe that this is one of the main reasons for the poor mastery of English by some nationalities (not "the Simpsons", rather their dubbing of films and TV shows instead of using subtitles). I normaly don't write very much in English, but I think that my extensive reading of varied English literature has given me an eye, or a feeling if you like, for what is correct and what is not. I do prefer free writing (i.e. short stories), instead of the more strict layout of essays and such. There are always at least two aspects of writing though. The technical, or grammatical, part and the more creative part of actually composing something interesting to read. I am actually quite lousy at the details of grammar (terms and their ilk) and normally go on what feels and looks right as would a native speaker (and many Swedes do use this "technique", with various success). This does not always work, of course, but the constant exposure to this language helps a lot. I suspect that my grammar skills will increase greatly (at least on the terminology side) during my English studies at Uppsala University. ost of my writing has actually been rather informal, like e-mails and such, primarily to English colleagues at my work. On a side note concerning e-mails; I fondly remember one I wrote a couple of years ago to an esteemed techical writer called Michael Abrash (famous for his books and articles on computer graphics programming and optimization) and the very long and detailed answer I received from him. Being able to communicate with people you admire is a wonderful thing, and I have my competence in the English language to thank for that (this not meaning that there are no Swedish people I admire, mind you).$$$﻿ EVALUATION I will in this essay try to assess my knowledge in the English language in the fields of listening, reading, speaking and writing. I will try to evaluate what I consider beeing my strong and weak sides in these areas. Listening to English: I have, ever since I was a kid, been very interested in rockmusic and not only listening to the actual music, but also trying to listen to and understand the meaning of the lyrics. Since almost all contemporary rockmusic is sung in the English language I'm quite used to hearing it and can easily understand it. I have also many times tried to learn lyrics that I find especially good or interesting by listening to the song in head phones and trying to figure out the words, sometimes rewinding the tape over and over again at a particularly difficult word or phrase, and write it down on paper. I also very much enjoy watching films and have, also since I was a kid, more or less been forced to watch English-spoken films with no subtitles simply because they have not been relaesed in Sweden and there was no subtitles avilable. To sum things up; I'm used to listen to English being spoken, or sung, and I have acctually no problems with it, if there is a word I don't understand I can more or less figure it out by the context. Reading in English: Well, it's basically the same deal here... Due to my huge interest in music I started very early to read various British and American music periodicals dealing with heavy metal and punk music, basically because back then (the mid-eighties) there was no such magazines available in Swedish. If you wanted to learn more about your favorite bands you had to try and spell your way through English-written litterature. I can say now in retrospective that it was very useful to stumble through these magazines since I now can read English pretty fluent. The only bad thing about that is that I sometimes becomes a little over-confident in my skill of mastering the vocabulary. I seldom take the time to actually look up a in a dictionary a word I may not grasp. Speaking English: I'm afraid I'm not as good at speaking English as I am at reading and understand/listen to it. I don't speak that much English in my every-day situation, sometimes I have to answer a phone-interwiev for my bands, talking to people at our record companies (based in France and Germany) and so on. I don't feel uncomfortable speaking English with another person that has English as a second language since I, in my humble opinion, speak more than well enough to make myself understood, but when I speak to a "native" I somehow feel uneasy, I get a feeling of "inferiority", so to speak. I do sometimes have a problem with finding the proper words or terms right away and I'm also a bit uncertain with word order in sentences and this becomes more evident when I'm speaking with someone that has English as their mother tounge. Writing in English: This part is what I feel is the most difficult. When I'm writing a longer piece in English, like this essay, it is with difficulties. As I mentioned earlier I sometimes have problems with using the correct words so the use of a dictionary is more or less a must. Also my problems with word order, correct grammar, punctuation, and most of all, spelling becomes almost embarrassingly evident. I write all the lyrics for my band "The Unkinds" in English and I think it's very fun to write in English for a change, it's a very useful and suitable language for rock lyrics with all the "cool" words. I have gotten a lot of aclaim for my lyrics in various underground music magazines from all around Europe but I think they would have been less favourable if our American bassplayer hadn't went over them before recording and corrected my spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Hopefully I can improve my writing skills by writing essays like this one. I think this is just about everything I can tell about my competence in these fields. Some things I feel I master pretty well, other things I'm not so certain of and they need some more practice. It's been quite interesting to evaluate these topics and I have tried to be as honest to myself as I possibly could when writing this.
EE380	0	﻿ Why take the boat when you can fly? Ever since the human being discovered that you could travel to foreign countries by boat, the means of transport have been improved. The demand for fast transports has however increased. After some time you wanted to fly. You wanted to be free as a bird. The human being took the challenge to built airplanes and made it. The first ones were fairly slow and uncomfortable. By time has however the airplane's rapidity increased and the service to the passengers has been considerably improved. Today we live in a very stressed world and time has been much more important today in our society, then it perhaps was in former times. The current expression "Time is money" explains a great deal how we live today. To mention the medical treatment in the world the airplanes had had a positive influence. If it's an earthquake somewhere in the world doctors, medication and dogs can arrive very quickly to help. Many more people can be rescued thanks to the doctors' achievement at place. Another example is the transports of sick persons. People that have injured themselves abroad and have to come home fast for operation can do so if they can go by airplane. The same is for organtransports. These have to be transported incredibly fast so they still working when it arrives to the persons that are in great need of them. One negative thing about the airplanes is that the environment takes a lot of damage from the airplanes. This is something that should, even if it's hard, be improved. I don't know how but it should work, some how. At the same time the industrial boats leak out incredibly much oil in the world's oceans today and nothing good comes out of that either. Every ocean stops living, like the Mediterranean Sea already has. The world's environmentproblems got to stop! If you are a businessman with the whole world as your office you got to be effective. You have to make sure you get some contracts signed from different people all over the world, and to get those contracts signed you have to arrive to the different people and places pretty fast so they don't change their mind before you get there. You also have to come home to your company pretty fast so you keep the company's production rolling. You can't do this if you travel by boat. The boat is way too slow. A transport should go pretty fast. Especially if it's for example expensive goods that are transported to private persons. It won't do that by boat. Transports to electric companies that must have small electric products (ordering products) etc. has to be delivered to the company/ fabric quite fast so it wont stop in it's production. If that is the case people maybe loose their work just because the products hasn't been delivered in time. Fast transports are essential. By air the world's areas are shrinking and you have the possibility to have the kind of works that I have recently described, without the familysituation should be affected too much. The world's tourism has increased year after year. More and more people fly further and further away. Today you can travel to Australia by air at the same time what it takes to England by boat. Today you can travel by air over Europe and if you are headed to, for example, Greece you arrive at the same day. That's impossible by boat. This way you get a longer holiday. Now, some people say that they have their vacation at the boat. That's of course one way of spending your vacation but if you want a longer vacation abroad in a foreign country the airplane is the definitive solution!$$$﻿ EVALUATION English, My English I have been studying English since fifth grade. I listen to English music every day, and almost every movie I watch is from Australia, the United States or the United Kingdom. So why can't I learn how to speak English properly? y accent is definitely my most significant weakness. I have more weaknesses when it comes to the English language, but I'm better at hiding the others. But sometimes I have to speak, and every time I sound terrible. I sound so Swedish. I haven't always been aware of my bad accent. None of my classmates in compulsory school could really speak English, and neither could I. But I was more interested in learning English then they were, so I felt pretty smart. But that changed. What was it then that made me realize I sounded like a lousy acter? I know exactly when I realized it and who the person was that told me. It was in upper secondary school. A boy in my class had written a poem in my calender. The first sentence was: " Holy Mother Earth". I liked the poem very much, so I read it to a friend in another class. Then a boy in her class started teasing me for the way I pronunced the first sentence. That was the first time I even thought about how I sounded. But since that day I have been trying to improve my pronunciation. I can't say I've succeeded. But I still try. It's much easier when it comes to reading. If I don't understand the meaning of a word, I always look it up. I think it's fun to learn new words, it doesn't matter in what language. I reacon I'll have use for them some day. I've never had any problems with reading. I read very fast, but I have to be concentrated. Otherwise I don't remember what I've read. But nothing bothers me if I read something interesting. (English or Swedish.) My mother had to deal with that many times. I just don't care about anything but what I'm reading. I don't even notice if the text is English or Swedish if the content is interesting. I guess that's proves that I'm used to the English language. If a text is difficult, I can't concentrate, I want to know the meaning of every single word. I can't just go on. What if the word is really important? I must learn the meaning of it! My vocabulary has increased a lot thanks to this. I've realized the best way to try to understand a word is to pronunce it to myself. Then I often recognize it. But it takes a lot more time for me to read an English text compared to a Swedish one, because I use the dictionary very often. What about spoken English then? Do I have any problems with that? I have never really thought about how I listen to English. I'm so used to it. I hear English most of the time. If it's not the music on the radio, it's the TV. If I just listen, it's the same as with reading something interesting. I don't recognize which language I'm listening to. After some of the lectures here at the University, I have to think" Did he/she really speak English.?" English is a part of the every-day life. For me, listening to English is no longer more difficult then listening to Swedish. But I have to admit I've had some trouble in the Grammar lectures. So many new words, and when I look them up, the Swedish translations are just as unknown to me as the English words. Except from that I need to concentrate more to understand all turns and jokes in English. It's easy to lose the thread if somebody changes the subject often. That is a problem I've never experienced when I listen to Swedish. y difficulties with the English language can be solved nearly every time if I concentrate. I know the basics, and I learn something new every day. I wrote that reading has never been a problem for me. Neither has writing. I've written short stories in Swedish since I was a child, and I like to write. I have a great imagination, well trained when I was a child.( = I made up rather unbelievable things.) I remember that I thought writing in English was difficult when I started upper secondary school. Probably because I didn't have the vocabulary I needed. But I had a great teacher that thought me very much, and she made us write a lot of summaries and essays. The best way to learn something is to practise, so I can't say I think writing is difficult anymore. There was one thing my teacher complained about. (Of cource I did more errors, but this always came up.) I often avoid difficult words. If I'm not certain of the spelling, and haven't got a dictionary, I prefer to exchange the word rather then to try spelling it. Maybe because I've never have had any problem what so ever with spelling Swedish. If I spell a word wrong, I feel stupid. It feels like I've been trying to show off with words I don't really know. There are some words I always spell the wrong way. I always throw in an "e" too much in "being", I just can't remember not to do it. I have problems with writing short things. And I don't keep to the subject. But I guess I can't blame English for that... My weaknesses are not unusual, just the problems that occur when one deals with a foreign language. But I admit I could kill for a better English accent...
EE532	0	﻿ Reflections on TV-violence In this essay I'm going to discuss the influence TV-violence has on teenagers and the way we look at violence in general. I will focus on the teenagers since they are most likely to absorb the messages sent out by television. I will also discuss whether it is only TV-violence that has influence on teenagers behaviour or if other factors also should be considered as important in this issue. I will also provide you with some information about the history of violence as a form of entertainment Violence has been part of entertainment since the days of the Roman Empire, when gladiators fought against each other and wild animals. In the "cowboy era" it was very popular to watch the hangings of criminals. Public executions are viewed to the public even today, which I think is wrong. First, because it's unnecessary violent pictures for young people to see. Second of all, because it is wrong of a state to murder if an individual isn't allowed to take other peoples lives either. Another example is boxing, which has been, and is still, a very violent sport, which involves blood, pain and broken jaws. However, these events are somewhat pale compared with today's horrible and bloody televised pictures, which brings me to my next subject, news-broadcasts. The news-broadcasts has made teenagers, and adults as well, almost numb to violence, in the sense that they don't take it as seriously as they should when they see pictures of dead children, starving people or war-victims. There are no happy endings in news-broadcasts, but we get used to that as well. One day we woke up and found ourselves in a vicious circle, the more violence we were shown, the more immunity we developed towards it. I say these words out of own experience, because this is how I feel it has become. I believe that technology bears no little responsibility to the way we have ended up looking at violence. Since the equipment has become smaller, more modern and easier to use, it makes it easier for journalists to take more realistic and thus, more horrifying pictures. For example, nowadays journalists are invited to the frontlines of war in order to make that specific side look like the better one. I don't suggest that bloody news-broadcasts should be banished from TV since I believe that there are more important factors that reflects teenagers behaviour. There is no doubt that teenagers are influenced by the violence they see on TV, this has negative effects on their concentration in school and the need to use violence in real life. But the question is. How do we know how much TV-violence that influences teenagers, and how much other factor influences them? Chances that an aggressive teenager has other social problems are pretty good. Maybe he/she was beaten or sexually abused during his/her childhood. Maybe his/her parents were alcoholics and he/she didn't get enough love. I think these social problems is far greater reason for teenagers to use violence to express themselves than all TV-violence in the world combined. I don't think that all teenagers growing up with some kind of social problem turn into an aggressive individual, it depends not so much on genes but more on the area that the child grew up in. I remember one specific example from school that illustrates this pretty well; it was when I studied Biology that I learned of this example that I'm going to tell you about. The example was about two twins, one (Sara) who grew up in a "safe" area with loving and caring parents. The other one (Emma) who grew up in the suburbs of a big city with one parent who was an alcoholic. Sara made a carrier in a respected law-firm and gave birth to two healthy kids. Emma had a more troublesome childhood with a criminal record longer than route 666, at one occasion she had beaten up a police officer. And by the age of 22 she committed suicide under the influence of some kind of heavy drug. How much TV they watched wasn't revealed to me by the teacher who told the story. This example proves that social background is a very important factor for teenagers' behaviour. I've come to the conclusion that violence and aggression among teenagers depend not so much on television but rather on their social background. And after all we always have the ability to turn our television of and read a good book instead. It's harder to choose where and with whom you want to grow up.$$$﻿ Swedish benefits from a membership in EMU. On the 24th of June 1994 Sweden signed a contract with the European Union, EU, which stated that Sweden would join the union on January 1 1995. This contract also means that Sweden is obligated to follow the different conventions that are part of the union. One of these conventions, called the Maastricht Convention, includes a project called EMU, European Monetary Union, which is an economic collaboration with the final purpose of introducing a common currency in EU by the year of 2002. Therefore we are, at least formally, obligated to join EMU. However, the Swedish government has not yet decided whether Sweden should join or not. I think this is a mistake and a typical example of the government's all too cautious attitude in this question. I will give a few examples that I think speak very clearly in favour for a Swedish membership. In my opinion, the most important reason is the fact that Sweden then will have a chance to get a larger influence on the future development of EMU as well as EU. If we choose not to join EMU, we will inevitably lose political power that will instead belong to the group of countries that already has the biggest influence, such as Germany and France. Beside the increased influence, Sweden also gets a chance to contribute to a deeper integration between EU-countries. Sweden has a duty in helping EU remain an insurance against wars within Europe. If the whole EMU-project would collapse, it would weaken the European cooperation, which would also lead to a weakening of the whole idea of EU as a peace project. What I mean by this is that if EU succeeds in their plans to expand EU to include also the eastern countries of Europe, the risks of a civil war such as that in former Jugoslavia, would be considerably smaller, since it would be easier to discover and react to the problems in time. One of the main arguments EMU opponent's uses is that they do not want the Swedish Krona to be changed to Euro. They feel that we should stick to our traditions and keep the notes and coins that the Swedish people are used to. I can partly agree on their arguments when it comes to the economic part, because the Euro has not been very stabile since it was introduced by the beginning of 2000. I can understand that many people get anxious when they see how the Euro is developing, even though I think its just natural that a currency is a bit shaky on its first years. What I have a harder time understanding is the sudden care for the - what it seems - esthetic look at this issue. I think it would be tragic if our cultural heritage lies in the money, we shouldnt make a big issue about how the money looks since its just metal and paper, a tool to enable us to buy and sell things. Another common opinion among EMU-opponents is that the question should be decided in an election, since they are convinced that the Swedish people would vote against a membership. According to the latest surveys they may very well be right. I think an election might be a good idea, but I have a couple of doubts: first of all, if there were to be an election, it would probably just be an advising one, like it was in the EU-election. Secondly, the clumsy way the government handled the EU-election, by providing the Yes-side with way bigger resources could very well be repeated. That would lead to a huge displeasure among the Swedish people if the Yes-side won, and the election wouldnt be considered a fair one. In brief, the question whether or not Sweden should join The European Monetary Union is a very important one, but the way the Swedish government is handling it does not help the Swedish people at all. Since the positive sides of a membership in my opinion are way bigger, I think we should join. We have paid great money to be part of the European Union and think we should make sure to benefit from it.
EE124	1	﻿ Lily - a woman dependent upon men and society Nancy Walker claims that Edna in The Awakening " is controlled by her own emotions, not by men or society" (256) The character Lily in the novel The House of Mirth is almost the complete opposite of Edna. She is calculating and knows what she is doing, but at the same time she is dependent upon, and thereby controlled by, society and men. She knows what is expected of her and behaves according to that, using her eloquence and beauty to get what she wants, that is wealth and admiration. Lily is controlled by men and society for the following reasons: To begin with, Lily's upbringing has taught her to hate dinginess and crave wealth and also how to get what she wants, which are the features that will pave way for dependency. Secondly, since she has no fortune of her own she needs to ensnare a man whom she can marry in order to keep up her luxurious lifestyle, which will make her dependent upon, and thereby controlled by them. Thirdly, Lily is dependent upon society since it means everything to her. She needs the admiration of men and women in her presence in order to feel that she is someone. To begin with, Lily is brought up in a world of luxury with a mother who hates dinginess and lives as if she is richer than she really is. She has "been brought up in the faith that, whatever it cost, one must have a good cook, and be what Mrs. Bart called 'decently dressed'" (Wharton 1993: 30). Lily needs expensive dresses and hats so she can show her beauty in society. She has the same opinion as her mother about keeping up appearances and applies this way of thinking for example to her choice of hotel where to stay for the winter period: "The hotel being on the edge of a fashionable neighbourhood, the price of the few square feet she was to occupy was considerably in excess of her means; but she found a justification for her dislike of poorer quarters in the argument that, at this particular juncture, it was of the utmost importance to keep up a show of prosperity." (Wharton 1993: p 246) When comparing Edna and Lily, they have been raised in almost the same way, but Edna, according to Nancy Walker "is denying what she has been raised to believe" (Walker: p 253). Lily does the opposite, she imbibes what her mother teaches her and makes those values into her own, Gerty once commented on her need of luxury in a conversation with Selden: "You know how dependent she has always been on ease and luxury -how she has hated what was shabby and ugly and uncomfortable. She can't help it-she was brought up with those ideas, and has never been able to find her way out of them." (Wharton 1993: 270-271) Lily's upbringing does not only give her a taste for refinement and wealth and make her scared of poverty and dinginess, but it also teaches her how to use her skills to get what she wants from men. Her mother has for example taught her how to charm her father: "She leaned confidently toward her father: he seldom refused her anything, and Mrs Bart had taught her to plead with him when her own entreatises failed." (Wharton 1993: 32) So, a craving for money and luxury is established already in Lily's childhood and is also nurtured through her life with rich people. As a child she also learns from her mother how she is to get what she wants, that is, by manipulating and snaring men. Through this lifestyle a 19th century woman will, if she doesn't inherit money, become dependent upon men and also the society which demands refinement and wealth. Secondly, since Lily prefers a costly lifestyle she knows that she is dependent upon men in order to support herself, that is, she needs to marry a wealthy man. The fact that Lily is very calculative when she considers the persons whose wealth she might marry, shows how dependent she is of them. For example, when she sets her mind on ensnaring Mr Percy Gryce she advances very systematically. Lily knows that Mr Gryce's main interest is his Americana, she uses Selden to regain more knowledge of them and then she pretends to bump into Mr Gryce on the train and listens to his boring talk. She follows up this initial encounter at Bellomont and this is where we learn what she thinks of him and also how women of her class and time were thinking: "She had been bored all the afternoon by Percy Gryce - the mere thought seemed to waken an echo of his droning voice - but she couldn't ignore him on the morrow, she must follow up her success, must submit to more boredom, must be ready with fresh compliances and adaptabilities, and all on the bare chance that he might ultimately decide to do her the honour of boring her for life" (Wharton 1993: 25) Lily never considers marrying out of love, since only love cannot provide her with the necessary means to keep up her lifestyle. She is probably in love with Selden, but her emotions for him does not make her give up every thought of a rich husband. A few times her emotions have hindered her from reaching her goals, the best example is perhaps when Lily first talks with Selden and then takes a walk with him, instead of Mr Gryce, as she had promised to. Perhaps she throws away her chance to a rich marriage due to her interest in Selden and she comments upon it herself: "While her friend reproached her for missing the opportunity to eclipse her rivals, she was once more battling with imagination with the mounting tide of indebtedness from which she had so nearly escaped. What wind of folly had driven her out again on those dark seas?" (Wharton 1993: 77) That wind of folly was perhaps love, but she is far to calculative and understanding of her situation to follow her emotions. Instead she starts to think of new ways to escape poverty, namely by letting Mr Gus Trenor invest money for her. She cannot do this herself, both because she isn't familiar with financial matters and because women were not permitted to hhave an active part in business life, so she has to let a man do it for her. Lily is now forced to be nice and kind to a man who she does not like at all, but she is willing to do it because her desire for money is stronger than her reluctance for him, as is shown on page 85: "Even the immediate one [demand that life makes] of letting Trenor, as they drove homeward, lean a little nearer and rest his hand reassuringly on hers, cost her only a momentary shiver of reluctance." And in this moment, she is still calculating, as is shown a few lines further down: "It was part of the game to make him feel that her appeal had been an uncalculated impulse, provoked by the liking he inspired [...]" (Wharton 1993: 85) So, once more she has set her emotions aside and adapted to the situation, allowing herself to be controlled by a man in order to gain wealth. She behaves in the way that is expected of her, putting her own emotions aside and adapting to a new situation, but at the same time she is somewhat in controll, since all the things she does serves her own purposes. Thirdly, Lily is dependent upon society since it means everything to her. The key into that circle in society where she wants to belong iss beauty. Since she has this feature "these people whom she had ridiculed and yet envied were glad to make a place for her in the charmed circle about which all her desires revolved. They were not as brutal and self-engrossed as she had fancied- or rather, since it would no longer be necessary to flatter and humour them, that side of their nature became less conspicuous. (Wharton 1993: 50) Lily changes her mind about the persons in the rich world when she becomes a part of that world herself. This can also be seen a little further down on the same page: "They were lords of the only world she cared for, and they were ready to join her to their ranks and let her lord it with them. Already she felt within her a stealing allegiance to their standards, an acceptance of their limitations, a disbelief in the things they did not believe in, a contemptuous pity for the people who were not able to live as they lived" (Wharton 1993: 50) She adapts once more and behaves as a woman is supposed to behave. By letting this society become her life she becomes dependent upon them, because without them she has no life. Lily also yearns for the admiration of men and women in her presence in order to feel that she is someone. She knows that a women in her position will be judged by her beauty, and since she knows that she is very attractive she craves for admiration from everybody. Lily "cared less for the quality of the admiration received than for its quantity" (Wharton 1993: 136) She wants to be the centre of her world, which can be seen on page 60: "All her plans for the day had been built on the assumption that it was to see her [italics mine] that Selden had come to Bellomont." An example that shows how dependent Lily is of society is her behaviour when she has been excluded from it and strives to regain her lost place among those she knows how to interact with. Lily cannot start a new life since her upbringing has taught her to crave wealth and hate dinginess, and she cannot live without the admiring looks from those "that matter" in society. The only way of life that fulfils and where she knows how to act is the one that she is no longer part of. In an attempt to recover her lost position in society she wants to marry Mr Rosedale, but finds that he is no longer interested of marrying her, since she no longer has a role in the society he wishes to be part of. Lily finds that she cannot go back to her old lifestyle in any way, so she ends her life, consciously or not, in a suitable, lady-like way, by committing suicide when the problems grew to heavy for hear to bear. This shows very clearly how dependent she is upon society, since she can not go on living and not being a part of the rich society. In conclusion, Lily's upbringing is what has caused her appetite for wealth and fame - she has learned to hate dinginess and strive for money and a polished lifestyle. She has been provided with the right tool to succeed in the society she wants to be a part of, namely her beauty and she is well aware of how people in her presence are affected by it and she uses it in a very calculative manner in order to try to get what she wants, that is money and admiration. This hollow life has made her dependent upon society as a mean by which she can define herself and she has also become dependent upon men, since the only way for her to gain wealth is by marrying a rich man. Lily does not consider marrying for love, marriage seems to be only a tool to obtain wealth, a tool to serve her purposes. She can put up with being bored the rest of her life if she has enough glamour and money. Lily's dependence of society can also be seen in her behaviour when she has been excluded from it- as an outcast she does not know how to live, and instead of trying to cope with her new life she tries to regain her lost place in society. Her values are those of a 19th century woman, her behaviour in order to achieve her goals are so too and she adapts in order to fit into the society everyone longs to be a part of. The bottom line is that Lily craves for wealth, she also needs money to be able to cling to society and in order to get that she considers marrying for money - the only way she knows to get wealthy. Lily is indeed a woman of her time. Walker, Nancy: Feminist or Naturalist? In: The Awakening by Chopin, Kate,1994: 2nd ed. Norton & Company Inc. Wharton, Edith, 1993:The House of Mirth Penguin Books Ltd$$$﻿ Let homosexual couples adopt children! In the Dagens Nyheter 99-09-27 there was an article that argued against homosexual couples having the right to adopt children. The arguments that were used concentrated on what was best for the child that was to be adopted, a viewpoint I completely agree with, but I found their arguments to be invalid. Firstly, that children shouldn't be adopted since they will have difficulties in their lives, if adopted by homosexual parents. Secondly, that legitimate adoptions to Sweden might decrease since the majority of the biological mothers or representatives for orphans don't want to give their child up for adoption to homosexual couples. Thirdly that there should be no more experimenting with the lives of children that are adopted. These arguments might seem valid when out of the context, but I will argue against this article in order to show that homosexual couples are not less suitable to be parents than heterosexual couples are. To begin with, it is argued that it is not right to let homosexual couples adopt children, since these children would go through hard times. It is not specified in the article what kind of problems and obstacles these children would encounter, but I believe that this argument concerns problems in society, such as mobbing or other kind of negative responses from society regarding the configuration of the family of the child. Nevertheless, every child can face hard times and problems in every kind of family, it doesn't have to be a family where the parents are homosexual. Joakim Anrell writes in the Internet magazine that it is an exaggeration to blame all the problems in a family on the fact that the parents are homosexual. He also points out that there is nothing that indicates that problems, when there are some, are caused by the child's parents being homosexual and not by some other factor. Furthermore, if it is in the child's best interest that society shouldn't put it in a situation where it can go through hard times how can then the adoption of coloured children be justified? They too can go through hard times and even be harassed, since there are racist opinions in Sweden today. Since it is clear that it is not only children that live with homosexual parents that can go through hard times, how can it then be used as an argument against adoption by homosexual parents? The second argument concerns what might happen if homosexual couples would be allowed to adopt children. It is argued that the chances of legitimate international adoptions to Sweden might decrease, since homosexual couples are not accepted as parents by the countries that give up children for adoption and the majority of the mothers or representatives for orphans don't want to give a child up for adoption by homosexual couples. It is important to keep up good relations with other countries, but it is equally important not to discriminate a minority that can and want's to help take care of the less fortunate children of the world. A solution to this problem, to both prevent a possible decrease in international adoptions and see too the best of the children by providing them with a good home and a loving family, could perhaps be accomplished by allowing homosexual couples a limited right to adopt children. This could be done in such a way that the persons that give up a child for adoption may decide whether they want the child to be adopted by hetero- or homosexual parents. The number of children given up for adoption by homosexual couples would of course be limited, but this way a few more children could get a good home. Perhaps the limitation wont prevent the countries from stopping adoptions to Sweden, but it would be an acceptable compromise, at least for the time being. This limitation could later be removed when society has accepted families that consist of homosexual parents. The third and final argument states that there should be no more experimenting with the lives of the children that are adopted. Since the argument isn't further developed it is hard to see what is meant by it. I assume that giving a child homosexual parents is what in this case is meant by experimenting. In a motion to the Swedish Parliament Andreas Carlgren writes that in a study conducted by the university of Gothenburg concerning children growing up with homosexual parents concluded that it is not the configuration of the family which affects the child most, instead it is how the children are raised and what kind of support they receive in society. This argument also suggests that it has been accepted to experiment with heterosexual parents - These have all been different individuals who have been investigated thoroughly before being allowed to adopt a child. There is no way of knowing what happened to those heterosexual families after a few years, perhaps they couldn't take care of the child properly or perhaps they became abusive, still the child and the parents were given a chance. Homosexuals are not even allowed to apply for adoption and be examined and I believe that that right should apply to everyone. Only this way it is possible to find the best possible parents to a child. In conclusion, homosexual couples should be allowed to adopt children but that right should perhaps be limited in the beginning. Every child in every kind of family might go through hard times and this argument can therefore not be used against homosexual couples. Decreasing chances to adopt children also for heterosexuals could be the result if homosexual couples would be allowed to adopt children. That is a risk society should be willing to take. There are mothers that agree to their child being adopted by homosexuals and letting these children live with to people of the same sex wouldn't be to experiment with their lives. A study made by the university of Gothenburg shows that the constellation of the family is less important than how the child is raised and how it is supported by society. The right to apply for adoption and be examined should apply to everyone. If the homosexual couple is denied an adoption because their financial situation isn't satisfactory, it would be acceptable. If they are denied an adoption because their home doesn't look suitable for a child to live in, that too would be acceptable. It would not be acceptable to deny them the chance of adopting a child simply because they are homosexual. In an article in the Dagens Nyheter 99-11-27, it was argued why homosexual couples mustn't be allowed to adopt children. What is best for the child is what is most important, it is also important for the child to know later in life that the adoption was carried out in an proper way. International adoptions to Sweden might stop if a law was introduced, granting homosexual couples the right to adopt children, since many countries don't want to give children up for adoption by homosexuals. The right for homosexual couples to adopt children internationally would have to be preceeded by working for the homosexuals' rights in other parts of the world.
EE127	1	﻿ Use your brain use a helmet A bicycle is a cheap and excellent means of transport that takes you anywhere you like. It is not harmful to the environment as cars are and it is good for your health and it is an economical advantage to use as many people have discover over the years when prices on petrol is increasing. There is one thing though that not many of the cyclists have discovered, the cycle-helmet. It is an excellent protection and it is a cheap life insurance in case of an accent. The cycle-helmet is something all cyclists should wear, not just our little ones. When our little ones is about to learn cycling we teach them to wear a cycle-helmet as a protection in case of an accident on the staggering ride. That is what every protecting parent do to their children. But the children get older and they start to protest against wearing the cycle-helmet. Maybe it is just because that their friends do not wear one or, even worse, their parents do not. The question is why don't the parents wear a helmet themselves? Maybe it is because they claims that they know how to rid a bicycle and therefor will not be involved in an accident, or, as I have heard objections as, that a cycle-helmet will ruin their hairstyle. I admit that the hairstyle will be ruined by wearing a helmet. And most of the grown-ups know how to ride a cycle. But when do one know there should be an accident? And what is a ruined hairstyle in comparison with a destroyed life by an accident A cycle-helmet is a protection, which all cyclists ought to wear. We know that children not always do as they are told, they usually do as you do, whether you like it or not. So the best way to make them wear a cycle-helmet is to wear one yourself, despite of a ruined hairstyle. In spite of the fact that the bicycle is an excellent means of transport the cyclist is the only road-user that is totally unprotected in traffic. The driver is safe in his or her car, which have all the latest safety equipment as safety belt and airbags. The cyclist's only protection is a cycle-helmet. The National Road Safety Office has through the years had information campaign to pursued people wear a cycle-helmet. There have been film commercials and advertising bill all over the country about this matter We have had many chances to learn by this information that the head is the most fragile part of one's body and one single knock on the head can change ones life forever. A skull injury can mean everything from personality change to disturbance of balance, speech disorders or the worse, the death. But there are still a large numbers of people who are not wearing a helmet. Some of them are of the opinion that they look silly wearing one. Maybe it is not the prettiest headgear but it serves its purpose. If the adults set up a good example, to all children and start to wear a cycle-helmet in traffic it will turn out to be a self-evident thing to wear. Like it is with the safety belt, everyone use it now without any objections. Statistic shows that most of the cyclists that are injured in traffic suffers from skull injuries and if they had wear a cycle-helmet the injuries wouldn't had been that seriously. Why people does not wear a helmet after the information campaigns that have been run by the National Road Safety Office through the years are a mystery to me. It is time to ignore that you may lock silly in a cycle-helmet and that the hairstyle will be ruined as long as it may save your life. It is your only protection in traffic. And the unnecessary high cost of medical treatment could be spent on more important matters.$$$﻿y relationship to English has generally been about talking and listening. It was when I first came to read at KOMVUX I actually first started to do the writhing and reading. At compulsory school it was just boring, hard work and dull teachers, who actually made the lessons quit boring. Although we had stand-in teachers from time to time, they made the lessons more interesting. It was quite fun at school at those occasions. When I left the Compulsory school I guess I knew that much English I could make me understood if ever necessary. I didn't go to Upper secondary school after Compulsory school; I started to work instead. My English was in a deep sleep through the years until I decided to start working in the Swedish merchant navy. It was the first time I actually had the opportunity to practice my school English. I improved my English during the years at sea, but only when it comes to talking and listening. I can't say that my vocabulary very big. I guess I stick to the words I'm familiar with. But don't we all Do that from time to time. Hopefully we don't make to many mistakes then. All through the years at sea I did never reflected about that I could read an English book to improve my English. I don't think we even had any English books on board. Well if we did I didn't look for them. After spending seven years at sea I decided to change career and went to a Folk high school to get an Upper secondary school competence. During my year at the Folk high school I had English at the schedule. As I can remember it we didn't do much reading or writing. It was more off talking and listening comprehension. This year I learned one thing, as I never reflected over before, the different between British English and American English. It was mainly because we first had an American teacher who taught us the American way of speaking. The next semester we got a Swedish teacher who preferred the B.E. He had a hard time to teach us the British pronunciation. At this very day I'm rather convinced that I still have a mix of both B.E and A.E. After my year at the Folk high school the life went on ashore. One day I felt it was time to do something about my situation as an unemployed and I went to KOMVUX to, ones again, get an Upper secondary school competence. The other one from the Folk high school was too old. At KOMVUX, for the first time, I got in touch with the written word in book form. Well that's not really true, I have had tried to read a novel before but I gave it up before finishing it. This time I had to finish it and review it to the class. From the beginning it was hard work but I learned to enjoy it, and I still do. But I don't read that much English literature I must admit. During the English course at KOMVUX we had to hand in essays as well. From a start I had no bigger problems with that but at the B-level I had a teacher who wanted us to hand in essay after essay about different subjects and so I did. My essays was always marked whit red all over, but I never got any explanation about all the mistakes I did, so I could chance them It went from enjoy writing to something I disliked. After KOMVUX I haven't been writing one word until this very moment. And I still have the problem when it comes to writing English as you obvious can see And I'm still unsecured when it comes to writing, thanks to my teacher at B-level at KOMVUX Now when I look back at my evaluation about my English all through the years I realise I could have improved my English by reading and writing more than I have done, but I didn't. I actually didn't know I was going to become a teacher one year ago, but now I'm here and I haven't got cold feet yet.
EE008	1	﻿ Why Are the Young Abandoning Party Politics? Today's youth is not as interested in party politics as were earlier generations. The parties' youth organizations have lost more than 60% of their members between 1984 and 1995 (Larsson 1995:17) and the political parties are held in low esteem by many young people. This is very serious according to some experts because the parties are the foundation of our political system. It used to be that joining a party was the natural thing to do if you wanted to get involved, but this is not the case anymore, according to the political scientists Bück and Müller (199?: 293). Many people are very committed to changing things, but they choose to work outside the party system. They will often join a non-governmental organizations, that focuses on the one issue that they feel is most important, such as human rights or the environment. Nevertheless, the parties are still the most important political organizations. Why is it that they are losing ground among young people? A possible cause is that young people do not like the working methods of the parties, which are often perceived as typical of the generation of politicians that are now leading them. The political scientist Anders Westerholm points out that it is important to differentiate between the interest in politics, which is actually increasing among the young, and the trust in politicians, which is declining (Forselius 1991:13). Many young people associate politics with bald middle-aged men who do not always have the best of the people in mind. The last years' scandals involving politicians spending tax money on foolish things, like porn clubs, have certainly not strengthened the trust in them. Moreover, politics is often perceived as stressful, unglamorous, and ill paid. The parties are hierarchically organized and it will take a long time to work your way toward the top. The older politicians are sometimes unwilling to let younger people into the top of the party. Some young members of Moderaterna complained about that recently when Bo Lundgren was elected the new leader of the party. Furthermore, there is a gap between the generations when it comes to what topics they consider most important, scholars claim. Young people are not as interested in classical political issues such as the fair distribution of wealth and resources, questions that have dominated Swedish politics for decades. Instead, young people tend to be more interested in "heavy" existential questions like environmental issues and their own inner growth (Forselius 1991:13). We are perhaps less materialistic, and the parties don't deal with the topics that we find most important. Another cause for young people to look to alternative ways of getting involved in politics is that they want to see results fast, and the political system cannot offer that. It is in its nature to work cautiously; proposals travel slowly through the political system before a decision can be taken. Changes do not happen overnight. With the new media technology information is spread around the world very quickly. Changes in politics and society often occur fast, and the political system cannot always keep up. Non-governmental organizations, so called NGOs, such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace are often considered more effective vehicles of change. The work of NGOs is often more visible and perhaps more "glamorous" than that of the political parties. Besides, it may be easier to stand behind the goals of a non-governmental organization than supporting an entire party program. Working for a NGO together with other people who also feel very strongly about a cause can create a sense of belonging and verify your identity. Bück and Müller point out that the political parties have lost their socializing function (Bück & Müller199?: 291). Someone who is interested in politics can turn to the media for information or join a non-governmental organization. There are many alternatives to the political parties. It is likely that the parties will remain the most important players on the political scene for many years to come. However, the fact that fewer and fewer young people choose to join a party is a well-established trend. It is impossible to make an exhaustive list of the causes of such a complex trend, but I believe that some of the most important ones are disregard for the working methods of the parties; the gap between the generations when it comes to what issues they consider most important; and the proliferation of non-governmental organizations that are perceived as better suited for dealing with the problems that arise in modern society.$$$﻿ Granting Homosexual Couples the Right to Adopt Recently an editorial that appeared in Svenska Dagbladet (1999-10-03) stated that homosexual couples must not be given the right to adopt children. According to the writer, adopted children are very vulnerable. They have been separated from their biological parents; they have often had several caretakers; and they have left their native country at an early age. Growing up in a family that differs from other families would be adding to their trauma. In this essay I intend to argue against this view. I do not think that having two parents of the same sex necessarily has to be a bad experience, which the author of the editorial seems to imply. People who are homosexual have experienced being cast as different, and that experience can benefit a child who feels rootless. The author of the editorial does not seem to think that homosexuals are worse parents than heterosexuals (or at least s/he does not say so); he is afraid that the child will be harassed for having parents that are homosexual. But according to Niclas Berggren, a member of RFSL's (the national organization for sexual equality) board of directors, research has shown that children growing up with gay or lesbian parents are not worse off than are children with heterosexual parents, and they are able to make friends as easily (Svenska Dagbladet 1999-10-07). It is cynical to deny gays and lesbians the right to adopt because their child may be teased; all children suffer the risk of being teased. We see then that having homosexual parents need not be traumatic. There is every reason to believe that homosexual couples can make just as good adoptive parents as heterosexual couples can. The Swedish authorities interview couples who wish to adopt and their suitability as parents is carefully considered. Assuming that homosexual couples will be given the right to adopt eventually, those that pass these tests may actually have advantages over many heterosexual couples. Berggren argues that their experiences of being homosexual in a society where heterosexuality is the norm will help them understand the feelings of alienation that their child may feel growing up. The "coming out" experience have afforded them maturity and knowledge of what it is like not to be completely accepted by society, and an adopted child may benefit greatly from this. Many Swedes who were adopted from another country feel rootless as children, and feel that they do not quite belong in the Swedish society. Because of this, Svenska Dagbladet's editorial argues, they must grow up in a safe and peaceful environment. I think that gay and lesbian couples are just as capable as heterosexual parents of giving them that. The editorial writer goes on to say that the gay and lesbian movement is trying to use children as tools for gaining legal rights and acceptance from mainstream society. This implies that people who are homosexual have ulterior motives for wanting the right to adopt, which I think is very unfair to assume. I cannot believe that a homosexual couple that wishes to adopt a child does so because they want to further a cause. They do it because they long for a child and know that they are able to provide a good and loving home environment for him or her. That must be the starting point, and it is in itself reason enough to give homosexual couples the legal right to adopt. If we accept that they can be just as good parents as anyone else, we must give them that right; and, in time, because they will be fairly common, families with two parents of the same sex will not be looked upon as abnormal. Naturally this process will take time, but I feel certain that it will happen. Today many households consist of a single parent and a child, or unmarried couples with children, all constellations that were judged inappropriate not long ago. Granting homosexual couples the right to adopt would be admitting that they are just as fit to be parents as are heterosexuals, and it would be an important signal to the rest of the world. The author of the editorial argues that it does not matter what Sweden decides; no country in the world will give up its children for adoption to a country that allows gays to adopt. This is unfortunate, but I still think that Swedish lawmakers should set a good example. If we accept that gays and lesbians are just as good parents as are heterosexuals, should we not focus on changing people's attitudes toward homosexuality instead of fiercely denying people who are homosexual rights that everyone else has? I agree that children should not be used to sway opinions. Gays should be given the right to adopt because they are able to provide a good environment for the child, not in order for them to gain acceptance by mainstream society. However, granting them that right would also have the good effect of normalizing families with parents of the same sex, and it would be a powerful statement to all homophobes. Summary In an editorial (Svenska Dagbladet 1999-10-03), the author argues that the gay and lesbian movement is trying to use children as tools for gaining legal rights and acceptance from mainstream society. S/he feels that adoption should be about what is best for the child, and not what is best for people who are homosexual. According to the author, adopted children are very vulnerable. They have been separated from their parents and natural surroundings at an early age, and growing up in a family that differs significantly from other families would be adding to their trauma. Furthermore, all adoptions have to be approved by the child's native country, and there is no country that would allow its children to be adopted by gay or lesbian couples in Sweden.
EE450	0	﻿ Evaluation English, My English! When you write an essay in which you are to evaluate your personal strengths and weaknesses in a subject it's important to be objective and to admit that even though you might think you know that subject very well, there's always something that needs improving. In this essay I will discuss my knowledge in the English language pointing out what I'm good at and what I'm great at (sorry! I obviously mean not so good at). Well, let's get started then. I'm going to start off by talking about my ability to understand spoken English. I consider this to be something that I'm very good at. Of course it gets harder to understand if the one you're talking to has got a strange accent but that's a common problem I guess. As I've never stayed for any longer periods of time in an English speaking country and therefore not been exposed to hearing English day in and day out, I have tried to compensate this by spending considerable hours in front of the TV (watching television shows in English) and listening to a lot of English music. Some teachers might disagree with me when I give TV and pop music this much credit for improving listening comprehension saying that the language in the shows that young people watch is nothing but grammatically incorrect slang, not proper English. This might be true in some respects but I think that in order to successfully acquire a foreign language you have to be exposed to it as often as possible and that is where TV comes into the picture. The next thing that I'm going to talk about is my skills in speaking English. Having said earlier in this essay that I understand very well what people say to me I'll now try to figure out if I can answer them and indulge in conversation. My initial response when I asked myself whether or not I'm a good speaker of the English language was no, I'm not that good. I wouldn't say that I am terrible at speaking English though. I haven't got any problems in making myself understood but sometimes when I speak I get the feeling that my pronunciation slips up and my English gets a Swedish touch to it. In a spontaneous conversation it's sometimes hard to be grammatically correct when you are expected to respond quickly. I'm not worried about my ability to speak English though. I have no doubt if I just would spend some time in an English speaking country my accent would improve and I'd be more confident in speaking the language. Reading books in English is a great way to expand your vocabulary. Even though you might not know exactly what a certain word means you can always get a good guess of what it means by looking at the context in which it is put. This is one of the reasons why it is so fascinating to read books in English. I've always read a lot in English. When I was younger I read a lot of magazines (mostly comics and computer magazines) but as I became older and more interested in the English language I began to read more advanced literature. This has resulted in me becoming a quite competent reader of English. The last aspect of my knowledge in English that I'm going to talk about is my ability to write in English. I purposely saved this topic for the end of my essay because I thought I would then have an up to date feeling of how my writing is. This is the first essay I've written in quite a while so naturally I felt a bit awkward when I started to write it but as got into it I felt more comfortable. In the upper level secondary school we wrote quite a few essays in English and that has really helped me to improve my writing. I think it's a lot easier to write in English than to speak English because you can test different sentences and to a greater extent think things through. Writing is probably the area that suffers the most if you don't do it continuously. That's why your first essays of a term tend to be somewhat poorer than the latter ones. Hopefully this essay has managed to show my different skills in the English language taking up my strong and weak sides. As I've written this essay I have found that there are many things to improve. I can only hope that while I improve these weaknesses I'll find many more parts of the English language that will fascinate and interest me. So it's with great confidence that I look at my future studies in the English language.$$$﻿ Unhealthy Television Almost 50 years ago, television entered our homes. The television came to revolutionize our living rooms, our habits and our life in general. A new level of entertainment was brought into our lives. A new way of understanding, a new way of being together and new way of thinking. Most people think of the television in a positive way. The TV is often seen as a relaxing entertainer, a demandless teacher and sometimes even as a beloved friend. But is TV-watching always positive to our lives or is there a higher end? That is what I would like to discuss in this short essay. The TV is by far the most popular medium. We spend hours and hours watching at it. Our children and our youth are watching more TV than ever. An evening in the sofa combined with a day in an office, which is a common work- or school enviroment, makes a day without much movement. Over time, this can seriously reduce your physical ability and make our body more fragile. Also, decreased energy consumption can cause fatness, which in it self will worsen your physical condition. Additionally, a passive life will cause mental tierdness. Tierdness car be really hazardous. It can cause physical problems, especially with your stomach and your metabolism It can even in some cases cause chronical musclepain. But more seriously, tierdness can cause serious mental problems like concentration-problems, decreased simultaneous-thinking ability and perplexity. Mental tierdness may even cause axiety and depression. oreover, prevalent TV-practices can disturb your social life. Many people turn on the TV instead of calling friends. Instead of meeting and socializing with friends many watch TV on a Saturday night. This would not be a problem if the TV was an acceptable substitution, but it is not. Socializing is very important for our overall well-being and unfortunately, loneliness is an increasing problem. This often turns out as a negative spiral. Fewer friends means more TV. Furthermore, some debaters even claim that too much TV might lower the overall intellectual level. For instance, TV reports offer less analysis, less background facts and less information about the wider significance of news than newspapers do. Because of the TV-editors persuit of viewers they will give acion-news higher priority than news that is really relevant. The TV nature makes time more critical than papers in a book. Less will be said, fewer persons will be able to present their pespectives and the perspectives will be more abstracly explained. But after all, the viewer will be fully responsible for her/his own actions. I am not implying that TV-viewing should be forbidden or restricted. I just want to make you aware of the downsides of TV-viewing. With your reason, you will able to design your TV-practices for yourself. To sum up: Make sure that your TV-practice does not make you passive. Move, excercise and dance. Keep socializing with your friends. Use other mediums as a complementary to TV in order to gain better understanding of the world. Last but not least, if you have a healthy TV-practice, do not be afraid of watching TV. If you are aware of the risks, TV-watching should not be dangerous.
EE451	1	﻿Some times I envy my mother. Not especially because her occupation is to teach - as a matter of fact, I am rather surprised that I could think about becoming a teacher, having grown up in a family full of teachers spending all their time preparing lessons, mark student essays and so on - but for her sense of learning different languages without any difficulties. I am certainly not like that myself! I have to get a real good sense of the language first and hopefully, after that, become able to learn more about the grammar rules and the structure of the language. During my time in school, I never particularly liked the English lessons. It was not that I thought it was unimportant and I would not had mind at all managing quite a few different languages, but I did not find it very exciting during the time I had to learn the language. I have tried to remember what we were taught during the English lessons, but I am sorry to admit that I can hardly remember anything except from a few fractions. I managed to get the grade "3", but I am sure it was not a very strong one. Listening to English was quite all right and I did not find it difficult to read English texts either, even if I almost never read any English books and would not have managed to read the daily newspaper with any great success. I do not think I was very much trained to actually speak the English language - at least not in a more freely way. Concerning the written English, mine was not very good either, even if I did write a few essays in school. I do not believe my knowledge of grammar was particularly good! I would not have been attending this English course if I had not been working in England as an au-pair. That time made me fall in love with the British English! It took its time, though. I know I improved my English quite a lot during my stay in England, especially in the speaking and listening point of view. I manage to speak fluently, even though it was not of course perfectly, and it was just on the phone that I sometimes still found it difficult to understand the spoken language. I was quite used to the English by the time I went back home to Sweden again and I remember that I was even using some peculiar expressions in Swedish the first days. My sister asked me where to put the tray and I answered, pointing with my finger towards the cupboard: because I had the English expression "it goes there" in mind. (In Swedish that sounds like the tray is walking away by it self...) I believe the situation confirmed that thinking in English was naturally to me by that time. I also attended an English course, "the Cambridge First Certificate in English" at the South Oxfordshire Technical College in Henley-on-Thames, where I was living with my au-pair-family. I believe it was a good idea to practice not just the oral use of the language, but also the written. I did not find it very difficult at that time - not even the written work - and I did not need to put very much effort in doing my homework. By the time I was going back to Sweden again, my English course was not finished yet. I joined the same international course in Uppsala when I was back in Sweden again, which made it possible for me to continue to get my graduation. At that time I met the next frustration; suddenly the English course seemed to be at another level - much more difficult! I had to work very hard to keep up with it. I was no longer surrounded by the English language 24 hours a day and I never used it myself either. No wonder I felt a bit anxious to open the letter with the results from the exam when it arrived in the letterbox. Never the less I did reach the highest grade - a big A! Ever since - it is almost 16 years ago now! - I have been convinced that my English is rather good and fluent (even though I very seldom get the opportunity to use it). Then, just recently, frustration number three occurred to me: I wrote the diagnostic examination to attend the English A-level course. I still can feel my selfconfidence shivering after the examination! I disappointingly found out that language knowledge certainly is not going to stay in your mind, like books in the bookshelf, if you are not using it! Of course that is so! How could I believe anything else? Well, at least I will not give up! I do want to learn the English language and I do want to become an English teacher even if I am very well aware of the fact that I have to work very hard to get there!$$$﻿ Legalisation of narcotics or not? The matter of whether to legalise narcotics or not has been lively discussed for many years. Despite that fact, it is still a current subject of importance not to be ignored, especially due to the lately increasing use of narcotics by the teenagers, as a "weekend-ecstasy". This is a rather complex topic to discuss, why I have chosen three main subjects to concentrate on: Would the curiosity decrease and lead to less use of narcotics, if the drugs where legalised? Is it up to every single individual to make their own decision whether to use drugs or not - while no one else would have to suffer? The society already has huge costs referring to the use of alcohol, so why would alcohol be legal if narcotics are not? Personally, I find myself to be quite curious. I also want to make my own decisions as an individual. But still I am very determined that the legalisation of narcotics would lead to a terrible and unnecessary decay of the Swedish society. Even if I where curious enough to test narcotics, I do not believe I would be less curious if it was legal. On the contrary I think the legalisation would increase my possibility of trying narcotics, because it would be much easier to get hold of it. It would probably be considerably cheaper to. A legalisation would actually bring the message that "narcotics can not be that bad - after all, it is accepted", which would make even more people have a liberal view of narcotics. I am sure that would definitely lead to an increase of the use of it, according to many psychological studies. From another psychological point of view, it seems to be rather important that you, as an individual, feel that you have the possibility to make your own decision how to live your life. I agree, as long as your actions do not have a negative effect on other people. But this is just the point that makes the argument that "every individual has the right to make their own choice whether to take narcotics or not" is not a durable argument why narcotics should be legal. People might think that using drugs is really "up to them", no one else has to suffer. But that is certainly not true. The whole society suffers of many effects that could easily be referred to drugs. A considerable part of the criminality and health-care-costs and the costs of treating the lately escalating number of adolescent people who need psychological help due to the use of the rather new, and among youths very popular drug, ecstasy are just a few examples of the negative effects. The worst effect of how the use of narcotics effects people in the user's surrounding is the social one, I think. My best friend's brother has been using narcotics of different kind since he was about 13 (he is 36 today). He will never become a mature, responsible adult, even if he would succeed in getting rid of his addiction to drugs (one of the effects of hashish is that it stops the psychological development if used during the adolescent). His use of drugs has effected his whole family's life in many tragic ways, and it still does. Unluckily, the argument that every single person must have the possibility to make their own choice, advocating for legalisation of narcotics, is often considered to be one of the most attractive to the youths during their process to become free and independent individuals. One of the common replies to such an argument as I have mentioned above, is that alcohol also is one of the main reasons to this kind of problems. "So, if alcohol is legal, why should not narcotics be", the advocates of the legalisation of narcotics would say. But, making one terrible mistake does not entitle us to make another one. It is true that we do already have a lot of trouble in our society due to alcohol, which is sad enough. But I do not believe in making alcohol illegal, though, because the use of it has such deep traditional roots in our history and I think this tradition with, for example, the ceremony to drink a toast to someone on a special occasion, would therefore be extremely difficult to change. Another point is that the decomposition of alcohol is much faster than that of marijuana for instance. Marijuana may remain in the body up to about 30 days. That would make it impossible to most people to actually use narcotics even in the weekends, if they are not going to be intoxicated during their time at work. If you drink alcohol in a Saturday evening, you can be pretty sure to be free from it in the Monday morning. But if you smoke a joint of marijuana, you will never know if you are going to have "flashbacks" any time in the following 30 days or not. I do not think that even advocates for the legalisation of narcotics would like to be operated by a doctor intoxicated by marijuana, ecstasy or any other drug. As I mentioned above, the whole society suffers already in many different ways due to drugs of different kinds. Legalisation of narcotics would make that suffering even worse, because it would increase the use of narcotics. It is also certainly not true that the drug-users do not effect any other people. The argument that narcotics ought to be legal because alcohol is legal can not be taken as a durable argument either. If we wish a society where most people are given the possibility to grow up in harmony and become empathetic and responsible adults who cares about other people, we have to make sure that narcotics will never be legalised here in Sweden.
EE453	1	﻿So, now it''s the time for me to develope my English, and a good start from my point of view, is that I really love the English language both to speak and to write. I have noticed that when I listen to and just try to think in English, especially when I haven't done it for a long time, it almost at once feels familiar and (how shall I explain it? ;) funny, I just become happy to hear the language. English was one of my favourite subjects when I was in the senior level and that's probably one reason why I chose English as one of the main topic. And I really are looking forward to this time when I'm going to study English for about sixty points at the university. And as I earlier mentioned, I hope to learn a lot. In this essay, I will tell you a part of how I apprehend my strenghts and weaknesses in listening, reading, speaking and writing in the English language. To start with listening, I can describe my own opinion of my weakness when I for example listen to a tape, I can find it hard to follow when the speed is too fast. But otherwise when I'm listen to someone who just speeks directly to me or at least when it''s "live", I find it quite easy to understand. I remember when we in senior school and in high school did this hearings and were going to answer at questions afterwards and I found it difficult to remember every little thing, and I think that happened because I had some difficulties to follow, I felt like I needed more time to register what they said. But that's something I think is quite easy to learn by listen more in that form. Next skill is reading and to be better at it I think practise is what will be nedeed. Accordingly practise again. I haven''t read as much as I probably would have but now when I have started the first novel in this course, it feels good and I think I follow the content in it. By read a lot you learn lot's of new words because when something is unclear to you while reading, at least I have to check the words up, and it's therefore easier to learn. But it's the same problem in this skill as in the one before, I can find it difficult to understand while it's under pressure and there's a time limit. When you have to be ready in a decided time. Though I think this problem could be away by reading more and increase the vocabulary. About speaking, I have noticed that I use both the British English and the Ame-rican English in my talk. I prefer though the British English, it sounds much more real. To speak loud in front of new people, like now in the class when we don't know each other can be a little nervous but the solution might be found in more practise of speaking. Another "project" I have is to build up my vocabulary because I think I use the same words over and over again. It's kind of irritating when you really know what to say, but you can't find the word for it. But the positive part about me and my speaking is that I really think it's funny and I feel I develope all the time and that it goes pretty fast too. The fourth skill is writing, and maybe this was what I was most "afraid" of, comparing to speak and so on. But actually I find this funny too, and not as bad as I thought it would be, because when you haven't studied for a long time and not used the subject (for this occasion the English language) it seems to me anyway, be more difficult to write than just to speak. I can mention that I really love to write whatever it will be, in Swedish or in English, so therefore I'm very glad that this feels that ok that it really does, working with this assignment. This was a little about my strenghts and weaknesses in four skills within the English language, and to give you a short summery of it, it can be something like this. First I was telling you about listening in English, what problems I have doing it, and what I apprehend is positive. Secondly I brought up reading and what I thought was difficult and the opposite, a little easier, concerning it. Thirdly on the scedule were speaking, and the fourth and last, (eventhough not the "worst in degree in difficulty") according to me), was writing, in whom I likely the other skills, told you about my strenghts and weaknesses in this exciting, scaring, fascinating, sometimes lower your selfconfidense-feeling, but absolute in the end the greatest language in the world.$$$﻿ Let the girls talk If you see a crowd with both boys and girls there are almost only the boys who are shouting at each other. It is also the boys who are laughing highly and loudly and do gestures widely. While the girls stands beside, just watching. But of course they are talking to each other as well but it is the boys who acts as the centre-figures. Some people think it is genetic that boys are more loquacious than girls while girls on the other hand are more sensitive, and emotional. I agree that we (men and women) are different in many ways and one could say that it depends on genetic results but I have also the strong feeling that this problem is built up by humanbeings decades back. I think one important issue in school today would be to encourage girls to stand up for their own beliefs and make their voices to be heard. This could be a step in the right direction towards equality among men and women. The equality of which the importance we are well aware about in the society of today. I think it has to start already in school. Otherwise there is a big risk for the boys to get indoctrinated that this lap between men and women is just as it should be. If the boys ever notices the lap at all. According to a study concerning this problem with silent girls (the book Goodmorning boys and girls by Jan Einarsson and Tor G Hultman) in which there is shown how the time is spent between teachers, boys and girls in school. The writers of the book says that the teacher talks about 2/3 of the time available in a class lection. The remain time approximately 1/3 of which the boys are talking 2/3 and the girls takes what's left. Actually only 1/9 of time is "offered" for the girls. The speak activity is also very unequal distributed between boys and girls. There is almost the same boys and the same few girls who takes speech in class. A couple of the girls doesn't say anything at all. That is a pattern what is reflected in grown-up life but as we can see it is borned during these early years. I think this problem is something for us adults to deal with. Parents, teachers, politicians, everybody have to be aware of this urgent problem and take it seriously if a change is going to come. To eliminate this discrimination against girls between the sexes. Another important clue to connect with this dilemma is when the teacher asks questions. In some way for any reason, to refer to the book I mentioned earlier, it is the boys who gets following questions after the question that was asked. It isn't very often it happens that the girls gets any following questions and that probably doesn't make them more open-wide either. Development demands training and that's also what excpects from school. To help the girls to get more of the boys self-confidence in school could be to let them talk much more than they do. Let the girls understand that their thoughts and knowledge are just as important as the boys probably seems to be for them. I'm aware of the fact that it is an procedure of patience to go through with this but I am convinced that it is definately worth the time it takes. If you did a summery of these factors I have told you about concerning how boys and especially the girls are acting in school. Unfortunately the girls are the subject of an expectating behavior from society. To remain as the well-mannered, nice presency being girls. What would be needed is an awakening within the common people to leed the thoughts into act. There is an obvious direction towards what the girls will meet in common society when they grow up. The clearly segregation and differences between the two sexes. I am certain that in most places of work the majority of the men are in higher salary than most of the women. This is happening even in the modern society of today. To create an equal society within the two sexes we have to start with pieces of the hole matter. Therefore it is a great opportunity for me as an future teacher to start this process in school. I also urge to already working teachers if not dealing with this to do so at once. Remembering the pupils are the future and we as adults have to do our best to let them in to it.
EE371	0	﻿ Why we should introduce free massage as a working benefit Surely all of us have been struck by stress and exhaustion sometime during our lives. But these phenomena are getting more and more common and overwhelming. Many people today suffer a great deal from stress and from getting burned out. These problems do not only concern adults, but also many schoolchildren. Fortunately there are ways to help prevent these so called national diseases. For example, one easy way is through massage, which is a well-known means of relaxing and recovery. This method has been used by people in centuries. My opinion is that every employee should be offered free massage as a part of their working benefits. And since other forms of healthcare are free for people under the age of twenty, massage should be free for them as well. Thus how can everyone benefit from this idea, and how will this improve our everyday lives? To begin with, more and more people are having difficulties with performing a good job at their work, because of factors such as stress and exhaustion. This is not hard to understand since our society is a rapidly developing one, and as a result the demands on our efficiency increase. Many of us work so hard that we are totally exhausted when we come home. As if this is not enough there are a number of duties at home that many of us have to deal with after work. There is simply no time for relaxation. Now, if everyone were to be offered free massage, say once a week at the least, we would become much more relaxed and as a result we would be able to work more effectively. Less people would suffer from stress and, in addition to this, our working environment would become more pleasant and more people would enjoy going to work. However, I do not believe that adults are the only group in need of relaxation in the form of massage. Schoolchildren also suffer a lot from stress and this puts a strain on their concentration and learning ability. Massage, as we all know, not only makes us feel more relaxed, but it increases our blood circulation, and makes us feel more alert. Through massage we can concentrate better and we become more active. This will, in the long run, lead to better educated children, and they will not forget what they learn at school. Of course these massage treatments have to be financed. Nevertheless, in my opinion there will be no big problems financing this project, since the effects of the massage treatments in themselves will be moneysaving. This money can then be used to pay for the expenses. The companies will save money because they will have employees who are more relaxed and therefore can concentrate better and work more effectively. They will do a better job in less time! Furthermore, people will have a better health, and there will be less people on the sick- leave. Thus, the government will not have to pay as much sick benefits, and could instead use this money to sponsor the project. To sum up, I would like to se free massage in the form of a working benefit, because I believe that this would be one great step in the right direction in order to improve peoples health, both physically and mentally. What we need today is a form of relaxation in our stressful lives. As we all know, when we feel relaxed we see the good things in life, we are nicer to one another, and we feel good about our selves. For instance, the body as well as the mind will get stronger, and as a result of this we will be able to resist diseases and handle difficult situations a lot better. In addition to this we will perform better at work and at school.$$$﻿ Let homosexuals adopt Something many people consider a matter of course is that homosexuals always should be equal to heterosexuals. However, many of them who first agree change their attitude when it comes to adoption. This change seems strange to me and if you read on I will explain why. Since homosexuality no longer was considered a sickness, the situation for homosexuals has very well improved, and rather quickly (although not as quickly as I would wish). We live in a modern and multicultural society, and we should know better than to be prejudiced when there are much more important things to do. In Sweden, as in many other countries, homosexuals are allowed to register partnership, which should mean that it has finally been accepted that love between homosexuals is worth as much as love between heterosexuals. The step between understanding that and that homosexuals also would make good parents should not be too far. We can't say that homosexuals and heterosexuals are equal if they are not given the same rights. Still, opponents often say that children with homosexual adoptive parents will be harassed by other children at school, sometimes making it sound as it would be most strange indeed if they wouldn't be so. I can understand that this is a common first reaction, yet this seems very odd to me as I find it hard to believe that children would condemn something like this without influence from their parents or other adults. Moreover, there already are children who live with a homosexual parent and the parent's partner, and there hasn't been proved that these children have problems caused by that. Besides, I think that as long as adoption isn't legal for homosexuals, children living with a homosexual parent with a partner may get the idea that there actually is something wrong with their situation, and I don't think that is what we want. Many people usually consider the main problem to be that all children need both their mother and their father both for love and to identify themselves with. Only, we know that there are many children who live with only one parent and not everyone identifies themselves with their parents or with their parents only. There may be a relative or a teacher the children look up to. I would say that what children need isn't necessarily one mother and one father, but they need love, care and security, and where they are given that, there is a good home. I don't think the question is if there ever will be a law that gives homosexuals the same right to adopt as heterosexuals, because there probably will. In Sweden, only two political parties have voted against the proposal, the Christian democrats and the conservatives. The question is when. Altogether, I think that until adoption is legal for homosexuals, people's attitude will not change. The sooner it becomes a law, the easier it will be for people to accept the whole concept. I must say I really am sure that children with homosexual adoptive parents will not have problems simply because of that unless other people think they should have. The problems only exist as long as people let them. Hence people must try to get rid of their prejudice and not concentrate on unnecessary problems. We should show that homosexuals and heterosexuals are equal!
EE001	1	﻿ English, my English! Assesing ones strengths and weaknesses in any situation is a hard task. Usually we are not so good at recognizing our strengths, instead we spend our time being critical of ourselves, thus we tend to present a much more detailed side of our flaws. I will try to give you a reasonable picture of my good and not quite as good sides, as I see them, in reference to the four skills that were mentioned in the guide-lines handed out earlier in regard of this essay. y biggest weakness by far is reading in English. I most of the time find it quite boring, it probably has to do with the fact that I'm a very outgoing person and therefore I like meeting people and I prefer to converse with them. A contributing factor to my feelings about reading also has to do with the fact that I'm just not used to it, which makes reading a bit uncomfortable. It takes time to read and it is not by far as fun as actually talking with someone. You miss out on facial expressions and the dialogue for example. It's not that I can't manage, I just don't find it all that amusing, at times. This leads too the fact that I more or less skim through anything written in English, which ultimately results in my misinterpretations. But I am indeed working on that partly since it is required in order to be able to teach but also for my own benefit. I have been known to read books in English on occasion though. Preferably novels taking place during the nineteenth century when in my personal opinion the English language was at its best. I think it's terrible that we've lost so much of the chivalry, the sence of class and style that one can encounter in for example Jane Austens' "Pride & Prejudice", or the vocabulary used in Shakespeares works. This brings us to the speaking, which I believe is one of my strongest features, not only when it comes to speaking English, but speaking in general. I admit that it sometimes does get out of hand. You see, in my previous English classes I've always been the one to speak my opinion and discuss things that are important to me. This might and actually has lead to the fact that others who are not as forward as I am just sit quiet and on top of that they're doing absolutely nothing to change or take any kind of initiative to speak. This annoyes me, should I keep holding back to suit them or should I allow myself the oportunity to improve and broaden my horizons!? In this class though it doesn't seem to be a thing that even needs to be discussed, since everybody is fairly good in English, and not at all shy. I do know how and when to use a very formal vocabulary, but I tend to disregard that at times when I get "too comfortable" with the person I'm addressing, it's not a lack of respect or anything of that nature, I just get too "buddy-ish". I think that speaking a lot helps me improve all the aspects of English, writing, reading, listening but most importantly to communicate in any given situation. My desire to communicate enables people in my everyday life to correct me when I'm wrong and vice versa. I believe there are two kinds of English students. The ones that learn the language by using grammar and dictionaries and school-English, not that there is anything wrong with that. In fact I think it's a good start, a solid base to begin at. And then the others, much like myself, who learn by actually speaking, conversing and therefore picking up a rich vocabulary. Both have advantages and disadvantages. I've learned my English by speaking, practising and perhaps mostely by listening to others. Listening is also one of my strengths. For this is where I learn and adapt. I like watching news, documentaries or whatever is on in English. If I'm lucky I might even catch one of David Attenboroughs' "wild-life-documentaries". He has an elegant vocabulary and intonation. Although I must say that if it were possible to choose I'd pick one of the people behind the series of "The young ones", preferably Rick Mayallik. But I'm not apposed to listening to sports either, as long as it is English. I've come to the last of the four skills, namely writing. I think I'm fairly good at that. It takes a lot of hard work though. When I took "Business English" last fall we got to do a lot of inquiries, and business-letters which I enjoyed very much. At times it is easier to write when you have a given assignment, than to just come up with an idea. This forces me to try not to drift away, as I have a tendency to do just that. I've never had an English pen pal, so I've never really written on a regular basis other than when I've been in school. My knowledge of gramatical terms is terrible which might be detected from time to time. Although I seem to be able to communicate without any larger difficulties. In conclusion: It seems I've got my work cut out for me for at least the next two years ahead. Hopefully I'll learn to master things and tackle my weak spots quickly. After that there are other challenges that need to be attended to.$$$﻿ In the name of Religion, you can get away with anything! With this argumentative piece I've tried to shed a light on the consequences of religion. What goes on, apart from all of the good deeds man does in the name of religion. I've devided them in five headings, all regarding different aspects of the topic. I myself am not a believer. I'm a naturally born critic or sceptic, if you will. I firmly believe that it should be up to every man/woman to inividually process information and facts that are given or thrown upon us. Just because something has been going on for a long period of time doesn't necessarily mean it's alright. 1) Religion is prohibiting. It compromises the person. Religion prevents individual thinking and persuades mankind to accept and "buy the whole concept" of its ideas in the scriptures. The scriptures compromise peoples prerogative to think for themselves, they roothlesly rob people of their natural ability to evaluate and act on their own intuition. Religion makes the individual fall in line and not to question anything it says. Is that a good thing, I ask? Is compromising yourself necessary, in the name of religion? 2) Religion causes conflicts. Lets look at religion in a passed-present-future perspective. I don't think I'm going out on a limb if I point out that more or less all wars, some excluded originates from religious grounds and believes. The discontent of people who don't agree with you or don't share your believes causes conflicts in the name of religion. 3) Religion prevents individual freedom. In the end of 1980, an Irish-catholic girl was brutaly raped and got pregnant. She suffered in agony for she wanted to have the foetus removed but her religion forbids abortion. Her case was globaly acknowledged in the media and many, myself included felt for her and witnessed the madness, in the name of religion. The bible, an ancient book of moral clauses and devises for a pure way of life, said she couldn't have an abortion. Luckely she could get help in England and have the abortion done there. Imagine if she hadn't, what life would that child have led!? 4) Religion discriminates. Sure, it unifies certain people who share the same ideology. On the other hand it condems different genres even within the same religion and thus the people who don't agree with them. People who don't share their point of view or religious believes. Is it righteous to commit cruel actions as long as it is in the name of religion? 5) Religious downpayment!? Even in the early days you were able to go to your church and seek repentance for your sins. You mearly went to a priest and confessed and he would gladly give it to you. He might suggest that you ought to do a few Hail Mary's and suddenly in an instance you had been forgiven. Back then you could even assure your place in heaven when buying a letter of indulgence. Buy your way into the Lords glory, heaven, kingdom or what ever you preferred. Today's version of that same phenomena is called Televangelism. The 80's way to repentance. Televised fundraisings, usually held by a spiritual leader of some kind. He would very convincingly encourage the viewers to support his "cause", by donating obnoxiously large sums of money to him and the "cause". The cause might be o an honest nature, to build evangelist churches or help the poor. But in some cases they were spend for personal gain by the so called prophet. Outrageous news of spiritual leaders spending their money on prostitutes and extramarital affairs. These people who are supposed to set an example to their followers. I guess their only human, but it can't feel all that to be good old Mrs Lewis in the south of California, who recently donated a large sum to "reverend Chastity", and learn that he has spent "her" money on questionable things, can it!? It's a strange world we live in where some people profits from other peoples misery. Conclusion: Imagine a world without prejudice of religion, race, colour or believes! Almost impossible to picture I know. Religion should be more humble and "human", it should serve as a medium that brings people together, not to discriminate. I'm not saying that it should be removed or terminated, because many people need to be able to put their trust in a supreme being. It needs to be altered/changed or modified, since everything else has been in order to fit in in today's society. Many vicious things have been done, is being done and will be done in the name of religion. It is not acceptable! TAKE ACTION!
EE458	1	﻿ Social allowance are not for people who can work In Sweden we have to many people who are living on social allowance and dont't need to do it. I belive that people who really need to have social allowance are going to have it, but it should be a much better check-up of who really needs it and who don't. Nobody in Sweden needs to be starving or don't have the opportunity to have anywhere to live. If we need to, we can get help from the social service. That is a good thing that we have that help because anybody could get in a situaion where they really needed help from the social service. Some people can't earn enogh money, or maybe not any money at all, to survive. For example single parents, people who who can't get a job or are not able to work for special reasons or having other sorts of problems. I belive that they are those who are going to get help from the social service in the first place. What I don't like is the fact that the social service in many cases don't check better who needs money and who is only using the system. There are for example a lot of young people who don't want to work and instead of trying to get a job, or maybe study, they go to the social service and get money. There are to many young people who are to lazy and are allowed to be lazy because nobody tells them that they have to do anything. They just make up a story that they have some sort of problem and the people who works for the social service belive them or don't care and give them social allowance. They can get social allowance and don't even need to apply for a job, they don't need to study or do anything they don't want to do. They can go around in the city and meet friends all day if they wants to or lay in the bed and do nothing. They don't have any physical or mental illnesses at all. I don't think that helps them in any way, that nobody cares if they do anything or not. In stead they get money for somewhere to live, for cloths, for food, for travelling expences and money to exercise. A single person without children get 2900 SEK/month. That is for food, cloths and bills. Then they can get more money for paying rent, homeinssurance etc. Often they still live at home with their parents or don't live anywhere, they just go around and stay with friends and don't have any big expences. In stead they by things that they don't really need and go out partying and just have a good time for the money. It's a lot of things the money they get could go to, like resourses for care of children or elder people or for school. I don't think that they would have a choise, they should have to get a job either they want it or not. And if they can't get a job where they earn enough money to live on they can get the rest from the social service, because then they are at least doing something for the society. They also get the oppertunity to up-keep their skills or learn new things. Often they don't even appriciate the money they get because they get them to easy, they know that they don't deserve the money. The people in Sweden who works pay a lot of taxees and some of those taxees is money who the social service get to give to people who really needs them. I don't think that the people who pays all these taxees like the fact that some people who are just to lazy to earn their own money live on others. I think it is terrible to see all these people who gets money from the social service when they can work to get it, and see other people who needs more money but can't get it, because some use the system in a wrong way. Social allowance is not supposed to be a permanent living.$$$﻿ Children watch too much violence on television There are too much violence on television and a lot of children are watching it. There is probably no really good solution from 'saving' children from violence on television but there are many ways of preventing them to see too much of it. There are mostly a responsibility for parents but also a responsibility for television corporations. First of all children should not watch as much TV as they do, there are a lot of things that are much better for them to do instead, things that are more creative. Television is probably not bad for children in a surten amount and if they watch programs that are suitable for them. It has to be a control of what they are watching. Parents have to take the main responsibility, that they know what their children are watching and don't let them watch everything they want, but there is also a responsibility for television corporations. Programmes with a lot of violence don't have to be sent early and there could be advisories that warn of excessive violence. That can at least help parents a bit. When the parents are at home they can go and have a look at what the children are watching. If the parents are at work and their children are not old enough to see everything on TV they maybe shouldn't be left at home alone. There is probably someone they could stay with, relatives, neighbours or friends with an adult at home. There are also often too many televisions in some houses. A lot of children have their own TV in their rooms and that makes it more difficult for parents to know what their children are watching. Parents could also talk with their children about the programmes, ask them what it was about. It's important that children talk about what they have seen, because if they have seen something that they maybe shouldn't have seen their parents can talk and explain what violence do to people and that everything on the television are not for real. One reason why a lot of children watch too much TV is probably because their parents don't have so much time for them. They should let them play with friends or make more of their own time for them. Everything is not as important than to do things that develop children. In an article in the TIME Magazine,(TELEVISION: Support grows for the V-ship as a way to protect young viewers, July 24, 1995), one suggestion of protecting children from violence on television is to have a TV with the V chip. That could be help for parents to control what their children are watching, or what their children are not going to watch. Even if it isn't a perfect solution it is at least a help. One of the problems with the V chip, as the article reveals, is that there are problems with the technology, the V chip wont be able to tell difference between violence of different kinds. If the V chip is going to be an alternative it has to be well thought-out so it is more help than problem to have it. Because there is not one good solution for protecting children from violence parents and society have to try to control what children are watching as far as it is possible. It has to be adult people who decide what's good and what's bad for children to watch and make shore that they don't see too much violence on TV.
EE005	0	﻿ PART-TIME FATHERS When a relationship has irretrievably broken down and separation is inevitable, the children are more often than not the real losers. Traditionally the child has always lived with the mother after the break-up of the parents. There is new trend emerging in Sweden, however, part-time fathers are becoming more common, that is, the child lives alternatively with his/her father/mother, for example, every second week. I have isolated three different causes that I think could have caused this. Firstly, the law reforms that have enabled fathers to play a bigger role in their children's lives. Secondly, the fathers seem to be more willing to take on more responsibility in raising their children. Thirdly, both parents seem to have become aware of the importance of the father's role in the children's lives. I have based my essay partly on my own views as well as newspaper articles from Dagens Nyheter and the book Sverige En Ekonomisk och Social Historia. In 1960s and 1970s marriage and especially de-facto relationships became more common than ever before. During the 1970s law reforms took affect which gave men and women equal opportunity to work and take care of their children. Sweden was unique in that it enabled fathers to go on paternity leave, although, not many of the men took the opportunity to stay at home and look after their children (Sverige p.159). In October of 1998 another law reform came into affect which gave the courts the right to grant shared custody and alternate living for the child, even if this went against the will of either partner (www.dn.se). The present day situation have changed, however, and with the 1998 law reform more parents have shared custody than they did before. The 1998 law reform has given fathers equal opportunity to actively take part in their children's every-day lives and they now have equal say in how to raise their children. The upbringing of a child was almost an exclusive right that the mothers had before, the father normally only spent time with his child on the week-end. This created an unrealistic picture in the child's mind of what a father should be like, he became someone that you only did fun things with. For many fathers being a "week-end-dad" is not enough and with the new reform they can now play an equally important role in their children's lives if they want to. Another development is that both parents are thinking of what is best for their children. There seem to be an increased awareness that a child need both parents for his/her psychological well-being. Some experts argue, however, that alternate living can be detrimental and that it can cause these children to feel that they do not have a permanent situation in their lives. A solution to this would be that the child has only one home, and the parents would be the ones having to move back and forth. According to children living in these situations, constant moving and packing of belongings seemed to be the most negative aspect with having two homes. They said that they otherwise felt satisfied and it had not affected them emotionally(www.dn.se). It seems that the children appear quite content with living alternately with their parents, and conclusively it does not seem that this type arrangement would be harmful for the children. Shared custody seems to be a good solution to a difficult situation, it is an advantage if a child maintains a healthy relationship with either parent. The negative aspect, however, is as I said before that we all need a stable situation. Ideally would (of course) be if the family was one unit, But when this is not possible the model of alternative living seems to be a good solution, and it is apparent that these parents are acting in the best interest of their children.$$$﻿ "Taboo or Not Taboo" In the article "Cleaning up the language" by Shirley E Peckham, the author takes a clear stand on children who use swear words in their language. She has a very conservative view of language and wants it to be like "in the good old days" when she was a child. What she does not realise is that language is changing all the time; if it does not change it is dead. The part that seems to disturb her the most is that she becomes "filled with disgust" when she hears children use bad language. Furthermore, she is worried that allowing this kind of words will lead to bad language used by everybody in the future. She has strong opinions on the use of language but nevertheless she does not have any suggestions on how this matter should be solved. One way for Peckham to solve this matter and make her feel better would perhaps be to try to talk with the children involved. Unfortunately, it seems like she is of the opinion that children are as disgusting as swear words so I doubt she will ever confront them. My experience though, is that it is often a good idea to talk to children about different problems that occur. If you talk to them on an appropriate level and do not patronize them you have at least a possibility to change a negative pattern. To use the method that Peckham is suggesting as solution, namely to box a child around his or her ears, is what I would call disgusting. Peckham has been raised in this manner and perhaps it is the only way she knows to demand respect and to make someone listen to her. But to my mind abusing a child by threatening or hitting him or her is not a very constructive or educational way of learning. I do believe that children learn better if they are secure and not scared of the people around them. In her article Peckham also refers to this language as "foul anti-social". I would say that she has misinterpreted the situation completely. On the contrary, the language between children in a group is definitely a very social phenomenon. By using a certain kind of language it is possible for them to identify themselves with the rest of the group and this is of great importance while growing up. In addition I am convinced that most children have the judgement not to use bad language when it is not suitable, for example when they talk to older relatives. In contrast to Peckham, I do believe in children's ability to adjust to different situations. This above-mentioned ability is also the answer to the author's fear of swear words becoming general practice in the future. Perhaps is it also a question of maturity. This kind of words may be common in children's language but when they grow up these words usually reduce in number or at least they are not used in public so frequently. Even Mrs Peckham admits that she swore when she was a child, even if she does it reluctantly. For her it seems to be a question about swear words being taboo or not taboo and maybe the reason to this is the way she was treated as a child when she swore. To sum up I would like to say that it is not so difficult for me to accept children that swear or the words in themselves. But to Mrs Peckham and the likes of her I cannot emphasise enough the importance of verbal communication to solve a matter instead of using violence. Communication will lead to children feeling safe and is not that what we all want?
EE004	1	﻿ English as a world language 1. Introduction My intention is to describe the importance of English and give a brief account of its history and how it has spread all over the world. I will begin with defining what a world language is and then I will describe the way English has reached the position it has today. I will continue with some up-to-date statistics and then mention some different varieties of English and explain the terms Pidgins and Creoles. I find it important to investigate how it is possible for a language spoken by so few at the beginning to become a world language which is quite familiar to so many people. My sources are secondary, since it is difficult to find good primary sources on this subject. 2. Definition of a world language What is a world language? According to the Swedish Encyclopaedia Nationalencyklopedin (1996) it is a language which is spoken or understood by a considerable number of people around the globe. Thus languages such as Chinese (Mandarin), English and Arabic are world languages, but not Swedish or artificial languages such as Esperanto. To a large extent the position of a language as a world language depends on the literature (books, papers and scientific works) that is written in that language. English meets with these criteria and is the dominating world language of today. Seen from a historical point of view otherlanguages have occupied the position as world languages; in the 17th and 18th centuries French was the dominating language. Before that Latin and Greek dominated in the medieval and ancient Europe. 3. The spread of English At the beginning English was not a widely spread language. In Shakespeare's time the number of people speaking English was as low as a few millions. As the population grew the number of English speakers did as well. English gradually became the main language of Wales, Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. When the English commenced to explore the wide world outside the British Isles the first step on the way to English becoming a world language had been taken. The English began to colonise other continents in the 17th and 18th centuries. The British settlers spoke English, but there were many settlements in the New World from other nations, and they all spoke their native tongue. For a very long time English, Spanish, French and Dutch colonisers fought for the dominance of the Caribbean and by the early 19th century Britain had control of a number of the West Indian islands. This resulted in English becoming the most spoken language of the area. The English also took control over the Indian subcontinent and a few years later the British colonisation of Australia took place. British rule was established in Singapore, British Guiana, New Zealand and Hong Kong and later on also in parts of West Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa (Barber 1993:234-5). The English dominance is mainly due to political and economical reasons, e.g. the strength of the British Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries. After World War two the position of the US became increasingly more powerful as regards political, economical, technical, scientific and generally cultural areas. 4. Statistics English is used in over 70 countries as an official or semi-official language. According to Stora Focus (1987) the largest English speaking populations are found in the US (230 million), the UK (56 million), Canada (17 million), Australia (15 million), New Zealand (3 million), Ireland (3 million) South Africa (2 million) and Jamaica (2 million). English is the official language in all these countries and has an official status in over 50 more countries with approximately one milliard inhabitants in all. The largest of these are India, Pakistan and the Philippines. As a first language English is spoken by more than 400 million people all over the world of today. Another 350 million use it regularly as a second language. A further 100 million speak it more or less fluently as a foreign language and of the estimated 40 million users of the Internet the majority communicate in English. Since the middle of the 20th century English is the language that is most frequently taught at school in most countries all over the world. Its central position in the international communication is due to the fact that the majority of all scientific publications printed in the world are in English. For example 2/3 of the medical journals published in 1985 were in English. The main language of books, newspapers, airports and air-traffic control, international business and academic conferences, technology, diplomacy, sport, international competitions, pop music and advertising is English. 5. Varieties "Although English has become an international language, it lacks any independent standard codification or description that adequately reflects its international character," says Samuel Ahulu in his article "General English" (1997). There are nowadays many varieties of English and to discuss them in detail is far too complex to deal with here. Some of the varieties are; British English (abbreviated RP; Received Pronunciation), American English (AE) and Canadian English as well as Australian, New Zealand, South African, and West Indian English. These varieties differ as regards pronunciation, stress, intonation and vocabulary. 6. Pidgins and Creoles There are probably well over two hundred Pidgin- and Creole-languages in the world today, and they are based on many different languages such as French, Portuguese and Zulu but the largest number is based on English. Between six and twelve million people are still using Pidgin languages and between ten and seventeen million are using languages descending from Pidgins, so called Creoles. A Pidgin is an auxiliary language used mainly by people trading with each other when they have no common language. The word Pidgin is thought to be from a Chinese Pidgin version of the English word business. You might say that the Pidgin is a simplified form of the dominant language. The grammatical morphology is simple and the vocabulary is limited. Maybe the most known Pidgin is the one of Papua New Guinea, called Tok Pisin, which even is acknowledged in the country's constitution, although it nowadays more accurately should be described as a Creole. When a Pidgin develops beyond its role as a trade language and becomes the first language of a social community, it is called a Creole. There is, however, no sharp distinction between a Pidgin and a Creole. (Yule 1996, Barber 1993) 7. Conclusion It is most likely that English will continue to keep its position as a world language also in the future. No other language shows any signs of threatening English as the leading language. Especially as regards the IT-market, which is the most important field of exploration and development in the future, English is the dominating language of communication. This is due to the fact that the US is the leading state on the market. It is extremely advantageous that there is such a language as English by which you are able to communicate all over the world. English is in truth a world language.$$$﻿ The Decline of the Birth-rate in Sweden A negative trend that can be observed in the Swedish society of today is the decline of the birth-rate. In 1990 the number of children born in Sweden was 120 000, in 1994 it was 110 000 and in 1998 it was as low as 89 000. The number of deceased persons was 95 000, 92 000 and 93 000 respectively - in other words, there is an excess of deaths over births. At the same time the total population of Sweden increased from 8,6 million people in 1990 to 8,8 million in 1994 and to 8,9 million in 1998. These statistics, which I have obtained from the homepage of the SCB, illuminate this trend very clearly. But what are the reasons for this phenomenon? The main cause of the low birth-rate is the economic situation. It is simply too expensive for many people to bring up children in our society. Therefore family planning has become usual. The possibility to avoid unwanted pregnancies through preventives or the alternative to go through a legal abortion has of course had a very great impact on the birth-rates. The child allowance far from cover the loss of income during pregnancy, maternity leave and all other expenses involved when raising a child. Many couples decide to become parents later in life after having obtained a good job and earned some money and paid off their debts. Sometimes the decision is made too late and others never reach the point in life when they decide that the time to bring children into the world has come. Furthermore, women's position in society has gone through a radical change. Formerly a woman was expected to give birth to children and take care of the household. These were her major tasks in life. Nowadays women have the opportunity of achieving the same positions in business and professional life as men. Consequently, this has influenced the female way of life. After compulsory school an increasing number of young men and women continue their studies, at university for example. The studies often take many years to complete and giving birth to a child during that time is not what most women desire. After the studies quite a few women want to make a carrier and when they intend to climb the ladder of success children are not considered convenient. Thus women neither have the time nor want to raise children. It has now become more socially accepted than earlier to have a carrier instead of choosing ordinary family-life if you cannot combine them. What may the effects of this decline of the birth-rate be? The most terrifying aspect is that it makes the economy of the country weak. This may need some further explanation. The number of people above the age of 60 was in 1990 18% of the total population in the OECD-countries (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) and statisticians have reached the conclusion that the number will be 30% in 2030. In other words, the number of retired people will increase and thus the state-budgets will have to be used to take care of old people instead of the younger generation. This will lead to reduced contributions as regards education and the consequence will be a deteriorated school-system. The result will be a generation of people without sufficient education. Swedish know-how will decrease and thus weaken the Swedish economy. Also other contributions, for instance means for the infrastructure and the military, will diminish and the country will slowly begin to decay. Nevertheless, the troublesome problem with unemployment will fade away when the workers of today retire and their professional posts must be filled. Provided that the school-system still is satisfactory the young people will have no difficulty in finding jobs. This will, hopefully, lead to a rapid development in society and Sweden will catch up with what was lost during the time of "depression". In the long run this decreasing rate of nativity might be very healthy for the economy of the country, but the change should take place at a slower pace than it does at the moment. Attempts have been made from the government to encourage people to have more children. In conclusion this trend of decline of the birth-rate is due to the difficult economic situation of the last years. Lately signs indicate that the economic situation is improving and if this is the case, the birth-rate most certainly will improve. The fact that women make carriers probably does not influence the birth-rate as much as the economic situation does.
EE241	1	﻿ The Fifth Child a story of a perfect life falling apart A perfect life, is not that what we all want? But is it possible to control everything that happens in it. Even though we try to control everything that happens around us, most things are out of our control. We can try to create the perfect life, but we are never safe from bad or evil things happening in it. The main characters of this story turn against their families and the values of the time they live in, to create what they think is the perfect life, but something happens that destroys their idyllic world. In this essay I am going to look at the main theme in Doris Lessing's "The Fifth Child", and discuss the importance of setting for this theme. This story can be seen as the story of a mother's love, or about guilt, but the most outstanding theme is the sudden change. The change that can turn the life of a family up side down, and destroy the idyllic life they have created for themselves. The main characters, the young couple Harriet and David, are determined to build the life and family they want. They go against their families and the society around them to do what they think is the right thing. When reading this book, one feels that something must happen to break this perfect idyllic life, and this something is the birth of their fifth child. This changes everything. Their perfect family falls apart. Their relatives and friends pull away, and their own children are afraid of this vicious new baby. The child is different, evil and violent, and suddenly a big part of their life is socially unacceptable. Their own child is unacceptable, and even Harriet and David can make themselves love him. Because this is a story about suddenly not fitting in, the setting is of big importance. The different settings that are relevant for this story are the time in history the story takes place, the scenery, and the moral, social and emotional conditions that surrounds the characters of the story. The time in history is the late 1960's. The atmosphere in England at this time, is unconstrained and the idea of a big family is regarded as old-fashioned. Fewer women want to stay at home with their children and divorces are much more common than they used to be. This also shows in the social, moral, and emotional conditions that surround the main characters, and which is connected to the time. Harriet and David goes against their families and the values of the society they live in to create a perfect family and a perfect life. Harriet comes from a "real family" with a mother who stayed home with the children. Getting married and having children has always been the obvious choise for Harriet. Harriet's mother is not at all as happy about the idea as Harriet. She knows what hard work is involved in this. David's parents are divorced and he grew up with two families, of whom neither worked very well. He wants his family to be a perfect one, with a loving wife and a lot of happy children. His family is as much against the idea as Harriet's mother. But nothing they say can stop the young couple. Harriet and David turns against the "greedy and selfish" (29) spirit of the times with their version of a normal, traditional family. The next important part of the setting is the scenery, in this book a big old Victorian house in a quiet neighbourhood outside London, that Harriet and David buys to create the perfect life in. The door is always open for friends and relatives and the house is filled with warmth and kindness. In the book Harriet and David think of their house as "their fortress, their kingdom" (30). The house becomes something of a retreat and people look forward to spending their holidays there. Harriet and David are convinced that this perfect life and home is something they deserve. They shut the rest of the world out, and even though they hear about things happening in the world outside, this is something that really does not concern them. The use of a quiet little town and an old Victorian house with its many warm family gatherings to describe the idyll before the dramatic change in their lives, is very effective. As we have seen the setting is of big importance for the main theme of this book. It is important for us to know what is "the normal" thing to do at this time, and why Harriet's and David's idea of the perfect family is regarded as strange. It is also important to know what kind of moral and social conditions that surround them and their families, because from this we can understand the way they behave. Finally, the choise of scenery, the small town and the big old Victorian house, are effective to describe the idyll that is dramatically changed into a nightmare.$$$﻿ Evaluation English, my English! So now I'm supposed to wright about my skills in English. One thing I can say is that I wish I was better. It's not that I'm terrible at it, but sometimes I just can't find the right words. I want to be able to use English just as easy as I use Swedish. I guess it depends on how much I use it, how much practice I get. When I was 17, I went to Hastings in England for four weeks of English studies, and my English has never been better than when I came home to Sweden again. Me and a friend stayed with mr and mrs Lewis and their baby Sarah, and mrs Lewis talked uninterruptedly from the moment we arrived. She asked all sorts of questions about everything, but I guess that was a good thing, because otherwise I might have been too afraid to speek at all. After a week I wasn't afraid to speak at all and when it was time to go home, it felt like I was born English. Anyway, that was a long time ago and I haven't been speaking much English since then. This means that I must have it all somewhere in my head. It's just that I don't know where. Hopefully I will find at least some of it during this semester. Listening This is something I find quite easy. English isn't at all hard to understand, unless the one who's speaking is from Scotland or something. It doesn't matter if there's one or two words I don't understant, because I usually understand the rest of it. I hear English everywhere around me. I hear it in music, on the television and when I go to the movies. I also like listening to recorded books and the ones in Swedish are really boring, so I go for the English ones. I guess that is good practice. It's nice to have lectures in English and find that I actually understand everything the teacher is saying. Reading y skills in reading are probably the same as in listening. In short I can say that I understand most of what i read. I really like books and if they are written by an English or an American author, I prefer to read them in the original language. Once in a while a word that I don't recognice pops up, and sometimes I look it up. But if I understand the context, than I almost always understand the word without having to look it up. I find reading and listening easyer than speaking and writing, and I guess that's because I can take my time and think, and I don't have to be afraid to do something wrong. Nobody will care if there's a word or two that I don't understand in a text or during a lecture, but if I say or wright something incorrect, everybody will notice it. Speaking The reason I find it difficult to speak English, especially if the one I'm speaking to is from an English speaking country, is that I'm afraid to say something wrong that will make me look stupid. I have a cousin in Ireland and he told me once that he had almost no English at all in school, and that my English probably was better than his so I guess I don't have that much to worry about, but sometimes it's so hard to find the right words. If I talk som someone out in a pub or in one of the nations, and if I've had a beer or two, than my English is great, but in the classroom, I just sound stupid. That's something I don't like at all, and I hope all the speaking in school will help me with this. Writing Now this is the tricky part. I can't remember half of what I learned about Swedish grammar, so how am I supposed to know about transitive verbs, complements and subordinate clauses? It's so easy to wright in Swedish, but when I do it in English I have to think about everything. I can think of something I really want to wright, and then i have to wright it in some other way because I don't know how to formulate it. This is really very frustrating. I guess practice is the medicine for this too. Finally I really like English and want to learn how to use it, without having to think and worry about everything I say. I guess it would be an exaggeration to say that my English is bad, but it could be a lot better, and I hope this semester of English studies will help me on the way.
EE240	0	﻿ Is English a Germanic or Romance Language? Introduction English holds a very special position in the Indo-European language family, being in part Germanic, in part Romance. Traditionally, it has been regarded as Germanic, due to its origin, but there are linguists who maintain that the number of French and Latin loanwords in English make it more Romance than Germanic. In this essay, I will analyse the statements put forth by professor Jean-Marc Gachelin at the University of Rouen, France, in his article 'Is English a Romance Language?', published in English Today in July 1990. Looking more closely at the complex history of English, I will also reflect upon what manner of words originate from Latin and French, what remain Germanic and why the division was maintained throughout the centuries. For this I will consult three works dealing with the linguistic history of the British Isles; Barber, C. The English Language. A Historical Introduction (1993:88-174); Baugh, A.C. and Cable, T. A History of the English Language (1993:105-153); Williams, J.M. Origins of the English Language (1975:52-90). I will not use any primary sources. A brief look at the history of English To a great extent, the English tongue was forged by the various invasions that befell the island kingdom, as the languages of invaders and natives mixed and blended through daily contact. The first of these invasions was that of the Germanic peoples, i.e. the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, which occurred around 450 AD. These tribes spoke West Germanic (Williams 1975:52), which in time would evolve into what we call Old English (OE). This language was to form most of the stem (i.e. basic vocabulary and pronouns and other non-lexical words) of modern English. Some four hundred years later, another Germanic-speaking race appeared on the scene: the Danes. These Viking raiders settled on the east coast of England and formed their own community, the so-called Danelaw, 'in which the Danes were free to live as Danes under Danish law' (Williams p. 59). Apart from strengthening the already present Germanic vocabulary, the Danes introduced Scandinavian loanwords into English. Among these we find words to do with trading, (scales, egg, gift), kinship (sister, husband) and the pronouns they, their and them. The next great invasion, that of the Normans, could also be said to be of Scandinavian origin, since the Normans' ancestors were Vikings having settled in the fertile lands of western France. However, over time the inhabitants of Normandy (cf. Swedish Nordman 'man from the North) forgot their northern language and adopted the tongue of the natives, Old French, and it was this language that they brought with them to England in the eleventh century. The linguistic impact that the Normans had on English was immense. For centuries Norman French was the language of nobility and royalty as well as of the courts. As a consequence, middle-class families who hoped to improve their status, had their children learn French as well as Latin, the two languages of the learned. This trend lingered on. In fact, it was not until the reign of Henry IV (1399-1413) that English start appearing regularly in royal documents anew. However, one must not forget that English remained the language of the populace during this time, or that several major works (among them Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales) were written in English. This period brought with it a huge influx of words, among them words for nobility (prince, duke, count), religion (sermon, sacrament, virgin), food (fruit, mutton, stew), warfare (army, battle, peace) and the arts (music, beauty, colour). The use of French in England declined mainly as a consequence of two things (Williams p. 83): the loss of Normandy to France in 1204, which forced the English nobility with estates in both countries to chose nationality once and for all; and the Black Death in 1348, which killed approximately 30 percent of the English population (Baugh & Cable, p.139), forcing laymen who only spoke English into clerical positions. To these causes can be added a third: the nationalistic feelings that arose due to the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) between England and France. Throughout history, the language of the enemy has seldom been well liked, and it is quite likely that kings and nobles started addressing the populace in their own language to gain in popularity. But a vast amount of French loan-words had already permeated English, and in spite of some purists' attempts to purge the language, the French element was there to stay. Another great influence in English, as well as in all other languages in the Christian world, has been Latin. Ever since England was Christianised (597 AD onwards), religious words such as alms, heretic and monastery have trickled in. Later on scientific terms and more 'learned' words were taken from Latin, adding greatly to the gargantuan English vocabulary. Is English a Romance language? I will now have a look at the views put forth by Professor Gachelin in the aforementioned paper. I wish to make it clear at this point that the Professor does not take a definite stand in this matter, but merely states some reasons why English could be regarded as belonging to the Romance languages. One of the foremost factors in this issue, is of course the great number of Romance words that exists in English. Gachelin states that "English is more than half Latin in its vocabulary". However, the English vocabulary is enormous, due to the great amount of 'doubles' that exist-Romance words with a Germanic counterpart, e.g. lovely and amiable. In everyday life, a mere fraction of these words are used. Do the Latin words make up half of this quotidian (or daily) vocabulary as well? The Romance part of the vocabulary has, historically speaking, always belonged to the gentry, a division still visible today, albeit to a lesser degree. For although a great many words have found their way into everyday speech (such as exist, garden and, for that matter, language), many remain aloft and formal, often replaced by a more common synonym, be it Germanic or Romance, in informal situations (inquietude, 'anxiety', inebriated, 'drunk', sedulous, 'hardworking'). So can we really claim that English is Romance simply because more than half of its vocabulary stems from Latin, sometimes via French? Do we not have to take into account the frequency with which the words occur? I think that we do. The situation which we are in also plays a very important part in our choice of words. As has been the case since the Norman invasion (see above), Romance words carry a formality which Germanic words lack. We are also more likely to see a person as learned, and thus authoritative, if he uses delinquent in stead of criminal. Gachelin acknowledges this fact when he says that "[t]he sociolinguistic prestige of Latinate English is noteworthy". But although the Romance words in today's English are both numerous and regarded as prestigious, there is no denying the fact that the core of the tongue remains Germanic (Barber p. 62). All the pronouns (my, his, they) are of Germanic origin, as are the conjunctions (and, or, but). Not to mention all the everyday words, such as window, grass, tree, man, leg and book, or verbs, including take, be, run, swim and eat. Gachelin, too, says that English is "still basically Germanic" and later states: "It is easy to replace three of the five French words in the Lord's Prayer by Saxon equivalents (...) but it would be impossible to find Romance equivalents for all the Germanic words contained in this prayer." In English the Romance and Germanic influences blend very smoothly, and this is nowhere as apparent as in the formation of derivatives, which Prof. Gachelin says "is itself hybrid". A Romance stem can easily be fitted with a number of Germanic affixes, as in unquestioning, and the process works in reverse as well, Gachelin giving the examples delouse and debug. Conclusion As we have seen, Romance and Germanic words combine to form the English language as we know it. A once purely Germanic language has had a vast number of its words replaced by Romance counterparts, which in turn have to rely on Germanic words to bind them together. In short, English is neither wholly Germanic nor wholly Romance, but both in part. I think it is time to acknowledge it as the hybrid language it is instead of insisting that it fit into our carefully laid language models. As I stated in the first paragraph above, English holds a very special place among the Indo-European languages and in my opinion, that should be confirmed by linguists world-wide. On basis of the material available to me, as well as the limited amount of both time and space, I have not been able to delve fully into this subject and my conclusion should be seen in light of this. I recommend further study, not only on which language group has influenced the greatest number of English words, but also the frequency with which these words are used by the English-speaking peoples, as well as the situations in which they occur.

After having taken a closer look at a modest number among the multitudes of them, I have selected a few examples of words, in order to illustrate some aspects of the complex phenomenon of words carrying similar meanings. The words I will bring up are exclusively lexical, and when it comes to geographical differences, I have concentrated somewhat on the American versus the British vocabulary. For each group of synonyms, I will mention what is valuable to know about the differences of the individual words. In some cases, the answer will lie in their emotional connotation. In other cases, the difference might have to do with the strength or degree of their meaning. After discussing the established synonyms, I will devote one paragraph to comment on the development of "new" synonyms. Eventually, a discussion will be presented on the question whether or not synonyms, in the strictest sense of the word, actually exist. The purpose of this essay is to illustrate the aspects in which synonyms differ, along with trying to give account for the reasons for this difference - however small. Hopefully, through the specific examples and the discussion that follows, the reader will gain a deeper understanding of the complexity and use of English synonyms in general. 2. PREVIOUS RESEARCH In Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, one of my main secondary sources, a synonym is defined as "A word with the same meaning or nearly the same meaning as another word in the same language, such as 'sad' and 'unhappy'". It is obvious that the areas of semantics and synonyms for a long time have undergone considerable explorations and studies. Apart from the one mentioned above, the main secondary sources of previous research that I have been using are Engelska Synonymboken along with The Oxford Dictionary, and Nordstedts Stora Svensk-Engelska Ordbok. When searching for illustrative and typical examples of synonyms to present in this essay, I have been using Engelska Synonymboken almost exclusively, the one and only exception being my very last controversial synonym-pair, which was found in The English Language A Historical Introduction (Barber, 1999). 3. MATERIAL AND METHOD Because of the very nature of my topic, along with my insufficient knowledge of the English language, I have, to a large extent, relied on secondary sources. Yet, although the actual facts are found in previous research, I have myself run a check-up using the corpus of the English Department at Uppsala University, as an attempt to verify the relevance and accuracy of what the secondary sources state. 4. PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS Try - attempt - endeavour - strive All four possible translations that I am about to deal with, Rende (1990) classifies as synonyms. Yet, as for the use of try, attempt, endeavour and strive, there is a gradual difference between them, going from spoken to literal language. 'Try' is the most frequent word, most commonly used in spoken language, while 'attempt' is more formal and also stronger in meaning. Furthermore, 'endeavour' brings us to an even higher level of formality. Also, 'endeavour' is often used in ceremonial, solemn contexts, typically in written communication. In addition, 'endeavour' is mostly used when expressing a serious attempt to reach an honourable goal. To give an example, you may endeavour to raise money for charity. The word among the four synonyms mentioned above that has the strongest linking to written language, is 'strive'. This word is even more formal than the others, and it is to an even greater extent used in ceremonial or solemn situations. To 'strive' is to do your utmost to achieve something, fighting hard to make it come true. In conclusion, 'try', 'attempt', 'endeavour', and 'strive' represent a scale of increasing degree of formal meaning, which is a very common phenomenon among synonyms. Paternal - fatherly Another common aspect of difference between synonyms, is their emotional connotation. As for the words mentioned above, 'fatherly' is an emotionally charged word, while 'paternal' is considered neutral. Within the word 'fatherly' lie the associations of a loving father, while 'paternal' simply states a relationship, as a matter-of-fact (Rende 1990). This is a typical case; the native word usually involves an emotional charge to a much larger extent compared to its lent equal. Childish - childlike Looking up 'barnslig' in a Swedish-English dictionary, you will find numerous possible alternatives. Two of them are 'childish' and 'childlike', (Petti 1997). What is interesting about these synonyms is that the former carries a negative sense, while the latter is more positive. The former is considered a shortcoming while the latter is a desirable personal quality. For a Swede, whose mother tongue supplies only one possible word to describe this characteristic, this is a vital aspect to know about its two English correspondences, in order to avoid misunderstanding. Imagine telling your English friend she is childish, in the belief that you are paying a compliment! Daft - dumb A fourth way in which synonyms may differ, is the geographical area where they are used. In Britain, a silly person could be called 'daft', while in the United States, the same person probably would be labelled 'dumb'. The examples of this phenomenon are many, and a large number of them are a direct result of the colonisation of America back in the 16th century. As the new English-speaking society grew increasingly independent, so did its vocabulary. It is therefor quite logical that many of the geographically restricted synonyms express relatively modern concepts, such as the British 'motorway' versus the American 'freeway', although they also include many names describing topographical features specific for the different continents or habitats (Barber 1999). Still, similar to the group involving 'try', this group represents a scale - this time increasing in strength (Rende 1990). To have a 'scare' usually does not imply experiencing a trauma, but more likely a sudden fright, quick to approach, and quick pass by. The second alternative, 'fear', is the most common, widely used word, which can express everything from a light worrying to an overwhelming fear. Yet, since 'fear' is frequent in everyday speech, this particular word sometimes does not seem strong enough to depict to your listeners the intensity or depth of your unpleasant feeling. When that is the case, the third word in our group of synonyms comes in handy. 'Dread' is stronger than the words mentioned so far, commonly used in the context of fearing something inevitable and evil. Still, there is one even stronger word, namely 'terror'. Legalistic - legal? One last aspect of the phenomenon of synonyms that I would like to bring up, is represented in the two words mentioned above, 'legalistic' and 'legal'. Now, hopefully, your puzzled mind was eased somewhat by the question mark that followed this particular word- pair. Barber's point of mentioning this particular example, is illustrating that due to the flux of language new synonyms are about to be created. As for today, the definition of a 'legal' person is simply someone who stays within the frames of the law, staying away from illegal actions. A 'legalistic' person, on the other hand, is someone who is fundamentally devoted to rules and regulations in general, probably by choice. Consequently, these words are at present quite different in meaning. Yet, as a result of people's confusion of the 'correct' definition or usage of these two words, their meanings may gradually approach each other. As Barber states, perhaps one day they will become established synonyms. Do synonyms exist? After having been taking a deeper look into the concept of synonyms, I ask myself the question of whether words of identical meaning actually exist. Off course, the ones I have concentrated on have all been lexical words, and they do not make a huge number, but still, the question remains. From the examples above, there always seems to be some sort of difference between synonyms, however small it may be. Still, even if people in general probably consider a synonym as a being a word with the exact same meaning as another word, this is not quite the fact. With the correct definition of what a synonym is - a word with the same meaning or nearly the same meaning as another word - the examples I have studied would certainly qualify as synonyms, after all. It is useful to keep in mind, though, that your choice of synonym in almost all contexts is vital for what the actual meaning of the message you are about to bring across. 5. CONCLUSION To conclude, there are many factors contributing to the meaning of a word, and all of them provide different possibilities of ways in which synonyms may differ. For many synonyms, one is more common in written language while the other is more commonly used spoken. Another way in which synonyms may differ is through having an emotional connotation versus being considered neutral. Still one aspect of the meanings of similar words is a latent positive or negative association. Also, different synonyms often have different geographical areas of frequency, the most obvious one being the American and the British differences in vocabulary. An aspect in which synonyms very commonly differ, is that of the strength or degree of their meanings. More formal and rare words seem to be considered 'stronger' than those of everyday use. y second last conclusion concerning English synonyms is that they are still developing, out of words that initially carried considerably different meanings. As for the question of the existence of true synonyms, I must admit that this particular question is indeed valid, and the answer is not too evident. Still, even though the examples I have studied differ in many ways, the meanings are still close enough to justify the individual words being classified as being synonyms. 6.
EE243	1	﻿ A School System in Need of Changes The Swedish school system is not working. It took some time before the Swedish politicians realised that fact, or rather, before they wanted to admit it. Recent figures show that twenty percent of all 16-year-olds have difficulties reading or writing a simple peace of text. Of course something is wrong, and of course something has to be done. The Swedish political party Folkpartiet presents a few measures that could help the school system getting back on its right course again. One is to increase the time pupils devote to school work, another is to give marks earlier and compulsory national exams in order to detect which pupils need more help. These suggestions, I believe, are very good ones and should be actualised as soon as possible. By the example mentioned above, one can see that many pupils in the Swedish school need more help than they receive today. Folkpartiet points out that, as it is now, there is no time for the teachers to give that help. Swedish children have the shortest school day of all children in the industrialised countries, and more free days in a year than pupils in any other country. Besides, they have only nine years of compulsory school, from seven years of age to sixteen. So what can be done about this problem? The most natural thing to do would be to make the schooldays longer of course, but Folkpartiet does not stop at that. They also want to make the compulsory school one year longer, ten years instead of nine. The most important suggestions in my eyes are to give extra tutoring to pupils who need it, after class, and more homework to all pupils. This will make the school day even longer, in that sense that more time will be devoted to school work. Those who have problems with homework should be given the opportunity to do them at school with the help of a tutor. These are excellent suggestions; I would really like to see them in action right away. But if pupils will work more in school, so will teachers. And their burden is already heavy as it is. To make this suggestion work, schools must employ more teachers so there will be a tutor for every pupil who needs one. One of the reasons why pupils do not learn as much as needed is the fact that there is not enough teachers. And schools do not employ more teachers because they cannot afford it. So the question is how this could be done economically. To prevent the problem with 16-year-olds who cannot read or write, we have to detect the weak pupils at an early stage, in order to help them. As it is now, Swedish pupils get marks from the 8th year and forward. The former national exams which were compulsory and were taken by all Swedish pupils at the same time, have become voluntary. This means that it is hard to evaluate a specific pupil's knowledge and skill compared to other Swedish pupils. Folkpartiet claims that giving marks in the 8th year is too late. If a pupil receives very low marks, this should be considered as a signal that he/she needs more help. But by that time, it will be hard to help a pupil with low marks to keep up with the other pupils. It will be devastating for him or her to always be behind. For that reasons, they suggest that marks should be given from the 5th year. Folkpartiet also wants the national exams to be compulsory again, in order to evaluate how much the pupils have learned during a certain period compared to other children throughout the country. This exam should also be taken from the 5th year and forward. I believe that these changes would really make a difference, not only because we could detect the weak students earlier, but also because I think that more children would take school seriously if they were evaluated and "rewarded" for their efforts. Something that Folkpartiet discusses, and in which I agree, is that the Swedish school does not make demands upon the pupils. If nobody makes any demands upon you in school, you will probably not perform very well. As the situation is now in Swedish schools, teachers really have to make demands; there is much bullying and bad behaviour amongst pupils. If we could help them focus on the schoolwork, by making demands in the form of marks and national exams, maybe they would stop taking school for a big playground. I have described the Swedish school system as a complete failure, and sadly enough, I believe it is. Changes have to be made, and the suggestions put forward by Folkpartiet are at least worth consideration. If we could make the Swedish pupils believe in themselves, by giving them opportunities to catch up if they are behind, and give them marks to reward them at an early stage, it would really improve both the quality and quantity of their education. The question about money to employ more teachers remains; Folkpartiet has no answer to that. After all, they are politicians! Great hopes, but no real action.$$$﻿ Taboo or Not Taboo Shirley E. Peckham argues in her article "Cleaning up the language" that children of today are using swear words too much in their every-day conversations with each other. She is alarmed by this discovery since her own upbringing taught her that this is bad behaviour. She says that "If children are to be allowed to continue this foul and anti-social behaviour way for much longer it will become general practice for all and everyone in future years to behave in like way." I disagree with her; I really do not believe that our language is in any danger of becoming ruined by a frequent use of swear words. People have been swearing throughout time and that has not made our present language any worse. I am not concerned with children's swearing, I think that most children know when it is all right to use swear words and when it is not. Peckham claims, as mentioned, that if children are allowed to swear, our language will in the future be ruined and swearing will become general practice. This cannot be true, since swearing is an old phenomenon and people of today use good language. Peckham does not seem to understand that swear words have a specific function in our society; people use them to show emotion and in some cases to state their identity. If a particular swear word is used frequently by a large group of people, the word will after some time lose most of its former "power". If that happens a new swear word will be created; taken from an area in society which is taboo. So there will always be swear words and people who use them. Just because swear words are indeed forbidden, some young people like to use them. Peckham believes that children swear in order to feel big by it. But children and adolescent swear as a sort of revolt. "To revolt" is something most of us do at that age, and this kind of revolt has to be considered as quite harmless. Peckham also says that "children these days do not seem to know what speaking normally and decently is". I believe they do. As mentioned, swearing has a communicative function as well. When children and adolescents talk, they like to "spice" their language with different sorts of effects, to really clarify the emotional content of what they are saying. This kind of talk is often used among peers, not when a child is addressing a parent, a teacher, or any other adult. Nor does a child use swear words in their written texts in school, because he or she realises that swear words do not fit in in that context. Peckham had over-heard a conversation between young boys at the railway station, she had not talked to any of them herself, nor did any of the boys address her when they talked. By this fact we can draw the conclusion that Peckham has no right to blame children of not being able to speak normally. I believe that Shirley E. Peckham is exaggerating; children's swearing is not really a big problem, and our language is not in any danger of becoming ruined by a frequent use of swear words. We have been swearing throughout time and will probably continue doing so. And I am not concerned with children's swearing as long as they follow "the rules". They know how to talk decently and they usually do. But if you over-hear a conversation between them full of swear words, you should not be alarmed, not even shocked. When they have grown up, they will talk just like you.
EE242	0	﻿This short essay will hopefully give you, as a reader, an overall impression of how I myself appreciate my general knowledge of English. I will try to give you the answer to the question: How competent do I feel about English? Well, a first reaction to that question is that I obviously don't feel too competent since I've chosen to attend this course in the first place, but at the same time I must feel at least a bit competent since I know that language studies at university level is very demanding and difficult which means that I probably regard myself as competent enough to cope with all that work or at least worth giving it my best shot. The answer to the question will be presented in a kind of listing of, and discussion around, my strengths and weaknesses in each one of the four parts of English that has with reading, listening, speaking and finally writing to do. Reading I've spent 4.5 years at the university, which means that I've come in contact with all kinds of English course literature. My main subject has been business administration and I would guess that around 80% of the literature in that subject are in English. I'm aware that there is a very big difference between reading course literature and fiction but also between course literature in different subjects. This means that I'm probably good at reading and understanding literature with business terminology but not as good when it comes to more fiction work like novels or short stories. Although it may sound, as I'm not very confident with reading English (other than course literature) I still consider that as my strongest side, perhaps together with listening. Listening. The development of my listening skills has been a long story involving school, T.V., films and friends. It probably started at the same time as I begun learning English in school for about 15 years ago and has been going on since then with highschool and some courses at the university, which has been taught in English. The most recent and probably, for my listening skills, most developing part happened during my time as an exchange student last autumn. I spent one semester in the Netherlands in a town called Tilburg, which lies in the very south of the country. All the courses were in English, which was also the language I used in my spare time with friends from all over the world. This has brought with it that I, as I mentioned earlier, consider listening to be one of my stronger skills in English. Speaking Speaking is a very important part but unfortunately I feel that this is not a very strong side for me. I think the problem is that I seldom get a chance to practice actually speaking English. Eventhough some courses at the university has been taught in English that doesn't mean that you practice speaking very much. Most of my speaking practice took place during my semester in Tilburg where I spent a lot of time with three British students. They would often teach me new words and expressions and correct me in a nice way at least most of the times if I pronounced some word strange. Writing This is the last part and probably also the least practised one of the four mentioned earlier. My experience of writing in English consists mainly of a few PM's in courses in Uppsala and a couple of larger essays in Tilburg. Nowadays I practise writing mostly when mailing and e-mailing with my English and Polish friends that I got to know during my stay in the Netherlands. As I mentioned earlier this is probably the least practised part and therefore I think also not a very strong side. This is rather difficult to decide since you seldom get response on your English when writing PM's and letters to friends which for me is the most common way of practising. y overall impression of how competent I feel about my English is that there are sides that I feel I can manage with today, but there are also sides that definitely needs to be improved for me to feel that I'm competent enough. I believe that you can always improve your skills in all four parts but I also believe that you will come to a point where the marginal effect of more improvement is very low. I do hope to reach that point some day, hopefully soon.$$$﻿As long as I can remember I've always been a child and I will probably continue to be a child for the next decades or so. Being a child (although a bit bigger now) I've always been curious of everything and always had a will to know more and more, anxious and restless you might say, and it's true, I was and still is a very energetic person. Well what has this to do with the English language in listenign, reading, speaking and writing?. The following contious prose is supposed to shed some light on my specific relation to the English language. Because of my extrem curiosity as a child, I always tried to ask questions, make my point heard or just slap somebody with a quick joke this meant that I had to make my voice heard no matter what language. And the way I see it I have three main points to take up which has had influence in my English. They are: * My parents * My teachers * My current job as an officer in the Royal Swedish Navy Starting with my parents. They have always been a sort of amatuer-nomads, travelling around the world with me and my sister. All of that travelling forced me to speak all sorts of language but mainly English. As an example: when I was 12 years-old I was sent to Hastings, England on a language course in English. I had to live in a completely foreign family and manage on my own with only three years of English in school. My fellow comrades were 4-6 years older than, I mean, looking back it's pretty young being 12 years-old alone for three weeks in a non-Swedish speaking environment. But I learned some amazing things about England both cultural and social but especially about speaking to natives and listenign to natives. All this travelling has made me very confident in speaking and listening to the English language, as it is today I have no problem at all to communicate even fluently after a couple of minutes (even more fluently after a couple of beers). My teachers during my time has all to the extent of one been very good and supporting. Some of the encourageing writing, other forced it on their pupils, but almost always with good results in the end. I've always loved writing and has always been easy in writing. But somehow I didn't pay enough attention in the grammar classes. And now, looking back, that's one of my weaknesses, grammar. But I have told myself that I'm going to put down as efford as I can to grammar. Surprisingly I find grammar much more amuszing now than I did when I was younger, it's probably a question of maturity. My job has put me on the world scene once more in my life. Now together with my travelling in the past, I've been to every continent in the world accept the North and South poles. I've had lots opportunities to test my English. I remember one special event that put my English ability on the test. We were to board (a strike team consisting of 10 men, fast-ropes down from a helicopter and seizes the ship that is being supposed to be boarded in order to take control of the vessel and make it safe for a search- party to come onboard. They search the vessel looking for illegal aliens, drugs, weapons etc) a Polish landing-carrier of the Polnucha class (they carry marine infantry and amfibious assault tanks up to a company size) during a Partnership For Peace (PFP) exercise in the Baltic sea. When we came onboard everything was a total caos. Soon enough we had seized controll of the ship and started to interrogate the crew. It was my assignment. Soon I found myself in a tricky situation: the crew didn't speak a word of English and no other language, except Russian, for that matter. Since my Russian language abilities is a bit rusty (read: does not exist) I had a problem. After a while I managed to get hold of a man who could speak a little bit of English and a long and energetic interrogation of the crew could begin. When we had gotten what we wanted out of the crew my head was about to explode of exhaustion. My aceing need for some "real" American English was soon to be satisified, soon we were picked up by the US Coast Guard vessel USCG Tahoma on which we stayed for 24 hours as guests. Summing up this essay is easy: I love English and hope that my teachers and this course will help me reach a higher level of knowledge conserning listening, reading, speaking and writing.
EE524	1	﻿ MIRANDA, A BUTTERFLY The Collector by John Fowles, is a riveting story told from the dual perspectives of captor and captive. Frederick Clegg, a newly-rich clerk whose hobby is to collect butterflies kidnaps Miranda Grey, a twenty-year-old art student and he keeps her prisoner in the cellar of his house. This captivating story gives the reader an insight into the minds of the two characters. Frederick is a drab and meticulous person who suffers from feelings of inferiority and he tries to make Miranda understand him. Miranda on the other hand, has a love for life and is a very impetuous yet thoughtful girl who is full of hope. The themes of life against death and Miranda's personal development are in my opinion the main themes of The Collector. This is what I want to illustrate in my essay. In Miranda's diary entry on November 7, she talks about her unbearable situation. "How the days drag. Today. Intolerably long. My one consolation is G.P.'s drawing. It grows on me. On one. It's the only living, unique, created thing here." Miranda sees her painter friend G.P. and herself as representatives of life and art. Frederick in her opinion is just a collector who is not interested in her as a person only her looks. She is only another specimen to add to his collection. On October 24, she writes, "It's me he wants, my look, my outside; not my emotions or my mind or my soul or even my body. Not anything human. He's a collector. That's the great dead thing in him." Clegg her kidnapper is such a dull colourless person who is suffering from a huge inferiority complex. The way he speaks is like Miranda puts it "Cliché after cliché after cliché, and all so old-fashioned,". He is always striving to be proper and he has a personality that is as dead as his butterflies. Miranda cannot stand people like Frederick, she thinks of him as being stupid, petty, selfish and mean. She thinks of herself and G.P. as belonging to 'the Few', the doctors, the teachers and the artists. They have the carry the weight of people like Clegg, and 'the Few' is the hope for the world, she writes, "what hope there is, is with them - with us. Because I'm one of them." 'The Few' represents education, hope and creativity all of which Miranda's kidnapper lacks and she refers to him as Caliban, a sort of monster. "I love honesty and freedom and giving. I love making, I love doing, I love being to the full, I love everything which is not sitting and watching and copying and dead at heart." This is Miranda in a nutshell, full of energy and a zest for life. Frederick has robbed her of her freedom and he keeps her isolated from the rest of the world. She is constantly thinking of ways how to escape. There is the episode when Clegg was nearly fooled by her act when she was pretending to have appendicitis. This episode and her temperamental behaviour makes him suspicious of her, which proves to be to her disadvantage when she eventually becomes very ill. Frederick, her kidnapper is always justifying his actions to himself saying that "I thought I was acting for the best and within my rights." (p.125). His dream is that Miranda would gradually come to like him and eventually marry him and have a family. He also refers to Miranda as his guest, thus justifying to himself that she is not his prisoner. iranda's situation makes her realise that is thanks to Clegg that she develops, and in her diary entry on December 5, she talks about her personal growth. "I would not want this not to have happened. Because if I escape I shall be a completely different and I think better person. Because if I don't escape, if something dreadful happened, I shall still know that the person I was and would have stayed if this hadn't happened was not the person I now want to be." Miranda learns through her suffering and she discovers herself and society. I see Miranda as a butterfly that goes from the pupa stage and then develops into a beautiful butterfly, and then just like a butterfly she dies. Frederick, Miranda's abductor spots another victim, a girl whom he looks upon as "Someone ordinary I could teach." (p.287). She looks a bit like Miranda, but she is not as pretty as her. He thinks he was aiming too high with Miranda, and he does not want to make the same mistake again, next time. Frederick and Miranda are two worlds apart. His dreary personality reeks of nothingness, he is like an unwanted weed in the garden. Miranda is so unlike him full of vitality and she stands out as a vibrant colour on the palette, and she never seems to lose hope. Her captivity makes her develop and mature, while Clegg her kidnapper stays the same without any personal growth. The Collector is in my opinion an extraordinary psychological thriller that I can read again and again.$$$﻿ "The argument has commenced.... Slavery will every where be abolished, or every where be re-instituted." In 1841 an antislavery convention was held in Nantucket in the USA. Frederick Douglass spoke about his life as a slave for the first time, after he had escaped from his bondage in the South. William Lloyd Garrison was at the convention and heard the runaway slave who spoke of his life in slavery. The speech made such a deep impact on Garrison, and the two of them became strong advocates for the abolishment of slavery. On the other hand there were George Fitzhugh along with William J. Grayson and Edward A. Pollard who argued for slavery, and they believed that it was necessary for the wellbeing of the blacks to be kept as slaves. In my essay I have presented the arguments for and against slavery, from the texts I have read. I would like the reader to bear in mind that the arguments for slavery outnumbered the ones against. This might have created an imbalance in my essay. When Frederick Douglass made his first speech at the antislavery convention he started off by apologising for his ignorance. Filled with embarrassment he reminded the people who were present that slavery was "...a poor school for the human intellect and heart,..." (p.1) Then he started to tell his life story of when he was enslaved. Lloyd Garrison was really touched by Frederick's speech and he became an even firmer believer in the abolishment of slavery. The way the slaves of African descent had been treated was in Garrison's opinion appalling and yet they had managed to endure their situation remarkably well. While being a slave one had to put up with being treated as a piece of property, and it was up to the master to do whatever he wanted to do to his slaves. The slave-holders could even get away with murder without legal repercussion. Garrison said that "By the slave code, they are adjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man, as though they were indeed a part of the brute creation." (p.5). He argued that how people could tolerate a society which treated people as if they were equal in status to that of a thing. "...when all the rights of humanity are annihilated, any barrier remains to protect the victim from the fury of the spoiler; when absolute power is assumed over life and liberty, it will not be wielded with destructive sway." (Garrison p.4). This was one of Garrison's arguments why slavery had to be abolished, since it was his opinion that slavery was inhumane. Frederick Douglass was separated from his mother before he was a year old. This was common practice to prevent natural bonding between mother and child. His mother was a black slave but his father was a white man, he could have been his master but this was never confirmed. The slave owners often indulged in sexual liaisons with their female slaves. The offspring that were born from these liaisons usually had to endure more suffering than the other slaves. One of the reasons for this was because the white wife was constantly reminded of her husband's adultery, and these children offended her. As a result many of these children were sold off to other slave-holders. Douglass and Garrison wanted the blacks to be able to enjoy freedom and to be regarded as equals to the white population. On the other side of the fence were people like George Fitzhugh, who believed that the blacks should be regarded as children and treated as such. He thought that the slave was "...but a grown up child, and must be governed as a child, not as a lunatic or criminal. The master occupies towards him the place of parent or guardian." (Fitzhugh, p.10). He also thought that the blacks were not capable to look after themselves and that they lacked in intellect. This would then lead to the slaves becoming a burden to society, thus justifying for keeping the blacks as slaves. Another argument that Fitzhugh put forward was, how the whites were far more superior to the blacks and therefore they could not live together as equals. Fitzhugh also believed that God did not want the blacks to be like the white people and they did not have the capacity to, for example make money as the white people could. This was another argument which he thought was in favour of slavery. According to Fitzhugh were the black people only fit to be slaves, he also believed that the intellect of a black person was lower than that of a fourteen-year-old white child. He and other Southerners regarded themselves as guardians and teachers for the slaves, thus assuming the role of a parent, in loco-parentis. George Fitzhugh also thought that "...slavery is only needed to protect the white man,..." and white and black people could never be treated equally because the whites were superior to them. In William J. Grayson's The Hireling and the Slave, he said how a slave was much better off than a hireling (someone who worked for anyone who was willing to pay). If one was a slave one did not have to worry about food, clothes or shelter, everything was provided for. Whereas if one was a hireling these things could never be taken for granted. Even if the hireling was a free man he was much worse off than a slave, because he was really poor and often had to go without the basic needs. Grayson also said that the slaves were content and they could be heard singing in the fields while working. At night they enjoyed a social life with song and dance, and on Sundays they could enjoy the day off and spend it praying to God. The slaves were the property of their master who cared for them and they were at his mercy. Edward A. Pollard was of the opinion that the differences of the North and the South were because of them being politically different. The North were against slave-holdings while the South saw this as a part of life. They were forced together in a Union which was as Pollard said "...the forced alliance and rough companionship of two very different peoples." (p.20). He believed that people were more refined in the South and no matter how hard they tried in the North, they could never achieve the same in the North. Pollard even went as far as saying that the people in the North were inferior to the civilisation of the South. He meant that the South had a more serious attitude to life which made them superior to the people in the North and the slaves. It was his opinion that "Slavery established in the South a peculiar and noble type of civilisation." (p.21).

EE089	1	﻿I have lived one year in an English-speaking country and during that period of time I learned many new things about the English language. But I'm not yet satisfied with what I know, there are still many aspects of English that I can and wish to improve. I regret that I don't have a chance to listen to English being spoken more often. Since I don't have cable-TV at my house I don't get the chance to watch American or British TV-channels like CNN, BBC and such, which I believe would be a very valuable asset for anyone who wishes to improve their English. There are always subtitles on Swedish television, and it is almost impossible to both read the text and have full attention for the listening-part. I have once or twice borrowed some audio books narrated in English at the library, just to hear the language, but I found it rather dull and prefer to read the book instead. I have no problems understanding spoken English and I think this might be a natural effect from having spent a long period of time in an English-speaking country in which you hear the language around you all the time. When I first came back from the United States I found it easy to speak English. But as time went by and as I spoke less English I discovered that my fluency and security about speaking English did in some sense decrease. And now after being back in Sweden for three years I have noticed that when speaking to somebody in English it takes me a while to get my accent and fluency back. I have discovered that it doesn't matter how much I read or how much I watch American TV-shows, but to improve and retain the American accent I once had I have to practice talking. It's certainly not fun to talk to yourself, but I think it could be practice enough to just read something out loud every once in a while. Sometimes when I speak English I realize that I don't have the exact words for a specific thing I want to say. I know I have a very limited vocabulary and this can be a problem at times, even though I suffer from this mostly when I'm writing. It seems that even though I do read a lot in English, I don't learn that many new words that I wish I was. I know I need to put more time and effort into learning new words, but when I read a book I don't want to put it down to look a strange word up all the time, even though I know this is a good way of learning new words. But the effort that this demands takes away the amusement about reading the book. I really wish that I had a better vocabulary, and regret that it is so difficult for me to expand it. I don't come across that many situations where knowledge of English is required in my everyday-life. I have been writing letters in English for many years and started writing to some American people when I was around twelve. I think this was a good way for me to get to know another side of the English language from the one I heard on TV or learned in school. I still write to some of them and this is, apart from reading some novels in English once in a while, the most active contact I get with the English language in my everyday life. Since writing includes so many different kinds of areas e.g. spelling, grammar, vocabulary etc. this is where I think you can discover whether a person is good in English or not. At times I find it very difficult to write in English, it might be hard to now the exact expression for a certain thing or uncertainty about grammar and spelling. Even though I'm not satisfied with my knowledge in English as it is today I know that my spending a year in the United States has helped me quite a lot, in the sense of fluency and vocabulary. And some of the words I learned there might not be of any valuable use in an everyday conversation in any other country but the United States. But it's fun to know these words and different kinds of American brands or makes when they are mentioned on TV or in a context of any other kind.$$$﻿ More Swedish pop groups should sing in Swedish Pop groups and pop stars play very important parts in teenagers' lives. They identify with artists or groups in many ways, for example by paying much attention to the lyrics of the songs. Increasingly more Swedish pop-acts gain success abroad and as a result to this more Swedish pop groups tend to start singing in English. Unfortunately it is practically obligatory for pop groups to write their lyrics in English, if they want to become worldwide famous. Those who sing in Swedish might be successful in other Scandinavian countries, but not in the rest of the world. When a Swedish pop group does gain success abroad, other Swedish artists realize that it's possible to come from Sweden and at the same time have worldwide success. And since it is essential to write English lyrics, they do. I believe that this development is bad for the young people in Sweden who need various musical role models. Since their Swedish idols don't sing in Swedish, they might feel that English is more "cool" and that the attitude towards Swedish might get worse. Swedish teenagers need music in Swedish since the language, among other things, helps them to feel connected to others and increases the feeling of belonging somewhere. Just as much as they need role models in real life, they need other forums where they can find guidance and identify with others, through magazines, TV-series, books and music. When trying to find people and opinions to identify with, music-wise, I believe it is important to find lyrics that they really understand and speak to them in their own language. Teenagers need young role models from their own country who have been growing up under the same circumstances and have same experiences. Listening to an American rap about American society couldn't be the same thing as listening to a song about the Swedish situation. The many new Swedish pop acts that have aroused lately support this argument. The need for good music in Swedish has been obvious this winter, when Swedish pop charts have been crowded by new, young Swedish music. Groups like Lok, Petter and Kaah express anger and frustration that have been recognized by many Swedish teenagers and probably wouldn't have had the same penetration if the lyrics were in English. The need for this kind of music is obviously enormous. These artists have had the same upbringing and sing or rap about the same society as Swedish teenagers live in and know. Groups who sing in English, and have the urge of gaining success outside of Sweden most often sing about things that people in different countries can rely to. Unfortunately many Swedish pop groups don't seem to put that much of an effort into writing idiomatic English lyrics for their songs. They seem to write what they think sounds like good English, even though in many cases it don't. The English they perform, and which teenagers adopt, is not as good as expected. The demands for a lyric in Swedish to be perfect are much bigger than the demands for the ones in English. Many artists have been complaining over the years that writing lyrics in Swedish is too hard, and that English words have a better sound. But I believe that it just takes longer time to complete a good Swedish lyric and those who has been worked on usually turn out quite well. It is however more or less legit nowadays to spice up Swedish in general with some English words and expressions every once in a while. I believe that the penitration of English in Swedish society is too rapid and unnecessary. The loanwords from English might lead to an impoverishment of the Swedish language and it might be used as a shortcut; instead of inventing new words we borrow English words. This development might arouse even more since teenagers today are used to having English around them all the time. They watch American TV-shows more frequently than Swedish ones and they listen to music in English. These are just two examples of the big flood of new English influence. English has become an increasingly common input in Swedish society; Swedish people don't even seem to react to this fact anymore. Teenagers are used to Swedish ice hockey teams with English names, companies and different brands are other examples. The message they get is that English is a better language than Swedish and that English should be used preferable. As long as the cool music is sung in English and the not so cool music is sung in Swedish, this situation strengthens. Perhaps the government or some other department should in some way encourage young people to write more music in Swedish. It's not up to me to say exactly how this would be preformed, but I think that much could be done to make the Swedish music-scene more various and vivid. In short, the Swedish teenagers of today need to feel that their language is just as good as English. One good way to strengthen this opinion is to provide good Swedish music for them, with artists with the same background and with similar experiences. They need role models from the music industry that they can rely to.
EE088	1	﻿ Test the mental health of the police force The last couple of years the reports about police officers being too violent while making an arrest or supervise an event have increased dramatically. Before I moved to Stockholm I did not know much about this and had never met anyone who had been exposed to this. But now almost half of my male friends have some experience from police brutality. And to tell the truth, I'm scared of the police. I don't know if this is a phenomena only found in big cities. But on the other hand that should not matter. Because of all this I think the policemen should have to be mentally tested, not only when they apply to the education, but also at least every fifth year during their professional career. Last weekend there was a demonstration in Stockholm against police brutality, because of an incident the weekend before that, when a lot of youths were beaten and arrested by the police for blocking and painting the street. It might be that it was necessary for the police to interfere but the police is supposed to use the least violent method, which they could not possibly have done. Another example of police officers being to aggressive is one of my boyfriend's experiences. It happened at a soccer match. The policemen pulled two of his friends in to their bus and beat them with truncheons, although Swedish police is not even allowed to use these any more. And may I point out here that all these boys had done was to refuse to leave the cue to the mobile shop where they were standing. When they refused the police provoked them, by calling them names, to yell at the them. Hardly something you deserve getting beaten for! About a year ago a young girl was molested and by policemen treated in an inhuman way at a police station after she was arrested. I do not think this is the way it's supposed to be! But on the other hand we can't take away the police officers. They are after all here to make the citizens feel secure and to protect them and stop criminal activity. And we need them. Before accepted to the police academy the applicants are mentally tested to make sure they are suitable for the job. You would think that this would mean that the police officers are mentally stabile, but obviously something is happening over the years that makes them more aggressive. I think it is very hard to find out what that something is, and until someone does and the problem with violent police officers can be solved, I think all police officers mentality shall be tested at least every fifth year. Society have a lot to win by doing so. First of all people like myself, who hear a lot of scary examples about police brutality can stop being afraid of them and get some respect back instead. And if the police stop provoking youths to be violent there would not be so many fights all the time between young people and the police. Now, it's almost as if the police are creating their own jobs by causing disorder. As it is now, many youths have no confidence in the police force and every now and than you hear young people say that they hate the police, and I don't think that's something they just say to act cool in front of friends. The police need to regain some respect and the best way to do so is to stop provoking people, stop using more violence than necessary, and for this to be possible the quality of the police men has to be higher. Those who abuse their position has to be told not to do so or be removed from work. We can not have a society were people are afraid of it's lawmen. Therefor we need to test the mentality of our police, so that we have a chance to find those who are not suitable for the police work.$$$﻿ Evaluation - English, My English! Recently, not much more than a month ago actually, a thrombosis was found in my brain. And as if that was not bad enough, the thrombosis had caused several cerebral haemorrhages. Part of the reason to why this was discovered was that I lost my ability to speak and write - I simply didn't know the words, or the letters for that matter, and I could not spell at all. I'm not completely healed from this yet, but I am much, much better. Luckily neither the thrombosis or the haemorrhages has done any lasting harm to my brain, according to the doctors. But because of this it's kind of hard for me to say how good or bad I am in the different areas of the English language right now. But I know that I've always loved words and sentences, stories and text, and not just the English ones. Since I was fourteen, I've been wanting to move to England. And I know that before this illness of mine I used to think of myself as a pretty good English speaker, when it comes to pronunciation and finding the right words - at least for someone who has never been to England or the US. But most of the time I'm a bit too shy to speak as much as I ought to, I think. So, you'd think that a person who speaks quite good English also is good at listening, but I'm not. It's not that I don't understand, more like I don't hear what people are saying. I have bad hearing, I'm aware of that, but this might be because of something else. I don't know. One thing I'm sure has been effected by my thrombosis is my spelling. I've gone from being a person who makes few mistakes when it comes to spelling to being a person who's really bad at it. I loose letters and sometimes even whole words. The same thing happens when I read, I just don't know the words in front of me sometimes, not even the most simple ones. And I'm absolutely sure it wasn't this way before I got ill. But enough about my illness! No. I've never been a good reader, not even when I read swedish text. But still I love books. Unfortunately I don't seem to be able to find the time to sit down and read. But I do realise I need to do that more often. Don't get me wrong here. I'm not what you'd call a "bad reader". I understand the text perfectly well, perhaps better than some other people, who would consider themselves to be good readers, it's just that I read very slowly. But I don't think that is that much of a problem. So, what have I got left? Writing of course! I love to write! I've written three and a half full length books, in swedish though. But I also love to write in English. I have a homepage on the internet and on one of the pages there, called "stories" my boyfriend and I write a new shorter story every week. It's so much fun and to judge from the comments we've been getting from our visitors, we're pretty good at it too. And yes, I agree. I'd like to think of myself as a good author, at least when it comes to fiction. Essays, like this one, are a bit harder to write, but I have not had that many chances to practice, and nobody has shown me what it should be like. When I said I thought of myself as a good writer I didn't necessarily mean that my grammar is good too, because it's not, not always. I just happen to have studied a some swedish grammar, which I try to apply to the English language, and sometimes the two don't really match. But in total I guess you could say that I'm one of these mediocre students who wants to become a teacher in English because of a genuine interest in language rather than high skills. And therefor, I guess, will have to work hard to pass this education, but who, for the same reason, will find that it's worth it.
EE520	1	﻿ Monarchy - obsolete in a democratic society Today in Sweden the monarchy and its representatives, the royal family, are enjoying great popularity. But is there actually a place for such an institution in a modern, democratic society? I would say that there isn't, and below I shall seek to explain why this is so. A monarch is, by definition, someone who has inherited his or her occupation as the head of state of a country. This of course has not only purely professional implications; it also brings with it a certain status and a position as a national figurehead. Even a monarch without any actual power or political influence holds an important position as a representative of his country. It is therefore quite remarkable that someone is to be born into this function; in a democracy of today a job such as this should not be the private possession of a specific family and because of this the monarchy is in itself undemocratic. As this is obviously a matter of principle, it might be argued that such concerns are of little practical importance when it comes to a merely ceremonial regent such as the king of Sweden. On the other hand, when regarding it from the monarchs point of view, it is indeed very much a practicality; his personal freedom and his ability to choose his life is actually greatly limited from the very moment of his birth. He has the theoretical possibility, of course, to abdicate, but since this is not a very common event it does hardly present a realistic alternative. Such a restriction of individual liberty is not usually associated with a modern democracy. But, some might object, having a figurehead such as Sweden's ceremonial monarch is indeed important; our king is our countries main representative abroad, a national symbol. This is true in as much as having a representative person on an international level could well be said to be important. But because this actually is important, it is only natural to assume that we would want to choose for ourselves who is to represent us. A monarch, who has only inherited his representative duties, is obviously not necessarily the most suitable person for this office. An elected head of state, a president, could on the other hand to a greater extent than a monarch be said to actually represent the people. The duties of this elected head of state might still be mainly ceremonial; the president wouldn't even have to be a political figure and there doesn't have to be any danger of too much power being concentrated in one person, as some might indeed fear. Are there no advantages of having a monarch, rather than ceremonial president, then? Well, some people would perhaps argue that the institution of the monarchy and the circumstances surrounding it has a value in itself, that it adds a touch of glamour to the country and that reading articles in weekly magazines about the extraordinary lives of the royal family adds an indispensable joy to the dreary lives of the so called ordinary people. However, we may very well ask ourselves if such an attitude actually belongs in a modern society, and to this I must answer that it doesn't. The media hype surrounding the monarchy in general and the royal family in particular is horrifyingly reminiscent of times long since past, when humble respect towards the regent was demanded of the lower classes. The king of today is nothing but a curiosity, but is still sometimes surrounded by the attention bestowed upon his more despotic predecessors. This sort of public indulgence in the worship of royalty might be considered comparatively harmless, but does nevertheless preserve an image of a social structure that is no longer relevant. One might of course also consider this matter from the point of view of the monarch and his family; constant exposure to the public eye gazing through the distorting lens of the tabloid press is an attention that they have little choice but to accept. All together, this shows that a monarchy could not be said to belong in a modern democracy; not only is it undemocratic in itself, it is also unsuitable for the functions it is supposed to perform and severely out of date, perpetuating an old class system. An elected ceremonial head of state would clearly answer better to the demands of our time.$$$﻿ Aspects of televised violence Violence in the media, and particularly in the television medium, is an issue of growing interest in a time when the amount of medial information is continually increasing. The more television channels that are made available to the viewer, the more difficult will it be to control exactly what programming is carried over our televisional doorstep and into the deceiving safety of our living rooms. Certainly, all of the material on offer might not be considered suitable viewing for all categories of viewers; what about, for example, the effects of broadcasted violence on the impressionable mind of a child? This is, however, no simple issue. Violence on TV falls into several categories and must therefore be discussed accordingly. The effect of televised violence is not a matter to be easily decided on. Some might for example argue that there exists an obvious connection between violence on TV and the increasing amount of violence among teenagers and children. However, blaming this violent juvenile delinquency solely on the influence of television is perhaps making things a bit too simple; other factors are bound to come into it. That is of course not to say that TV is completely without guilt in these matters; being an important part of the lives of most young people in our part of the world, television is presumably an issue as important as any in this context, and therefore well worth discussing. What kinds of violence might we as viewers encounter then, and to what extent should they be regarded differently? There is of course there is the obvious distinction between non-fictional and fictional violence; on one hand the violent scenes that might occur in daily news broadcasts and documentaries, on the other hand the dramatised violence shown in various movies or TV series. The non-fictional violence would, to some extent, seem to be a necessary part the function television is expected to perform; presenting news from a violent world could hardly be done accurately without displaying a certain amount of violence. However, this is not an altogether straightforward issue; in recent years the tendency in some parts of the world seems to have been towards news broadcasts including more and more explicit violence of a kind not occurring in such programs before, such as live broadcasts of dramatic crime situations or violent car chases. The public interest of showing this type of real-life drama could be debated, and one might argue that this is a clear example of unnecessary violence on TV. Here in Sweden however, this is not a very common phenomenon, but as we are nowadays able to view a large number of foreign channels broadcasted by satellite, we also have to consider matters such as this. If the non-fictional violence presents a somewhat complex issue, so does by all means its fictional counterpart. Not only are there variations in degree of violence, but we also have to take into consideration the different categories of violent content that is to be found. There is the "entertainment violence" of violence of the thriller, the action movie and similar genres, but also the category of fiction where the contained violence is not as much an end in itself as a part of a whole, not entertainment as much as a necessity of the story being told. In discussing these matters there are thus several important questions that we must ask ourselves. How should we for example treat different kinds of violent fiction, what should be restricted and how should we impose these restrictions? For instance, most people would probably agree that programs containing extreme or excessive violence should not be screened when young children are likely to be found within the audience, some might even argue that extreme violence on TV should be banned completely. However, the latter view could perhaps be seen as a dangerous simplification of the problem; even regarding the extreme one could actually distinguish between the meaningless excesses in entertainment violence of the low quality action film and those instances where explicit description of violence might be said to serve a purpose. Deciding what is to be shown on TV and what is to be kept out or restricted, and how these restrictions are to be implemented, is indeed not a simple matter, but one that requires much discussion and consideration. Anyone interested in restricting the televised violence would certainly have to make distinctions as exemplified above, difficult as they may sometimes be.
EE248	1	﻿INTRODUCTION. I have been studying English during a long time, some way or another. But if I really wanted to assess my abilities and my competence when it comes to making use of my English skills - where would I find myself? How secure and confident do I find myself when I use my English in practice in the different fields of listening, reading, speaking and, of course, writing? How well do I perform and how do I manage when I use my English in real life? This evaluation will be highly subjective, since it will give my own judgement about the question. I will try to evaluate my English skills and weaknesses in the areas mentioned above - listening, reading, speaking and writing. I will start with a short summary of my English educational background. Y EDUCATION IN ENGLISH. I started to learn English as a ten- year-old girl at school. I do not recall that I had problems with the language. I think I was quite an ordinary pupil and throughout my school-time I managed with the language fairly well. I did not go to the upper secondary school. I married, worked and when I got my second child I studied English at Kom-vux, upper secondary level. Now I just loved it and I managed well with my studies. The following years I used to read English books to keep my English skills in order. Last year I studied English, course B, upper secondary level. I also made the test to get access to university education and I passed the test quite good. That is my educational background, and it could be of some use to summon it up in order to evaluate the present state of my English abilities in the provinces listed earlier in this essay. HOW DO I COPE WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN PRACTICE, THEN? When I l i s t e n to people who talk English I think I cope quite all right. I have no difficulties in understanding my teachers so far. I can listen to Euronews, for instance, and I understand most of what is said. Even though a single word could be unfamiliar to me, I get help from the other words and in this way I can follow the main theme. It can be difficult with different dialects but in general I think I can handle the listening part good. How do I manage the r e a d i n g part? That is similar to the listening part, I think. Reading is even easier than listening because when I am reading, I have the asset of the word remaining in front of me, and I also have time to think - and there are other words, a coherence that can help me. I use to read such books as 'The street-lawyer' by John Grisham without problem. But Neil Postman's book 'Amusing ourselves to death' has a much more difficult language - the book will give me some difficulties to come to grips with. It is a question about vocabulary. My talking abilities, the third province in this evaluation, what are they? This is the part I need to develop the most, since I have not had enough opportunity to talk to native English people. They do not grow on trees - not in Sweden, anyway! I still feel insecure when I talk to people. My skills when it comes to writing, then? Perhaps my reader could give a better answer than I. If I would rank my skills I would say I am better in listening and reading than writing English, but better in writing English than talking English. But of course there are a lot of possibilities to do mistakes when you write English: The demands for accuracy are higher when you write than when you talk. Conclusion. When I use my English I am best at listening and reading. I think my writing skills are somewhat lower and my talking skills are the weakest part of my English competence. It will be thrilling to see how much I can improve during my first term at the University!$$$﻿ THE FAMILY, NOT THE STATE, SHOULD DECIDE WHAT SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND! INTRODUCTION. Sweden has a long history of centralised power, even since Gustav Vasa and the other autocratic kings into present times with our strong central government in Stockholm.. Surely the situation with the very long period of social democracy in governmental position prepared the ground for the comprehensive school system we have today. The intention of providing all pupils with an equal and good education caused the government to impose the comprehensive system in the 60's. The government's aim was not bad. They wished that more people should be able to attend further and higher education. Earlier that was impossible for a lot of persons. Since a more conservative government got the power in the 80's the uniformity of the situation has altered. We now have a totally different situation. I wish to discuss why it is absolutely essential that the parents and not the government have the power and right of decision about what school their children shall attend. The same arguments are valid about the importance of parental freedom to decide upon what kind of child care they prefer. WHY, THEN, IS IT SO IMPORTANT THAT PARENTS CAN CHOOSE SCHOOL - AND CHOOSE ANOTHER SCHOOL THAN THE STATE SUPPLY? First of all, it is a human right to choose school according to your religious or philosophical belief. This is clearly stated in the United Nation's declaration of human rights and also ratified by the Swedish state. The elementary schooling should also be free of charge, says the same declaration. But of course, this is not the only reason why it is so important to have a possibility to select. Another reason is that when people feel that they can affect this aspect of their childrens lives, they feel responsibility too. They feel urged to attend parents meeting at school and take a greater interest in their childrens schooling. CAN'T THE FREEDOM TO SELECT A FREE SCHOOL CREATE A SEGREGATED SOCIETY? This is a very interesting thought you often hear from opponents to free schools. Could it be that such schools would consist only of rich and successful people's children? And perhaps - a even worse thought - only of white people, no immigrants and their descendants? No, I would say, whit the present system when the money follows the pupil every pupil has a chance to go to an independent school. When the money comes from the tax revenue, justice is maintained. It should NOT be a question of money if a parent wants to send his child to a non-state school. The segregation in Sweden depends on housing policy. This is a greater problem for the state comprehensive schools since wealthier people just can move from a problem area while others just have to stay and have their children in a sometimes bad school - if they don't have a choice. CAN'T THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE ANOTHER SCHOOL IMPOVERISH THE STATE SCHOOLS? This is a common question among defenders of state schools as the only alternative. I would say no, again. On the contrary, since competition will force the state schools to be better or at least as good as independent schools it will benefit the whole society. Monopoly has never been a good option. In a initial stage an independent school could cause a small increase of the education costs in a local place, if the classes are very small. But too small schools do not get permission to start. An independent school usually gets 85 % of a state schools budget in Sweden. CONCLUSION. The main reason why parents should be able to choose schools for their children is that this is a human right and a part of the freedom a citizen should enjoy. But it also good if the parents get more involved in their children's schooling and if they feel they can choose, this is a consequence. The competition between state and independent schools will create better schools and it would be stupid to go back to the previous situation.
EE539	0	﻿This text will deal with my knowledge in the English language in four different aspects: listening, reading, speaking and writing. I never felt that I had a problem to understand the englishteachers in school and now when I listen to lecturers at the university, who use a higher level of the English language then what I'm used to, I still don't have a problem to follow even though they use many words that are new to me. None of the lecturers that I had so far had a dialect that I thought was difficult to understand. Certain dialects that are spoken in some parts of England are sometimes hard to understand. For example if I watch a English movie without Swedish text in which the actors speak a dialect that sounds very different from the English that I learned in school I can have difficulties to understand it. This problem I never had watching movies where the actors spoke any kind of American dialect. I've been to the States for vacation and then I understood all the different kinds of American english that I heard. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to go to England so I don't know how my understanding would be there but I met quite a few English people in other countries and they used so much slang that I felt rather lost! When it comes to my reading in English the biggest weakness is probably that I never read, it's not easy to relax and read a book if there are a million other urgent things to do. In the past two weeks I actually red more English then I did for several years. I thought that it was much easier to understand then I expected it to be and that includes both instructions and literary texts. When I speak of understanding I'm not talking about every single word rather the sentences as a whole. Normally you understand approximately what a word means if you have a circumstance to refer to. That doesn't mean that I don't think that I have to learn the word. To improve my English vocabulary is actually one of the two main challenges that I have to deal with this term. As improving my vocabulary is one challenge the other one is definately to get a better knowledge about the English grammar. I didn't study English for a long time and it's amazing how fast you forget things that you once knew. Actually I can't even remember having grammar lessons in the "gymnasium", instead my teacher forced us to read "Hamlet", written in a very old English. I can't say that anyone appreciated it then and I really don't think that I developed my knowledge of the English language in a positive way in those years. Partly because of this but also the lack of practice in recent years made me suspect that I'm not very good at English grammar. According to my result on the diagnostic test that we had the first day of this term, my suspicions can be considered as confirmed. Especially the translation part wasn't very good, I really don't understand why the result on that part was worse then others. When I write a text like this, the most obvious weakness about my English is that my vocabulary isn't big enough. Actually it's not only unsufficient it doesn't include enough words that are considered as a higher level of English or more professional synonyms to the words that I use. If there is anything that I would call a strength about my writing that would be my lively imagination that makes it easy to come up with a story for essay or just to start writing, something that most people think is the worst part of the writing process. That is of course nothing special for my writing in English. To speak is what I'm best at in my knowledge of English. Of course I also have the problem with my insufficient vocabulary when I speak but normally I don't feel the need to use words of a higher level when I'm speaking. When I was in school, I didn't say a word more than necessary in the English lessons. I wasn't only shy but also ashamed and unconfident about my English. After finishing school I went abroad for a year, one of the purposes of that was to improve my ability to speak English. The country to which I went, wasn't a English speaking one. That may sound strange since I wanted to practise English. Anyway that was the idea, I spoke English every day with the people there and because of that it wasn't their mother tongue either I became more self-confident about my English. Now I like to speak English so I'm really satisfied with the out coming of that year. Now I feel ready to work hard to improve my vocabulary.$$$﻿At the very moment my competence in English is not too good. Right now you wouldn't believe that I've studied English at school in ten years, I don't. I'm also quite ashamed to tell to Englishspeaking people that I'm going to become a teacher in English. One of the comments on that information has been: "Well, as long as you're not going to teach my children." I think that the fact that I haven't used English at all in quite a long time, and that during that time I've worked hard to improve my skills in Swedish, affects a great deal my capability to produce the language myself and also to understand it, both in written and spoken form. Although listening and reading feels easier than speaking and writing at the moment. In this internationalized society, that we are living in, we can hear English everywhere: on TV, on the radio, in the streets, in the cafés and restaurants, in the shops and so on. I think that it's a reason why I feel that listening to English is easiest. I mean that even though I haven't been active and used the language I haven't been able to avoid hearing it every day. I also think that I listen to English more fluently because when I listen I don't have time to seize on every single word that I may not know but generally I can still follow what is going on. Reading feels also easier because I have the text in front of me and somehow I can work on it more actively. I can check up words in a dictionary and I can go back to an earlier page to control that I've understood the text correct, for example. I've recognized that when I read a text I seize on single words that I don't know quite easily. The problem is that it takes so much extra time to check up the words in a dictionary although it would be good for me to do it considering the weakness of my vocabulary. But that extra time is something that I can't afford in order to manage to accomplish all the other things I'm expected to do. The weakness of my vocabulary has effect on all the four fields, listening, reading, speaking and writing, but especially on speaking and writing. That's because I think that my active vocabulary is even weaker than my passive vocabulary. I mean that I understand more than I can produce. The fact that also complicates things for me is that I have to try to deal with two for me foreign languages, English and Swedish, at the same time. So even the weaknesses in my Swedish vocabulary affects my studies in English. The most difficult field and at the same time the most effective way to learn the correct language in my opinion is writing. It's difficult because of the weaknesses in my vocabulary, like I mentioned before, but also because I've forgot the English grammar quite well. However I'm not so worried about the grammar. I think that the part that I've forgot comes back little by little while I'm working on the language. I also think that grammar is something that I can improve by grinding away at it, just learn it by heart, and exercising a lot by writing. Above all I have to try to learn from mistakes, avoid doing the same mistakes over and over again. It's weird but it's always harder to find strenghts than weaknesses. There just seems to be weaknesses instead of strenghts and bigger weaknesses instead of weaknesses. Anyway, as a whole I have to evaluate my competence in English as weak at the moment. Nevertheless I try to think positive. I know where I am and I'm aware that it's going to take a lot of hard work to improve my English. I have to sweat blood but I'm ready for that. I'm going to do my very best and we will see if it's enough.
